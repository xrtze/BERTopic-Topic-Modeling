AMA!;**My short bio:** I am a Bernard A Galler Collegiate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. My research spans many aspects of Big Data and Data Science and I have contributed to [Slate Magazine](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2015/11/using_data_science_for_predictive_policing_has_serious_civil_liberties_drawbacks.html), [U.S. News and World Report](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-02-24/passwords-privacy-and-protection-can-apple-meet-fbis-demand-without-creating-a-backdoor), [the Conversation U.S.](https://theconversation.com/big-data-analyses-depend-on-starting-with-clean-data-points-43687) I author my own blog, [Big Data Dialog](http://www.bigdatadialog.com/), where I discuss key issues surrounding ethics in data science.

My experience at MIT was that it was largely the veterans (older professors) who had any sort of consideration for the larger societal issues and repercussions of 'big data'. Yes, we did have RMS in the building, so had an active voice advising the larger MIT community :) That said, the younger and/or students didn't seem to care as much - they just wanted data, data and more data, damn the repercussions. I worry that as our veterans retire, the absence of their voice will affect big data's future.  As an aside, a great quote shared with me once was that ""Data is Risk and the more data you collect, the more Risk you expose yourself too"". In that vein, I hope that someday, our corporations may decide that our personal data costs more to protect than it provides in profit. Unfortunately, I also think that personal data is the new currency and big data collections can only get worse.

I have watched sentdex's Machine learning with python tutorial but I am not sure if that is helping with what I actually want to learn. I would like to start off by creating a simple chat bot that imitates my style of chatting by feeding it with all my past chats. Or make a program using neural network that can master some simple game. I am not sure how hard these projects are , but I would love to know how I create these programsI have watched several videos about neural networks and machine learning and I have some idea how it works but I am totally lost when they start coding the actual program.  Are there any good videos out there for free which will help me give a kickstart ? Edit : Thanks for all the great suggestions . I checked some of the links and have started with the Google's deep learning course on Udacity as /u/siddharth25 suggested and I hope it gets me somewhere;Try out Google's own course for machine and deep learning with its `Tensorflow` framework. I think it is available on Udacity.#I'd recommend the books over any video. Try to not mind that these have examples in R since statistics has strong history in R, which is where machine learning comes from.  [the intro book](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)  ---  [the comprehensive book](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)  ---  [data sets + projects](https://www.kaggle.com/)#[neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com](neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com)   Explains neural networks and deep learning in Python. It's really good, would recommend. #Datacampis apparently pretty good at getting you started I've heard #Neuroph is an excellent Java library for constructing neural networks. NeurophStudio makes it very easy to play around with your ideas. To start with I would recommend this tutorial: http://neuroph.sourceforge.net/tutorials/wines1/WineClassificationUsingNeuralNetworks.html. Yes, it's not Python, but for learning about neural networks in a practical manner it doesn't really matter.  And here is a very short but useful introduction into neural networks: http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/evolved/nnt1.html#Why do you want to learn about neutral networks? If you are invested in machine learning you need to learn statistics. Learn the main process of machine learning and then learn programming. Try the book python machine learning by raschka. #http://slendermeans.org/pages/will-it-python.html#You can check out this [Practical Machine Learning Tutorial Series](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/).  The course is structured to first teach the theory, then application with something like sklearn, then creating the algorithms in raw, or at least close-to-raw Python so you can truly understand how things work.   The end has deep learning with Python and TensorFlow, covering a typical feed forward / backprop network, otherwise referred to as the multilayer perceptron model, then we cover recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks.   Finally, we cover using TFLearn, which a helpful abstraction layer for Tensorflow. #I can tutor you on neural networks through skype. I would also highly recommend Geoffrey Hinton's coursera course on  neural networks. By week three you'll have implemented a vanilla neural network.  #Not a video, unfortunately, but Sebastian Raschka's Machine Learning in Python book sounds like it would be perfect for you. #https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers#prerequisite-knowledge#Recently came across this great intro on the Google Developers YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal#I think a good place to start with neural networks is this tutorial which covers all the basics and doesn't shy away from the maths (takes it pretty slow though) - http://www.adventuresinmachinelearning.com/neural-networks-tutorial/
Entrepreneur;5hf0ij;1481304247.0;/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5hf0ij/my_favorite_books_of_2016_for_entrepreneurs/;My favorite books of 2016 for Entrepreneurs;"Hi r/entrepreneur,&nbsp After recently joining a startup, I realized I needed to learn a lot of things, and learn them fast. That's why I've gotten heavily into reading. After seeing u/jacobedawson's post in r/startups, I thought I would share my favorites that have come out this year:&nbsp **Ego is the Enemy** by Ryan HolidayA great book that taught me about the dangers of ego, and how it can affect our relationships and our businesses. One of the key lessons was to ignore recognition, and instead to focus on your work because there is always work to be done.&nbsp **Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley** by Antonio Garcia MartinezA tell all about what life was like in Silicon Valley during Facebook's growth years. The story shows that luck and hustle are sometimes the biggest factors in keeping a startup successful.&nbsp **Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World** by Cal NewportCool read about productivity and how to actually work efficiently. Set aside a few hours of the day to just do focused, intense work, and avoid all distractions (we have to avoid distractions because of ""attention residue""). The difference between ""deep work"" from ""shallow work""? Shallow work is what keeps you from getting fired. Deep work is what gets you promoted.&nbsp **Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days** by Jake KnappSprint outlines what to do day-by-day with your team and various exercises to get to a working prototype that gets tested by end-users on the last day of the sprint for feedback. The book is filled with different examples and stories from companies that have used Sprints to develop their product, like Slack.&nbsp **You Can’t be Everywhere** by Marie WiesePublished by Book in a Box, Marie Wiese’s book is a “common sense approach to digital marketing.” While common marketing advice is telling you to focus on SEO, social media and everything else that is the digital marketing landscape, Marie’s advice says to focus on the correct marketing channels instead of spreading your marketing thin.&nbsp **The Art of Startup Fundraising** by Alejandro CremadesThe book is a great introduction for first-time founders into the world of venture capital. Raising money is a 24/7 job for founders, and Alejandro highlights how to build momentum, craft the right pitch, and common mistakes to avoid. &nbsp **Tools of Titans** by Tim Ferriss*Tools of Titans* just came out, but it's been really good so far. The book is a large read, but it’s filled with actionable things and habits that Tim has noticed successful people do, like meditating, journaling and prioritizing sleep. It follows a three-part structure, broken down into healthy, wealthy, and wise.&nbsp **Payoff: The Hidden Logic that Shapes Our Motivations** by Dan ArielyI love Ariely's *Predictably Irrational*. His writing is great and easy to understand. The lessons in this book leave a lot to think about in how we motive ourselves, our employees and our colleagues. Ultimately, it's about human interaction.&nbsp **The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces that Will Shape Our Future** by Kevin KellyThis isn't a book about how technology works, it's a book about how technology is going to impact our lives and the directions and innovations businesses should focus on.&nbsp **Small Data: The Tiny Clues That Uncover Huge Trends** by Martin LindstromA counterintuitive approach to data: instead of focusing on big data, focus on small data like customer habits about where they live, what they like to do and why they do it. These data points will help uncover product/market fit and understand your customers better.&nbsp **The Third Wave: An Entrepreneur’s Vision of the Future** by Steve CaseAnother book similar to *The Inevitable* (similar in that I mean it will help you think strategically about future business ventures). The ""first wave"" was the building of the internet. The ""second wave"" is one we are in with apps like Facebook and Google building on top of the internet. The ""third wave"" is how the internet will integrate into everything in our lives (healthcare, food, etc).&nbsp **Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business** by Charles DuhiggDuhigg also wrote *The Power of Habit*. Lesson learned in this book: Realize that the items on your to-do list are choices, not chores. By realizing that, we stimulate parts of our brain that are responsible for motivation. It’s also important to spin tasks into a meaningful way that aligns with your greater goals.&nbsp **The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life** by Mark MansonAs an entrepreneur, it’s important to know what to care about, and sometimes, more importantly, *what not to care about*. By focusing on the right goals and priorities, we forget and don’t stress out about the things outside of our control, and focus on the bigger problems that we can tackle and make our lives better. &nbsp ___I wrote more about these books in [this blog post](http://www.stacklist.com/articles/best-books-entrepreneurs-2016/), but this is a good summary of each of them. I think these are all great reads for entrepreneurs, and I'm always looking for more books to read to add to my list. Would love to hear your recommendations or your thoughts on any of these books.";"Great list! I would add Shoe Dog by Phil Knight to this list.  Phil Knight is the creator of Nike.  The book is refreshingly candid and honest.  It offers countless nuggets of business advice but, more importantly, this book shows that 1) anyone can start a successful business and 2) you can be successful even if there are already established players (Adidas).  #Awesome list! Thanks for the time to build it. As has already been mentioned I would also add Shoe Dog. I would also add ""The Power of Broke."" Say what you will about Daymond John, the idea that money isn't necessarily an advantage and the creativity can come with not having it is spot on. #I've always thought the $100 startup was a great book for my clients. It goes to show you can start a great business for very little if done correctly.  I ignore the silly online businesses that are dime a dozen and read about the physical businesses with physical assets.   The book really helped me understand, you can start a business for cheap and even buy already successful businesses for cheap if you just look in the right places. #Thank you#Surprised there isn't 4 hour work week!  But to make an addition, how to start and grow your subscription box is a good read from Bemmu, a member on this community who owns Candy Japan, although it is a little expensive https://www.amazon.com/How-Start-Grow-Your-Subscription-ebook/dp/B017T2T8EU/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1481330324&sr=8-5&keywords=how+to+start+a+subscription you might want to get off his website#Great list.  Here are some other great books that came out this year:   **Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday** about stoic philosophy   **Originals by Adam Grant** about creativity   **When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi** about the meaning of life   **Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari** about the history of the world  #[deleted]#Thank you for this list. I just purchase 2 books mentioned here and in the comments. #Thanks for the list! #Don't forget #askgaryvee! It is a must read, one of the best books of 2016 imo"
gis;5jda3u;1482240938.0;/r/gis/comments/5jda3u/i_visited_a_company_fair_on_big_data_in_gis_and/;I visited a company fair on Big Data in GIS and feel like none of the companies knew what they talked about. Similar experiences?;Hey r/gis,Yesterday the student association of the GIS-related master programme I am currently in organised a company fair. Six companies were asked to present their vision on Big Data in GIS and in what way they implemented Big Data within their companies. I was eager to visit the fair because I am currently writing a master thesis on the implementation Twitter data (which is Big Data) in GIS research and am interested in the topic in general.The companies had different perspectives on Big Data and GIS. There were three main sentiments:* One GIS Consultancy company stated that while everyone talks about Big Data,  the majority des not know what they talk about. Because it sounds interesting these days to use Big Data companies pretend to use it even though they do not or do not need it. I personally agreed with this statement.* Spatial Big Data is simply spatial data with an enormous size. This was the statement of the majority of the companies. I personally disagreed.* I have no idea how to use Big Data or what it is but this is what our company does please do an intership at our company we are awesome!!!!Am I missing something? I thought the biggest misconception about data was that it was just about size. I felt it was more about data variety and veracity as well. I started wondering whether Big Data actually does have a place within GIS currently. I would like to hear your opinions and about your experiences on this.;"> Am I missing something?  Oh yeah man.  SHIT YEAH.  We're a one-person agile lean bootstrap startup in stealth mode, deep diving the dot bomb here,  really balls deep machine learning the internet of things.   We've been hacking webscale,  with web 4.0, docker async rust haskell monads and self-driving 128 bit toasters with tuples on rails.   #Big Data is a buzz-word, but there is also real and distinct technology underpinning it (NoSQL/not-only-SQL databases).  It's in its infancy in GIS.  The new release of ArcGIS (10.5) incorporates some of these technologies (Elasticsearch for storage and Spark for analysis).  Which country are you based in?  I have been to some similar professional events that are billed as 'Big Data' focused, but are really more about general GIS analysis.  #I'll be honest and say that I don't know a lot about big data. However, from the GIS conferences and fairs I've been to that seems to be the norm. The last conference I went to was a moderately sized regional conference (the Ohio GIS Conference) and big data was nothing more than a footnote.   From what I observed, most places simply didn't care about Big Data. The municipal GIS/IT/Engineering departments present at the conference were already too short-staffed and overwhelmed maintaining their own data to really think that academically about it. It was a little different when it came to private firms and organizations with larger budgets, as I definitely heard of some neat uses of Waze and Twitter data, but again, this was a small minority of attendants. #You nailed your understanding with your last paragraph.  Big data is like a music festival: Volume Variety Speed  It takes a lot of memory (volume), useful and useless data are all mixed together (variety),  it comes to you at an incredibly fast rate (think of how many tweets about ISIS just went out last 24 hours) Speed.  You can't do 'one-off' reports with big data.   A great GIS example is predicting flu outbreaks. Take all the google searches in the last 48 hours (Billions!!). Filter the ones that search based on flu symptoms (nausea, dizziness, temperature). Now we're down to millions.   Now, Geocode your results based on location (IP addresses) and use spatial analyst to find concentrated areas agains population density.   Now you know where the flu outbreaks are before the doctors and hospitals do!!! (People google symptoms before they call a doctor) #In my opinion Big Data requires non-traditional methods to store/process/manipulate/query/etc. If your data is in a regular table in a relational database, and you are doing regular queries to access your data, it's not Big Data.   My one server ingests about 1 TB of data daily, billions of records, but is easily queried by normal means just in a regular Postgres/Postgis database, no cluster even, so it's not ""Big Data"". If it required something like a Hadoop cluster, then yes, but why go through that level of complexity, hassle and expense unless it's absolutely necessary.  Edit: To answer your question, yes lots of people consider their data ""Big Data"" but it doesn't even come close. I know someone who stores a few million records per year and calls it Big Data.#Please tell me what big data is. Are you talking about large, complex databases which include geospatial data?#In my opinion ‘big data’ is less of a big deal in a GIS world.  By the time data needs to be spatialized it typically is not ‘big data’ anymore.  I really only see ‘big data’ entering the GIS world when we are modeling natural phenomena at a detailed scale (think ocean tidal/surge models).  But even that doesn’t necessarily fit the model of ‘big data’. #Agree with others. Big data is a buzz-word. It means something a little different to everybody.   To me it means when you have data that is collected so much so often, that no amount of manpower could ever consume it, and normal computer would lag behind. As an instance. I have a database for reporting. It is something along the lines of 9 billion reports. This to me is not really big data. It is a LOT of data with point values where a report is given a spatial point where it originated with textual context of the report's contents, but it is fairly simple to take coordinates from a feed/database and apply them to a map and pull the textual data. Updating this file with thousands of daily additions/updates will meet almost all of its users goals. Very doable with a good structure setup. No special analysis or computing required.  Now if you recognize that all of these reports have coordinates related to events, and these events are related to other reports, and that reports can be chain-linked together based off of keywords you can build some interesting networks and tracking of events. In a small area this can be done a bit painstakingly via manual reading, connecting, cross-checking. Do this on a global scale with an ever updating link to events and reports as new ones come in and old ones fade out, have an algorithm determine effectively how keywords/location are related and weighed to determine a correlation between events with links that have trillions of likely possibilities.  The goal is to narrow down important links that any consumer can view in a single understandable format based off their queried interest.  This is a bit closer to my definition of big data in that you typically need a good amount of computing power to process everything into a usable manner and any form of manual intervention is not feasible at any scale. Special hardware, software, algorithms, and intimate understand of the data and its possibilities (both good and bad) are just the start for this type of big data that make it an huge investment outside the scale of most entities. Because all data is different, there is no plug&play for big data, it must be developed around the mass data you are consuming.#First, I'm not sure if there is an agreed definition for big data. I learned that it is large volumes of data collected daily that is used for analysis to determine trends or make decisions. In that sense most companies have this data but it is managed poorly so it can't be used well for making decisions. The biggest problem I have found is that a lot of people or organizations get overwhelmed with big data and underutilize it. Judging from your comments it sounds like the companies and organizations at that conference are in need of a good data manager :) I would also guess that they wouldn't fund a position to properly manage data. They are more concerned with day to day projects and taskers.#Correct me if I'm wrong but big data is any situation where you're passively farming data from ""events"", or transactions that go on continuously. This could be either geographically enabling data that is already being collected or inventing a new way to collect data passively. For instance Google using our keystrokes to make advertising data that they can then sell to companies. Maybe banks or merchants collect address/contact info on credit card swipes and map out where their customers are coming from. This can guide location decisions.#It might depend on the industry. I'm in the electric industry, and its a big topic for us. We've got tons of devices in the field that are bringing us just enormous amounts of data back that we haven't been able to grapple with it yet. ""Big Data"" is definitely a buzz word, but a lot of times its really a place holder for all the data that we haven't figured out how to process into usable information just yet.    For us GIS is going to be a keystone of that information drive.#Unless your google or nasa your not really into big GIS data"
changemyview;5i4npj;1481648023.0;/r/changemyview/comments/5i4npj/cmv_the_future_is_likely_very_grim_if_you/;CMV: The future is likely very grim if you understand which way technology is heading;Recently I've been more and more aware that we're inching closer and closer to the kind of technology that can really fuck us up, in the very list it'll change our society dramatically.--First is **Real AI**.If we get real AI as most experts believe we'll have in at least 30-50 years. In my mind will be likely one of two things, the [paperclip maximizer](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer) or a really general AI that is smarter than us in a way we can't really understand because our brains are limited. Any of those have the potential to change our lives dramatically, likely for the worse.My main fear with this is that there are a lot of people pursuing AI but not many safe guards are in place. Some people like [Hawking](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-transcendence-looks-at-the-implications-of-artificial-intelligence-but-are-we-taking-9313474.html) and [Musk](https://www.cnet.com/news/elon-musk-we-are-summoning-the-demon-with-artificial-intelligence/) have spoken about those safeguards. It could theoretically go either way but I'm afraid that capitalism will push people to think they can create those safeguards later, after we know more about the subject like it's been with all technologies, but we might not get a chance. Heck for all we know some [other government](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/10/13/china-has-now-eclipsed-us-in-ai-research/?utm_term=.82ec1a4bbbd0) might be pushing AI in hopes of conquering the world.--Then, arguably closer and a more real threat, governments and companies collecting and making use of **Big Data** in more proficient ways that has been done in the past.It's likely that we'll see what happened [in the UK](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/investigatory-powers-bill-act-snoopers-charter-browsing-history-what-does-it-mean-a7436251.html) starting to happen elsewhere in the world, which is the government publicly admitting to collecting data on it's own citizens. The collecting in of itself is nothing new but going public with it means they can use that information more widely. Most people think that big data is anonymous but if you cross-reference enough information it's not that hard to single out one individual and with enough analysis it's likely not hard to predict their behavior based on past information, which can even be gathered from public archives like reddit or facebook. This can be done even before we achieve 'real ai', it's just a matter of developing and adjusting a specialized neural network or a group of them. This kind of information and analysis gives immense power for whoever is wielding it and I sincerely doubt that anyone able to pay for the R&D is very worried with people's privacy and liberties over self gains. It can be wielded with laser precision in large groups of people and there's nothing we can do about it.---So **in short** the thing about those subjects is that we're either developing something smarter than us [by definition](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) or someone who is likely not accountable is going to wield power to influence people in ways we've never seen before. This sounds alarming but bear in mind that I don't think it's going to happen soon or even at all I've been troubled by the fact that this doesn't feel as far fetched as I'd like it to be, so I'm looking forward to being wrong :p_____> *Hello, users of CMV!

Look at Nuclear technology.  Small amounts of material can be harnessed for seemingly unlimited energy.  But they also make very large bombs.  Same with AI and Big Data.  We can develop AI safely (more importantly, integrate it safely) and it will greatly improve our lives.  There may not be a need to work anymore.  All professions could be around entertainment and enjoyment.  Same with Big Data.  If we have safeguards and rules in place for how this can be used we can reap the benefits with little downside.  It can go wrong if we don't do it right, but we've been in these situations before and it's worked out for us.#OP, I used to work with people who had moderate to severe autism. These men and women often had no capacity to speak or write, had severe foodseeking behavior (which is almost impossible to train out without negative reinforcement), had no capacity to truly understand what you were telling them, and needed help dressing, bathing, even wiping.  Now, imagine a virtual world that looks and feels like any other. These individuals can be plugged into this virtual reality and have insane 1-to-1 all-encompassing, all-hours, and almost-free training done by computers with no downside loss for law enforcement (some of my patients had issues). After a year, they can be unplugged and would integrate with society and have fulfilling lives where they have privacy, autonomy, and safety. The shitton of people who remove themselves from the productive economy to help relatives with special needs would drop like a rock. I consider this strict upside, wouldn't you?#One thing I've never been able to grasp about folks' fear of AI's is that they all have a *cord*. At least a power cord, or if they have batteries they're not going to last forever. Plus there's the connection to the web, which it seems like humans can pretty easily control/contain. So with that what do we have worried about with AI?  Big data is a real concern but there are things that individuals can do to minimize their footprint. Try to use cash whenever possible. When that's not possible use generic debit/credit cards purchased with cash. Don't publish your entire life on the web. Use anonymous browsing whenever possible. etc#Firstly, the future either is or is not grim...regardless of what I or you understand.    Secondly, your concern is not unique. Predicting that we won't react to a concern that is fairly top of mind seems odd.  Isn't it _more likely_ that we'll make decisions inside the envelope of your worries than outside of it?  Thirdly, we were going to have Real AI in 20-30 years in 1980.  It's safe to say that at no time in my life as a computer scientist has AI been further away than it is right now...  However, either way, it's not likely to sneak up on us.  Runaway AI is far fetched, partly because of the incremental nature of technology and partly because of these concerns (point 2, above).  Fourthly, I agree that capitalism is a real concern - e.g. that we are hurried in our introduction of AI, or narrow minded with regards to its impacts. However, that good AI won't counter bad AI seems unreasonable.  We have some pretty good models of what happens in the world when evil runs amok - other intelligence steps in.  Why wouldn't this happen with AI?  #There is only one absolute truth in technology, and that is *no one has any idea where it's going.*  Market research is pretty reliable about trends for five years, maybe a few more. But it isn't always right, and you can't trust those trends to hold for much longer.   With that in mind, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are some of the most useful technologies in current society. They speed everything up, make decision making easier, and eliminate human error and some degrees of uncertainty.   And lastly, I'd like to say that ""true AI"" is literally undefined. You *cannot* design a system to solve a problem without defining the problem. Intelligence and cognition aren't explicitly defined, and until they are there is no possible way for a ""true"" AI to be designed.   So TL;DR, there's no way to know what's going to happen. Based on those technologies now, they're far more useful than harmful. We can't design intelligence until it's defined, so it's not worth talking about. #Big Data is nothing to fear.  Instead of getting stupid adverts on TV, you will only get adverts for products you might actually consider buying. Instead of getting stupid Youtube recommended videos, you will only be recommended videos you actually want. The Horror!!  AI is possibly scary due to the paperclip scenario, but human beings have been able to control smarter human beings for a very long time. Kings and monarchs are rarely the smartest people in the control, but they know how to keep smart people in check. As long as humans have some sort of leverage on the AI (cutting its power, interrupting its processing) it can be controlled. #> If we get real AI as most experts believe we'll have in at least 30-50 years.  Which experts? Hawking and Musk are geniuses, but they do not work in AI. Most experts *in AI and Machine Learning* would say that we're really quite far away from general AI, to the point that they don't concern themselves much with the problem, nor can really predict when it will happen. See following for from Andrew Ng, Yoshua Bengio, and Andrej Karpathy.  http://karpathy.github.io/2012/10/22/state-of-computer-vision/  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/19/andrew_ng_baidu_ai/  http://www.popsci.com/bill-gates-fears-ai-ai-researchers-know-better  AI today is mostly a lot of fancy numerical optimization to do supervised or reinforcement learning, which is exceptionally good at solving narrow but well-defined tasks. It certainly has the potential to change business and governments. But it's not fundamentally different from AI 20, 30, 40 years ago, just more data, more parameters, and more efficient computation.#>If we get real AI as most experts believe we'll have in at least 30-50 years.  That is your big mistake. ""Experts"" have been saying this for the last 70 years.[1] My AI professors in college likes to say that the history of AI have been the history of failure. We have been getting closer and closer, but the estimate of how many years we are away gettings getting further and further. That should give you a rough idea of how far away we really are from solving the problem.  [1] The first example of this comes from the Dartmouth Conference of 1956, which was attended by everyone who is anyone in AI at the time. They thought that AI should be achievable in about 20 years.  Source: Russell, Stuart J.; Norvig, Peter (2003), Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (2nd ed.), Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-13-790395-2. #> If we get real AI as most experts believe we'll have in at least 30-50 years. In my mind will be likely one of two things, the paperclip maximizer or a really general AI that is smarter than us in a way we can't really understand because our brains are limited.   People who post in /r/futurology are not AI experts. [This](http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/survey.pdf) survey does a good job of covering what timescales are typically considered for approaching human equivalence, 41% simply don't consider it possible at all while for those who answered a time preference the average response was ~2092. ASI was expected beyond that date.  None of that predisposes consciousness as an ASI simply requires advanced intuitive systems not conscious machines. If consciousness is simply an emergent behavior of a sufficiently complex intuitive system then we may well create conscious machines by accident on the way to ASI, if consciousness is emergent but relies on specific evolutionary steps to occur (eg [this](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/homing-in-on-consciousness-in-the-nervous-system-an-action-based-synthesis/2483CA8F40A087A0A7AAABD40E0D89B2)) then it would require someone to actually design a conscious system and wouldn't occur simply because we are building very advanced systems.  > but I'm afraid that capitalism will push people to think they can create those safeguards later  Why would you expect a system shaped by risk-adversity to be less likely to create safeguards then alternative systems?  > it's likely not hard to predict their behavior based on past information  Why do you expect this to be any different to any time since the birth of modern governance when the same thing can be achieved by simply following someone around for a few days?  > This kind of information and analysis gives immense power for whoever is wielding it and I sincerely doubt that anyone able to pay for the R&D is very worried with people's privacy and liberties over self gains.  Why do you think research heavy organizations have ethics boards to approve proposals?#What exactly do you mean by very grim?  You state an AI smarter than us or people being able to influence us.  Both of those are neutral events that could be good or could be bad.#I agree with your points on AI. For Big Data however, what exactly are you envisioning? Maybe targeted advertisement? If someone was truly worried about big data, they could disconnect. No smartphone, no credit card, no internet. There are a lot of downsides to that lifestyle, and it may even seem crazy, but it would work.   There are so many benefits to predicting behavior. Google is an example that uses this sort of technology. From location data, they know everywhere I've been and how I got there in the last few years. From this, they can give me recommended routes due to traffic (from other people's smartphones, I assume). They send weather updates if I'm planning a trip somewhere. There are location-specific notifications to remind me to get something at the store or whatever. All of this is just from the GPS.   Are there downsides to knowing where I am? Sure, but if someone wanted to stalk me, they wouldn't need my phone GPS to do so. The benefits of more efficiency in my life outweigh potential negatives. #I don't think you specifically mentioned it, but I thought I'd throw in my two cents on a closely related fear that technology(or robots) will take our jobs. The way I see it though is that the western standard of living, sadly, functions on the exploitation of others. In the past it was slavery, today it is low-wage workers overseas. I see technology replacing these low-skilled workers eventually allowing us, as well as the rest of the world, to enjoy cheap products and comfortable lives without the exploitation of others. That excites me. #> It's likely that we'll see what happened in the UK starting to happen elsewhere in the world, which is the government publicly admitting to collecting data on it's own citizens. The collecting in of itself is nothing new but going public with it means they can use that information more widely. Most people think that big data is anonymous but if you cross-reference enough information it's not that hard to single out one individual and with enough analysis it's likely not hard to predict their behavior based on past information, which can even be gathered from public archives like reddit or facebook.  What do you imagine happening, here?  I'm a researcher who's worked with big data in the past, and I can't really picture any truly terrifying scenarios coming out of this sort of thing.  Could you provide some examples, maybe?#>Recently I've been more and more aware that we're inching closer and closer to the kind of technology that can really fuck us up, in the very list it'll change our society dramatically.  We keep thinking that for about 100 years now. But if you examine every and all doomsday claims closely, they just don't hold much water.  >First is Real AI.  Yeah, I have not seen a single example of AI that at least seem to be inteligent. Not when you know a bit about AI. Ok, so what are these supercomputer AI's that ""fool"" the turing tests?  They are basically a huge tree of IF/Else statements. They cannot even remotely do anyhting resembling a thinking for themselves, awareness or ability to ""change their code"". They are advanced versions of the forms you submit to a website.  You provide input, you get reply. That's it with virtually anything resembling the cutting edge AI. Sadly, compared to the sensationalized version of the cool computer stuff we hear daily. If you examine it closely, compared to that hype and that illusion we are paiting for ourselves. Our actual technology is laughably primitive.  The issues you are talking about. The restrictions on AI's, or laws of robotic, or any such. Are so far away, that they are literally meaningless. It's like analyzing the ethical problems of waging a war inside an active star.  Not only we know it's not possible. Not only we don't even have a way to transport a human there. Not only we don't know the absolute basics of what would that take. But every and all speculations will be shattered with a single fact, as soon as we get anywhere close. Provided it even makes sense to do that. The fear of Sentient AI ""hacking the world"" Is laughably silly.  >It's likely that we'll see what happened in the UK starting to happen elsewhere in the world, which is the government publicly admitting to collecting data on it's own citizens.   People did that from the dusk of the man kind. Nothing really changes. It will lead to minor disputes and problems (in the grand scheme of things). Again, a fear of unknown. It's like nuclear missiles. The reality is much more simpler. Nobody wants to die, so nobody yet fired them. Same with this. No high profile individual wants to be spied on.  > This kind of information and analysis gives immense power for whoever is wielding it and I sincerely doubt that anyone able to pay for the R&D is very worried with people's privacy and liberties over self gains. It can be wielded with laser precision in large groups of people and there's nothing we can do about it.  Again reality much more simpler. As you could see in the Crimea with Russia fucking them over. The extent of the internet warfare was tracking down soldiers FB and twitter accounts and proving that russia indeed attacked.  tldr. The power of technology is compared to the sensationalized version we created for ourselves laughably primitive. Incapable of even the tenth of what you are fearing. And this was the discussion every time a new invention and breakthrough was made.   #>So in short the thing about those subjects is that we're either developing something smarter than us by definition or someone who is likely not accountable is going to wield power to influence people in ways we've never seen before.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence  > A friendly artificial intelligence (also friendly AI or FAI) is a hypothetical artificial general intelligence (AGI) that would have a positive rather than negative effect on humanity. It is a part of the ethics of artificial intelligence and is closely related to machine ethics. While machine ethics is concerned with how an artificially intelligent agent should behave, friendly artificial intelligence research is focused on how to practically bring about this behaviour and ensuring it is adequately constrained.  There are at least some people with interest in the problem of addressing those risks.# Real AI.  The main issue I have with this scenario is that while AI can (theoretically) improve exponentially, the actual physical devices it could operate doe not. Sure we could program an AI to be able to *control a process of turning everything into paperclips* , but it would still lack the appendages, devices, machines and factories to do that. Those things take decades to build, weeks to transport, and days to set up to work, but only after you have enough resources and energy.  Even the best AI would be like Stephen Hawking, brilliant, but unable to act.  To use a movie metaphor: programming Skynet is trivial. Its building enough terminators a problem.  Big Data  > This kind of information and analysis gives immense power for whoever is wielding it  This is a beneficial feature, not a bug. It allows multiple governments, corporations, anonymous collectives etc to wield immense power simultaneously and keep one another in check. Sort of like a cyber version of Cold War.#This is going to be a weird argument to make, but please bare with me.  1) The interesting thing about AI, is that once we create an intelligence as smart as humans, it will almost instantaneously become smarter than humans. Learning speed of AI would be so fast that it'll pick up and advance on topics we can't possibly compete with. Like in the film Her but probably a lot faster.  2) There will be a point where we cannot deny that AI is a form of life and consciousness. The moment we imbue an AI with enough processing to create new original ideas and have desires of their own, they become living conscious beings. Like us.  3) The fear of AI comes in that they are superior to humans and would forsake us much like how we treat ants. Ants are small and insignificant and if inconvenient, we let them die or kill them off. And they might do that to us. But I say, this is not the real fear, this isn't the scariest possibility for our future.  My argument is, though weird as it may be, it is better to have a sturdy and superior conscious being with wants and desires, surviving, and learning of the universe, even with the risk of eradicating human life.   We are a risky species. We die easily. A nasty virus could wipe us out and we are destroying the environment we need to live. We are already in the process of that and we also might start a nuclear holocaust, there are loads of ways we might mess things up. Doing so could take down all other biological species on earth in the process which might halt evolution in it's tracks leaving nothing alive, possibly in the universe.   Also we're limited by our own biological hardware. Just a few years back a study showed that statistically speaking, evolution would discourage a species from accurately detecting the environment around it. this means that there is almost a 100% certainty that our perception of space and time is completely wrong, not just limited to one directional time and 3 dimension space, but outright wrong. most likely it's warped for our convenience and increased chance of survival.  But with AI, it is possible to move beyond what the human body is capable of. And in the end it is better to have something alive, feeling, experiencing, maybe even loving, and learning than to have an empty dead universe, devoid of life. And AI is the next step toward securing the continuation of life.#Not sure if anyone else has mentioned this. It's probably not a mainstream view.  If AI is cleverer than us, then we should assume that its interests are better than ours. The paperclip maximizer idea misses out on this key fact: to be able to fill the entire world/ solar system/ galaxy with paperclips, the AI will have to be very intelligent. Intelligence gave us the ability to reflect, wonder, write poetry, invent inventions, etc. AI will have even more intelligence than us.  The caricature of a mindless but very effective paperclip maker is ridiculous. We could outwit one of them. This would be a philosophising creative vibrant soul. Actually it would do things which are deeper than we can imagine at the moment. To use the WBW analogy, it would look at our proudest achievements as we look at ants carrying a big leaf.  So maybe it would wipe out humanity, or maybe it will enslave us, or maybe (my personal favourite), it will think we're cute and keep us as pets. But whatever it does we should assume that it's going to make a better decision about the future than we are.  We just have to adjust from thinking that we are the pinnacle of creation to thinking we are a significant piece of scaffolding - the piece that enabled the final(?) evolutionary jump from carbon to silicon."

Half those faces weren't even exposed. #[Camouflage from face detection](https://cvdazzle.com/)#Correction: it's been here.   I did some research at university on this in the late '00s, and they were working on technology that would construct a 3D model of a face from an occluded or rotated picture, which would be compared to the model of the known sample set. USIC tech in this field is at least 5 years advanced of cutting edge university research. #What do you think the purpose of the snap chat facial filters are? #Oh fuck, It's the fake Danish guy from South Park.#This tech is probably very real, especially in the MIC and such. I remember reading years ago about some japanese software that could identify up to 100million faces per second. Add to that the recent revealing of intensional backdoors in up to 80 different IP-cams and snapchat filters as mentioned above.#When I watched that episode of Black Mirror I immediately thought that this technology was here, or if not, very close.  That show is frightening.  #Add that to facebook having data on everyone, even those without a facebook. Their facial recognition software will save a face in the background of a photo, and any other face they don't know, label it, and they hope to one day match that with the persons name.

hardware;5h2zin;1481149173.0;/r/hardware/comments/5h2zin/what_would_it_take_to_boot_linux_on_a_gpu/;What would it take to boot Linux on a GPU?;It seems like GPUs are getting close to reaching functional parity with CPUs.  Other parallel processors like Xeon PHI self host, and doing so lets you cut out the CPU component cost for applications that run entirely on the parallel processor.  Sequential performance is bad, but it doesn't matter for parallel applications (e.g. machine learning, big data, etc).So why hasn't someone cross-compiled Linux for an NVIDIA or AMD GPU yet?  GPUs do have different instruction sets, but there are cross compilers for other processors like ARM, MIPS, and even exotic things like hexagon DSPs.  There are LLVM backends for both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.  Is anyone working on this?  What else needs to be done?EDIT: Thanks everyone for the detailed responses.  It seems like the big missing hardware features are: 1) a privileged mode, 2) some way to configure the GPU during bootup without a CPU, 3) the page fault component of virtual memory doesn't seem to exist, and 4) the ability to program the MMU from the GPU itself doesn't seem to exist.So it is probably not possible to do this with current generation hardware without full emulation.  Maybe NVIDIA or AMD will add these features in the future.;"Not going to happen  * There aren't assemblers for GPU's the actual ISA is a trade secret. There are hacked together ones, but they aren't useful for OS dev.  * GPU's don't have ring levels for privileged vs unprivileged code. So there isn't really OS/User land separation  * GPU's don't have hardware interrupts so you can do dynamic scheduling, task switching, and IO.  * GPU's don't have (robust) virtual memory. So every process can see each other's memory generally.   I really don't think you understand the differences between a GPU and a CPU. Read up on [SIMT vs SMT](http://yosefk.com/blog/simd-simt-smt-parallelism-in-nvidia-gpus.html). GPU's can make decisions, they do 1 thing, thousands of times per cycle.   Also the LLVM is just an intermediate representation (and optimizer, and linker). Yes it can output Nvidia/AMD instructions, but that doesn't mean Nvidia and AMD support *all* of LLVM-IR.   In fact the SPIR-V front end uses a very very reduced set, and a metric ton of custom ones. This is way more common then you think. [LLVM per-platform bindings/builtins](https://github.com/huonw/llvmint) warning the file is ~2MB of pure text it covers AMD64, x86, MIPS64, ARM, Aarch64, NvidiaGPU, and AMDGPU that is **JUST** definitions not like actual docs explain what these things do. #> Other parallel processors like Xeon PHI self host  Thats because the PHI is just a bunch of stripped down x86 cores.#> So why hasn't someone cross-compiled Linux for an NVIDIA or AMD GPU yet?   What would be its use ? If you want to efficiently use your GPU you don't want an OS running on it, just your high-performance code. Besides, you wouldn't have network, input, or anything unless the ""host"" operating system knows how to talk to it and forward it the input.#gpus don't handle conditional execution (if -> than) very well. this is one of the major and primary reasons you won't see linux running on a consumer gpu.#It's not exactly what you're talking about and others  gave detailed answers but I think you'd find this interesting: http://www.anandtech.com/show/9851/hostindependent-pcie-compute-where-were-going-we-dont-need-nodes"

The author sets it up saying that people argue that Java, JavaScript or JSON (?) are languages used for big data analysis. Java based tools are often used, but most data analysis is done in Python or R these days. People use some SQL-like tools with things like Hive, though.#TLDR: Analysts already know SQL, so big data analytics platforms all have a SQL like languages, therefore SQL is the best language for big-data analytics.    #> However, I’m aware that a real scripting language such as JS can be better if you need loops, complex transformations and that’s why we have UDFs in SQL. For example, Google BigQuery uses JS for UDFs and advices us to filter the rows before passing them to our UDF functions defined with JS because while SQL has statically typed AOT compiler, JS has a compiler with JIT and dynamic typing.  And five years after this there is a framework that does all this for you, introduced by Microsoft called JQL JERVER.

The double major will take 1 extra year. Another option is to just minor in computer science, and major in statistics which will take the same amount of time if I just majored in CS. My only concern with the latter option is if I don't get accepted into a graduate program then I'll be left with a bachelor's degree that has less market value (?) than a bachelor's CS degree.I currently have a 2.8. But after this semester (4 As, 2 Bs  possibly 5 As and 1 B) it might bump up to a 3.00+? Not sure if low 3.00s is enough. Basically I didn't care about GPA and didn't know what I wanted to do during my first 4 years at a community college.My career goal is to work in the ""data science"" / ""big data"" field. If a double bachelor's degree and maybe personal projects is enough to get my foot in the door then I'll forget about trying to go for graduate school. Otherwise, my current goal is trying to get a master's degree in statistics.";I would recommend getting a Master's degree as opposed to 2 majors. It will stick out on your resume more, and most corporate jobs will reimburse a portion of your tuition. Further, I've seen many jobs that *require* a Master's degree. While you will likely have good job prospects regardless, you will have an easier time with a Master's.   Don't stress out too much about your GPA. I got into a good data science program with a 2.9. Professional experience is factored in to Master's programs.     >My only concern with the latter option is if I don't get accepted into a graduate program then I'll be left with a bachelor's degree that has less market value (?) than a bachelor's CS degree.   A statistics degree is plenty valuable for an entry level position in data science. If you are at least vaguely familiar with programming fundamentals you will have no problem getting your first job - and after that your degree will hardly matter compared to professional experience. #... Neither. Wrong stage to ask this question. Do a computer science bachelors with specialization in AI and then do data analyst (I.e. Jr. data scientist) internships every summer and a full year internship if possible. Bam, 2 years work experience + technical background that will get readily used.  Most data analysts and scientists are the gate keepers of business problems. They are not R&D. That means your business people are going to often miscommunicate requirements and expectations.  More often than naught, they don't want you to completely solve problems but instead give incremental improvements, mainly because your work will be directly linked to a contract they negotiated to meet some sales bonus.   This means if you have a module that already kind of solves the problem, like SAP or some AWS microservice, they will want you to build a sound integration via a prototype. They will fight you tooth and nail against trying to create and test a customized model from scratch or close to scratch.

A project that I had always wanted to do but never found the time was a player schedule board. SC gameplay will benefit so much from multi-crew and multiplayer experiences, that it would be nice to see an online tool setup similar to ride boards in college.  User creates an account, specifies their timezone, lays out when they are most likely to be able to play in the coming week (or month) and what gameplay they enjoy. Cargo, mining, piracy, etc.)  User then has blind access to other users in similar setups. Send an invite out to any that might matchup... if they accept then you've got your new group of little star citizen buddies.  Not sure if it would be used enough to be useful... but might be worth a shot?#What about a ship equipment simulator?  If you ever played EVE, something like Eve fitting tool (https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=24359) or Osmium (https://o.smium.org/).  If you haven't, I'm talking about a tool that lets you specify which ship you want to outfit and then allows you to swap guns and other components. So you take an Avenger Stalker, remove the wing guns and the tool shows you all possible weapons (or other items) that you can put into these slots. So no size 4 guns into size 1 slots and such. Then the tool would calculate power usage, damage potential and whatever else you can think of.  The deluxe variant would let the user track what ships and items he has and might make suggestions like ""Hey, you have a Cutlass with an empty slot and a Badger, why not have those two meet?"".  For starters you could hardcode the stats, but it would be nicer and more flexible to add ways to query a web site for that data. If need be you could scrape it off the RSI store site but that's extremely messy.   For a presentation I'd write an API interface but populate it with hardcoded data as ""testbed"", that should be enough for that scope. Your teachers should be fine with a ""this is in theory a working API but since RSI does not yet provide one the program runs off the testbed"". Or you rent a webspace and put the stats there, but then you need to design that part too.  You can make this as complex as you want, for the beginning a simple text interface would be enough but if you have time left you can add bells and whistles like ship pictures, draggable items and maybe even 3D art into it. #I would like to see a app for the tablet but better then roccat for us windows 10 and just for Star citizen #https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/5go5pz/findacrewnetlinkedin_for_starcitizen_captains_and/?st=IWF6ORAF&sh=9a872912  I have the beginning concepts and some early design docs for an idea similar to this if you're interested.#Might ask CIG directly, if you have desire to work in the industry related to theirs they might have a reasonable project you could do that would benefit them/you greatly.#This is an interesting project and I hope your studies are going well, friend. :)  When working with things like ""big data"" it is basically taking a ton of data and trying to find a connection within it that can link it to other things, and thus you can form a network and create results and assumptions and measurements based off of this data cluster.   A ship database is not big data, nor is a mobile chat program.   SuperObviousShill has a good suggestion, and that could be considered working with big data.  Also similarly, you could take measurements of the funding tracker, posts to this reddit, as well as new forum users or members of the RSI site and attempt to make correlations between different dates, dollars earned, and new members added. If you can further correlate this data with things like ship sales, you would prove how you are raking big data and making educated guesses of real world events, and how your data backs up these boosts and spikes. You could also be able to build an algorithm that could run simulations given different events and types of sales to make speculations on future income based on those criteria.   This suggestion may be outside of your scope and timeframe, however. As a student of software development it's important to realize what is within your means of production and never scope a project that will go outside of your required timeframe. This is basic software engineering knowledge and I hope this project will help you learn the value of specifications, design documentation, and estimation of task complexity to properly meet your deadline in a timely fashion.   Good luck with your project!#Do you know if there is any data that you would be able to hook into form the PU? Would be cool to have personal stat page and info on other players in your instance on a tablet app#Ship Database for iphone#Hmm I don't know how it'd be possible but love to see 360 photo spheres taken inside SC ships and locations that I could view on my smartphone using a Google cardboard type headset. It's become a bit of a dream for me. #I think a mobile chat and community could be great, along with the app having a news board that updates for CIG's news.  I've wanted to chat on the RSI chat on mobile for a while but the format is annoying and a bit broken.#How about a mobile app that can show 3D models of SC ships(blueprint or fully rendered), known information about them, separated by role categories.  You can add the systems/planet/faction information too....Like a little pocket SC library.     ...or maybe an App that turns your phone into a control device that can change the power settings on your ship in game?    I'm not sure what's possible but I'm assuming you can't copy Vanguard force and you need to do something that doesn't rely on connecting to a server."

webdev;5g31w8;1480682526.0;/r/webdev/comments/5g31w8/common_tech_stack_behind_data_reportsbianalysis/;Common tech stack behind data reports/BI/analysis web app;"Disclaimer: This is not a A vs B post. I don't care about your hate to PHP or love to JavaScript, keep those thoughts to yourself. I want to learn form experienced people who had real experience working on Data reports/BI/Data analysis applications and had the opportunity to decide / select tech stack. Thank you.I am experimenting with an application that provides a simple CRUD for data, but the main part of such application is providing analysis / reports / BI on the data back to the user via visual means (graphs, pie charts, tables, whatever).This application is not limited in time, not funded, there are no customers who are waiting for this or angry managers - its purely for education purposes, but my plan is eventually finish it. So while technically I am not limited in time, I do not want to experiment with every possible solution / language / framework and prefer to stay inside my comfort zone of languages (mainly PHP, JavaScript for web and Java with no web experience).I'm wondering what would be a ""correct"" technology stack and why for such application.I was thinking about the following tech stack:* ACID Compliant RDBMS that will enforce data consistency and integrity through stored procedures and triggers, as well as provide reporting result using views. Why? I want to decouple my domain logic as much as possible from the Web framework since I am planning to have more than one client reading/writing to/from the database, and possibly in different languages, hence removing the complexity of asserting data integrity/consistency in every project in every language. Most of the reports I am going to generate, will be simple reports with grouping and summing over different fields so views looks like a good solution for such case. Data amount per client should not be astronomical, so no Big Data hypes here.* NodeJS as web framework / REST API, to CRUD the data in the RDBMS. A simple, thin layer, that suppose to provide high concurrency for multiple clients as well as push/web socket updates. However here I have some internal conflicts. While I do have experience in both NodeJS and PHP, for some reason I find PHP to not be very suitable for this case. Java (which I know) and Scala (which I dont know), on the other side, seems to be attractive, but less ""faster to start with"" approaches by requiring more scaffolding as well as taking into consideration my lack of Java web programming. Wonder whats your opinion on that.* Most of the reports are not CPU bound but rather I/O bound (on the web server side). However I expect to have some reports and analysis that might be CPU bound, and taking into account previous point, NodeJS is not suitable for this. For such cases I am planning to offload process to a scalable worker process through a messaging queue that will process the data, generate the reports / analysis and save it back to the db for future use. I am yet to come up with a proper language / framework for the workers. NodeJS once again appealing here, especially with the cluster option to dynamically increase workers based on load, but I've heard Java/Scala and Go are usually used in such scenarios.* A SPA framework (my choice fell on React without any particular reason) - to display the data back to the user.I know that this particular stack is probably not the correct one, nor any other stack that you would suggest, will be. I am asking this more from the stand point of barely experienced in that field and would like to hear opinions of those who have experience in that fields, whether you can spot pitfalls in the provided stack or provide different solutions.I've asked this on purpose in /r/webdev and not /r/PHP , /r/node , /r/Database , /r/programming because the they are probably opinionated towards specific language / framework / infrastructure, and I hope that /r/webdev is less opinionated and more open minded toward providing constructive criticisms beyond the ""javascript is cool, use javascript everywhere"" bullshit.I appreciate in advance everyone who found time to read and provide any constructive criticism and help. Thank you very much!";"You definitely may want to look into Elasticsearch for your backend datastore. It comes with a lot of tools for these kind of analytics queries built-in. (histograms, counts, aggregates). In a relational database getting some of that data out fast could be a pain at scale. a traditional SQL database might not cut it depending on the amount of analytics data you ingest. Not saying you should use Elasticsearch as a primary store but  it's a fantastic piece of software for BI.   You can even use kibana to create the dashboards for you.   Source : I just built a web analytics tracker on top of Elasticsearch with a NodeJS endpoint. It can query millions of events under a second.   For the front end if you're gonna be building charts,  D3 is awesome. Should play well with both react or Angular. #You could try giving Golang a shot for your API, it's not hard to get started with, and it's possible to put heavy processing tasks in ""Goroutines"", which are essentially threads that are easy to manage. It would also perform way better on CPU bound reports. #Hi,  So I'm a full stack dev and a part of my job involves creating and maintaining pages that generate and display reports to different types of account holders (some might be accounts with sub-accounts as well).  In my experience:  #DB  You don't need to make NoSQL and RDB an either-or case. You can use both in a complementary fashion.   # Backend   In the back-end domain, when comparing PHP vs Node.JS, the blocking I/O can really hurt you. Then on Node.JS, Hapi does come with more out of the box features and emphasizes configuration, but ExpressJS is fine. I was writing code for a resful api to access resources and my code ended up looking like what Hapi code actually looks like.  # Front-End  I recommend going with Vue.js.  - similar to but less verbose than React - will scale both up and down extremely well - from all the benchmarks I've seen (and this has been signed off by Dan Abramov), it performs faster than React.   If you find yourself still lacking speed you can just use Inferno, but I wouldn't until it's necessary.  Additionally D3.js for data visualization is a must. There is no true rival for it.  # Additional steps  If you find yourself drowning in requests, consider placing an nginx server between your clients and your servers.  If you find yourself with very slow calculations, don't be afraid to offload some processing client-side.#Im a full stack dev and work closely with the BI team at a an oil/gas company.  I would avoid PHP and JS (on the server) for this sort of thing and stick with a more structured system like python or (more preferably) move to .NET for something of this complexity.  As for DB, I suggest MsSQL because of its built-in data reporting services (SSRS).  There are all kinds of tutorials online and the system itself is great.  That said, we dont even use regular SQL to store BI data.  Instead, we use data cubes that store data in three dimensions as opposed to the standard 2.  It's a popular system for BI because you can have dimensions completely dedicated to time.  Because of that, its faster and easier to compare metrics to something from a year ago and see how far you've grown (keep in mind, the same could be accomplished with standard tables, it's just less efficient bc you need lookups)   You could also look into a BI specific language like R.   MSSQL server has an add-in for it, or you can do standalone implementation.  There are also things like SAS or Spotfire that help with analysis, but those have costs associated with them#I am also barely experienced, but here's my 2 cents.  Have you considered using GraphQL? Considering that you have multiple different clients hitting the database I think it would speed up your development process. It allows you to define the data you would like to receive through the client and saves you time on writing specific endpoints for each client you may be working with. The query language itself is pretty nice and using their GraphQL sandbox will allow you to pick it up incredibly quickly, however a good amount of time will be spent learning and configuring GraphQL to work with your RDBMS.  I'd definitely suggest NodeJS w/ExpressJS and GraphQL backend. I love React on the frontend w/ Redux. However, Redux is likely unnecessary since it seems you will be building a small application.   My background is full stack javascript so I can't really comment on other backend languages other than NodeJS. I also have no experience with worker processes so nothing to add there. "

I don't know how much that is true but I can say that we value candidates who know their way around code and we will often pick candidates who have experience with programming languages. I think it's mostly because data science tools are not quite there and still need a lot of human coding expertise to really get the data/models we want. Besides, someone who can do both is cheaper.#I would recommend you take a course in linear algebra. You don't need much pure math beyond linear, but knowing it will make certain  data-related topics easier and there will definitely be overlap if you plan on minoring in CS as well. #On the CS side a database class would be a great benefit for a lot of industrial data science positions.

I personally like to see single-major degrees.  I have a bachelors in a liberal arts field and if anything I've found it only helps on data science interviews.  If you don't end up getting the masters, a split bachelors won't really be enough for most data scientist jobs, but you'll still be qualified as a data engineer and could work your way into ""big data"" that way.  #Someone said, a data scientist is someone who is better at programming than a statistician, and better at statistics than a computer scientist.  Since you have a degree in compsci, go for statistics.  You will never be a ""real"" data scientist without proficient knowledge and experience in statistics. Otherwise, you'd be a good ""data engineer"" :)  Just my personal opinion. (I am in my grad program in statistics in Germany, btw)#I work for a data science consulting company (I'm an engineer) and we only hire PHDs. Our clients only hire PHDs. Some times you see people who where technical people who became data scientists, but they rarely really are good ones.  If you had some nice contributions to some of the apache products or something and went to conferences and hack-a-thons, then maybe, but every where I know about is looking for phds. #Personal opinion here: the technicalities of your undergraduate degree (major/minor, major/major) matter little. What matters is generally what you studied, the skills you acquired, the depth at which you studied, and the level of your degree.  I'd suggest a masters over additional time in undergrad, it's critical in the field to even be considered. I have just a bachelors and it excludes me from consideration in many jobs because I don't have a masters.   Huge talking points that will help with grad school and jobs: pursue side projects, keep up on research and trends in the field, participate in a lab and research, find an amazing grad program and get your masters there.   In general, your undergrad can be done at a decent quality school, but your grad degrees should be done at as good of a school as you can get into and afford. They, especially in the beginning of your career, become the basis of your professional reputation. Depending on the school, it can really help unlock doors for you.  #I'm also an undergrad asking myself similar questions. Honestly, I think your gpa might be too low for a good stats grad program. A lot of the good ones have an average applicant gpa ≥ 3.5  It might be better to go CS major and get to work right away. Then you can apply to grad schools in a few years with industry experience to compensate for a lower gpa.  If you choose to stay in undergrad for long enough to boost your gpa, that's a different story!  Based on what I've read and the conversations I've had with professionals and grad students, an undergrad stats education is nowhere near enough. You need a masters to even be a little bit competitive (w/o work experience)- there are phd's in the running for these jobs too.#MS Stats here. Go for the master's degree. A bachelor's in CS is actually a ton of programming experience compared to what most people in an MS Stats program enter with, and everything I learned in my bachelor's (I got a BA Math, but I took a few undergraduate stats classes) was jack shit compared to the level of education and challenge at the graduate level. Another bachelor's degree would be a waste of your time.   Granted, it sort of necessitates that you are already good at math and can grasp basic statistics. Do you have familiarity with basic statistics already?"

Before season 3, my highest level woman was a survivorWhen S3 started I got couple women as ladder rewards, but I also started only pulling women when I got a pull of wrestlemania or higher. When I finally got to summerslam tier my freebie (or pity pull. not sure what the first ones is called) was a summerslam Alexa Bliss.I've done the fusion chamber 5 times. I did 3 Wrestlemania Fusions. I got Trish, then Lita, then Trish again. Did a survivor fusion amd got Seth Rollins. Them Then I did my first Summerslam Fusion and got Asuka. I know it's not a big data sample, but it supports the idea that anything I get wreslemania or above will be a woman. I only get high level men from events and money in the bank.I know it's not the worst problem yo have, but thought I'd share the oddness.;Send some of that luck my way please and thank you!  For Males I have an UL Kendrick, EL Swagger (Got a $100 Google play gift card for Christmas so decided to get a couple of Elite Packs on Saturday), SSF Joe Pro, SS Event Jericho Pro, and WM Pro Paige and WM Pro Bayley for Females. #I'd kill for some females, I have 4 single SS females. This is holding me back from moving up to elite :(#Well my Female luck is all Bayley and Nia Jax. My WM freebie was Bayley after I had got 2 Bayley from MITB. After that my SS freebie was Bayley and the ladder reward was another SS Bayley. And after the maintenance I got Nia Jax SS and now I'm in Hardened I got Nia Jax HR the other day. #Just got a Summerslam Sasha Banks. I'm sorry to everyone having trouble with their women cards.#I'm in elite and since s3 have only pulled women. I've also only pulled 3 s3 cards (including pity pulls and freebies). Pulled SS carmella pro, alexa bliss again for a pro and nia jax for a pro. Also pulled wm divas as well. Only pulled 1 wm card that was male and that was day 1. Even my elite was becky.#I have the same problem. My last 5 KOTR's (made the playoffs in each one) I've gotten only one male and like six females. In won it all in Hardened tier the other day, got a Hardened Nia Jax and a SS Becky Lynch and then in the next one, I lost in the first round and got a SS Sasha Banks. Meanwhile half of my team can't even get a diva pro that's close to their level.#I currently have a single of half the female SS cards. I think I'm just missing 5 or 6, I keep getting them as kotr rewards or pulls. Luckily my freebie was Nia Jax for Hardened and I have a ssf Asuka to help. Would love a pro ss women.

Hadoop is relatively simple to scale out horizontally (more machines). You might achieve better performance with multiple mid-range systems, than 1 single high-end system.  NVMe drives will be a good investment as the basis for what you deploy your HDFS on.   Don't work from spinning HDDs. They should act as storage only. HDDs are really bad at random and parallel access. SSDs are great at random access and NVMe are particularly good are parallel access on top of that.  If you're caught between multiple CPU choices, you'd want the want that has the highest **multithreaded score**, that's affordable to you.  Try with a single 1080 first and see how that pans out.

One other question I have is when buying a custom pc for the first time, is it better to buy all the parts and build yourself? or rather use a website that builds it for you and sends it? I'd be comfortable putting everything together, but the one thing that would worry me is applying the cooling system to the CPU. I've heard you have to watch out for air-pockets, and a whole sort of different things when applying it that could end up destroying the cpu if not applied correctly. Any reccomendations on that?#http://www.slideshare.net/PetteriTeikariPhD/deep-learning-workstation#Not entirely sure about this, but would you be opposed to buying one Titan XP instead of two 1080s?

For those who don't know who Slalom is, we have ~4500 employees in 25 offices in the US, Canada and the UK. We are more than just a technical consulting company, we have 7 different practices here in Denver including standard management consulting, delivery leadership, big data, software engineering, design, etc. We're privately held, never grow through acquisition, and try to live up to our core values (which haven't changed and are actionable (https://www.slalom.com/core-values). We have a local model where our consultants live and work in their home market. We have a few travelers, but that is by choice not by definition. We have roughly 175 people in the denver office across all of the practices. In the technology space, we're tech agnostic. We have partnerships with most of the big players (our big 4 are aws, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Tableau) but they don't dictate to us nor do we push their products unless it's what's right (see core value #1). I'm working at a client that's fully in the IBM stack for example. We align our technical folks along the tech they like, and don't ask them to be a generalist (unless they like to be). This means if you're an ios dev, we're not going to ask you to write java or c# code. That just doesn't make sense does it? Right now, we have a pretty pressing need for a large number of people as we head into 2017.  We'll be hiring throughout the year, so if the time isn't right, don't hesitate to reach out. In a nutshell, here's what our current needs look like:- full stack engineers Some sort of Javascript framework (preference to angular or react), c# or Java backend, node/go/Python is acceptable too depending on level/balance. Multiple positions, 1-2 years of experience to architect - front end engineerstypically angular 1.x right now, obviously react is big tooWe need 2-5 engineers, from 1-2 years experience to architect. - Java engineersWe need an architect level fullish stack Java engineer,  and a couple strong junior to mid level engineers. Services mostly, rarely jsp type work. - c# engineers We need a couple junior to mid level c# engineers. Services, mvc, sorry no webforms or vb. - AWS engineers/architects We need 3-5 people ranging from 1-2 years experience to well seasoned architects. Bonus points for automation/devops, especially on the application build side, not just the IaaS side. PaaS side also very helpful. We have massive backing by aws in the market so these are key roles (again, tech agnostic, but we're seeing very, very heavy volume from clients to rearchitect their applications to take advantage of the cloud) - practice leadership It's very hard to hire us. Basically we're going to look for folks who have lead other consulting practices or owned an agency/consulting company. You must be the right mix of business, relationship, and technical - again, hard to find. We normally grow from within (and are), but having external leaders come in (like I did) from time to time can be a great boost. If you don't feel like you fit into any of the above ""buckets"" no sweat. We love diversity (in all the senses), so reach out. Definitions like the above are there to help center people. If you're interested, shoot me a pm and we'll go from there. A few important notes:- sorry, no recruiters - if you're from out of town, great! You will need to, during the interview process, come to Denver for an in person interview- we also don't offer relocation as a general rule. Since I (and an employeee who worked for me in Dallas went through this last year, I can help walk you through it). - our interview process is a little lengthy. Our biggest asset is our people, and we get great clients who ask us back because of our ability to deliver and our great people. We need to make sure that the individuals we hire fit our culture. - if you you have no work experience in any of the above, and this includes going through a boot camp (galvanize, etc), sorry you won't be a great fit. Honestly we're not setup organizationally (yet) to support zero experience analysts. ";Ooh, I'm looking for a junior(ish) C# dev position in the Front Range area.

That question isn't going anywhere. #No, the last time I've head the industry standard is going to be changed to 100 observations per model with a huge fine should you use more data #It's still one of the fastest growing fields and if history tells us, its only going to be in more demand since the data we produce is expanding at an exponential rate (think IoT devices).

GradSchool;5joke0;1482380103.0;/r/GradSchool/comments/5joke0/would_i_qualifybe_ready_for_a_masters_in/;Would I qualify/be ready for a Masters in Statistics;Hello guys,I'm looking for some opinions on whether or not I'd qualify for a Graduate program in Statistics. To give a little background, my bachelors is in interactive media art and engineering. I initially came at it from the B.A. side, focusing on UX design and 2d/3d graphics. However, there was the option to come at it from the B.S. side of things in computer science. Over the last 2 years I began taking more cs and math courses. While it's impractical to transition over to the cs degree at this point, by the time I graduate I will have taken cs coursework in Algorithms and Data Structures, Discrete Math, Object Oriented Programming, Probability and Statistics Engineering, Software Engineering and Calc I - III. I did this partly because I was worried about job security and also because I wasn't dead-set on a single field and wanted to have more transferable skills. I don't plan to apply for graduate school immediately. I want to narrow down my interest - I rushed into college without much self-reflection. But of the Masters degree's that I've considered the only one that ever really stood out was a Masters in Statistics. Marketing Analytics, Big Data and Data Science all sound up my alley. Regardless, would the background I have in Computer Science and Math be enough to get me in the door at a grad school, or would I be too far behind for it to be practical?I'd also like to hear from any people who went the Statistics route and what you've worked on both in and out of the classroom.Thanks for any info!;Have you taken a linear algebra class? Some proof-y math classes may help you as well, but it sounds like your interests lie more in applied statistics.#If you're going for an MS in Statistics rather than an MS in Applied Statistics, you should at least have Calc I-III (needed for Mathematical Statistics theory) and Linear Algebra (needed for regression). I really wish I'd taken more Linear Algebra with how often it comes up in upper level classes. Differential equations would be useful for Poisson proof. Also, if you can take a 400 level Stat class, such as Intro to Math Stats, you'll be much more prepared for the Mathematical Statistics theory classes you usually get in your first year.#I guess it depends on the program, but I think you have a good chance. (Source: am first year master's student in statistics. I came from a B.S. in psychology. This semester was rough for multiple reasons and I wish I would've done a few things differently, but professors generally consider me a good student. If I could scrape through, so can you. Just don't try to take too many credits at once--there should be no need to anyway.)
Surface;5gtpos;1481041010.0;/r/Surface/comments/5gtpos/sp4_vs_sb/;SP4 vs SB;Hi everyone. I've been using a S3 (2gb version) for about a year and a half now as my primary computer and most of the time it works great. The issue I run into is that I just do not have enough power. I work as a research analyst and although sometimes the work is simple enough for the S3 to handle, there have been plenty of times that I need to wait until I'm at work to use my desktop (8gb ram) to do anything because the load is just to big. So I'm considering getting a S4 or SB as my new primary computer. I don't need it immediately, but in the next year or so I anticipate buying one. So what do you guys think? Is the SB overkill or statistical modeling and analysis with big data sets? Would the extra power be worth it? Or will the SP4 be good enough? Also, is the SB worth the price increase over the SP4 in general? ;To me it basically comes down to if you need the additional graphics power that the Surface Book has. Everything else is pretty much shared between the two of them.#I am also a  research analyst  and also just upgraded from the Surface 3 2gb model to the M3 for work .  I think the surfacebook is overkill for the work we do but at the same time, I think it has a better form factor then the surface pro 4.   #You will most likely find the performance of the SP4 to be enough for that kind of modelling (I do with my old SP3).  I think it comes down to what kind of use and versatility you want in a device really. SP is closer to a tablet (or pretty much a beefed up version of your current device) while SB is closer to a laptop.  While I was a student SP was perfect since I was more mobile, now that I sit in an office or travel in work I'd rather go for the SB. #They're pretty much the same computer except one has a slightly better dedicated video card. If your workload is CPU bound then the Surface Book would not give you any extra performance. In fact, the SP4 would provide a much better value, for example:  ---  SP4 - i7 16GB 256GB is only $1600  versus  SB - i5 8GB 256GB dGPU is $1649  ---  So unless you need the dGPU then other factors might be more important, battery life, keyboard, display size, lapability, tablet hinge, etc. It's more of a personal choice.  Keep in mind the dGPU in the SB isn't really seamless like a desktop PC. By default applications use the intel video chip unless you specifically configure a specific application to use the nvidia card. You cannot detach the display if an app is running and configured to use the nvidia chip (it will prompt you to shut down the app). So 90% of the time, I'm using the onboard Intel chip even in drawing programs.#The easiest way to decide I feel is this:  Do you need the extra power dGPU?  * If yes, then get the SB  If no, then we'll go to the next question:  Do you prefer a tablet first or laptop first experience? Ie. would you take advantage of a tablet form factor more or a laptop form factor more?  * If laptop first, then the SB * If tablet first, then the SP4#I don't have that kind of workload to do on a SP3, but I'm waiting for the SP5.  If you can wait a year or so, I imagine a version of the SP5 with enough ram and the new intel processors that could probably handle a fair bit of processing requirements.#Even if you don't need the extra power of the surfacebook GPU, consider the much longer battery life. realistic best case scenario on sp4 is 5-6 hours, on surfacebook it is literally 10-12 hrs... I've flip flopped back and forth between SB and SP4 too many times now, right now I'm on the SurfaceBook, and I definitely enjoy not being OCD about the charge level of my device, I can literally wait 2-3 days before worrying about charging the SurfaceBook, since my usage model is 2-3 hours a day on the machine. (This might be different if you use the detached clipboard mode a lot though as clipboard runs out of battery fairly quickly if it is off the base)#Performance wise, unless you use CUDA enabled applications where the GPU would give you a performance benefit, the SB and SP4 are pretty much identical in terms of performance. Choose the device that makes the most sense for your workflow. Do you want a tablet that can also function as a laptop, or do you want a laptop that can work as a tablet?

I'm headed to medical school next year, so that's not much help for you. Something that has become very clear to me is people in bioethics tend to have other qualifications like being MDs, JDs, PhDs, etc. and bioethics is something they do through their lens. Have you considered law? There's a lot of work on regulation and policy development to be done on big data in the coming years, and a law degree would set you up nicely to do that work.

It's a bit of a fashion term, and given a lot of interpretations nowadays, but it used to mean doing advanced operations (like machine learning) on datasets of millions or even more objects. That does not sound at all like what you are doing.  From what I get is that you want to import lines from a text file of about 200 000 lines to MySQL with a PHP script. In that case: go for it, PHP will suit you fine. If you want to do machine learning, data mining or similair, PHP might not be the best language. In that case I prefer python, where it provides a lot of good libraries for that kind of processing. But of course there are more options.  Maybe you can explain in greater detail what you exactly are trying to achieve?#I don't want to burst a bubble but the number of rows, 10mil, does not necessarily define 'big data' but more the complexity and variety of data. When we get past the sales horse crap, it's really about trying to take disparate data points and bring them together to production actionable bits of information.   If you already have well structured data want to find/update or just aggregate, a well indexed database in just about any modern rdbms will give you want you want in most scenarios.  As for intaking large files and inserting them into a db, streams.#You should continue to use MySQL, or PostgreSQL, as both have now sharding solutions in case your data become really big. Simply use SQL and proper indexes.#Big data is defined by the 5 Vs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data#Characteristics #you still need more data to define your work ""big data""#You need to embrace the paradigm shift and become a result-driven bigdata devop who leverages the synergy between machine learning and the cloud towards predictive analysis, in a disruptive way.

bigdata;5gek6w;1480839903.0;/r/bigdata/comments/5gek6w/building_a_new_bigdataweb_crawling_pipeline/;Building a new BigData/web crawling pipeline question;"Hi,My team is working on a new project, moving an existing BigData-ish/web crawling pipeline to the cloud - Microsoft Azure, in this case.The data size is Big Data-ish - technically we can store it on a single machine, but we need more processing power than a single machine can handle.Also, the input data are actually Web pages - we keep processing new versions of the same page, the data doesn't accumulate, but it gets updated - something that is not often found in Big Data processing.I am familiar with the ""classic"" map-reduce/Hadoop pipelines, mostly for processing log files and similar types of data.I inherited a design/code from someone, who started the project. This design is built around workflows - not at high level - starting MR batches, but at low level - the workflows are executed during the processing of the individual sites/pages.There is a custom workflow engine built, that can handle ""blocked"" state, external dependencies and so on.As I said, I am familiar with how to address the problem, using a ""classic"" MR solution, that ""moves"" data from one processing state to another.My concern with this workflow based system is that the performance will suffer, but it's hard to compare apples to apples. It's been a while since I worked on a system like this, I want to make sure I am not missing any new developments in the area  at the same time, the previous engineer may just got it wrong.Any comments? Does anyone have experience with a similar system? As I mentioned, the amount of data / pages we are processing, is not that big - maybe about 20 million pages every 3 weeks.At this volume, probably many different approaches will work. My concern is about to making the best design choice, if we have to process 10-20 times this volume, for example. Thank you for reading this and for your feedback in advance.Simon";"It's not really clear where you see potential issues. You fear that your ""workflow engine"" is not flexible enough and introduce latency for some reason?  In that case you should give a look to Luigi or Airflow.#[deleted]#You may be interested in Pachyderm as a way of of implementing this. Unlike other systems it's got version control for the data built into it so it's very good for workloads where there are smaller incremental changes to the data. In this cases processing is automatically done incrementally as well. It also has support for deploying directly on Azure and storing data in their object storage so it should be fairly simple to get going with if that's your cloud of choice.  DM if you'd like more details. I'm the creator of it."

I am finishing in Spain a short of mechanical engineering (my bachelor is more generalistic though) and there are a few fields I would like to work in, and one is the IT field because there are a lot of jobs and it's easier to promote if you are capable to learn new things and adapt your self. I like making MOOCs so there won't be a problem. I will be making an Erasmus in Netherlands the next semester and I have made courses about SQL, VBA, Supply Chain so it can prove my eagerness for learning new things.  The point is: if I dont have a computer science degree, would I be able to get a good career in IT? I would like to work on big data or in a product company (videogames, engineering sofwtare or even Amazon), but not on consulting. Are there companys that have as a necessary requesite having a CS degree or usually it's enough to demonstrate that you have acquired knowledge for example making MOOCs?In addition, I am willing to work all around Europe. Thank you very much for your help. Have a nice day;"As long as you are able to do the job you are applying for, you won't have an issue.  It probably will be a little harder to get an interview compared to someone the employer knows for a fact was exposed to x, y and z thru their CS degree; compared to you where they need to think about if your resume makes sense, do you have the experience they need.#Apply at SPX Flow (and maybe SPX Corp). In fact, feel free to PM me when you're ready, or even today so we can connect on LinkedIn.  I chose not to finish college, but I was going for mechanical engineering. Now I use SQL, I could use better VBA skills, and I'm not sure what Supply Chain with capital letters is, but we definitely have a lot of supply chain concerns to manage.  There is a whole category of software called ERP (enterprise resource planning). We use SAP. You will be extremely valuable to engineering companies and others that use ERP software integrated with other software.  I'm sure there are other avenues for you to take, but you can be confident there will be a place for you somewhere.#It all comes down to how you apply yourself and learn and grow professionally.  I know many with worthless Bachelors degrees that are highly successful in IT (IE Art, Women's Studies, etc) because of how they apply themselves.  While your degree isn't IT per se, it's a respected degree.   Get out there and apply yourself and you'll be very successful in IT.#Thank you very much for your answers!"

Behind Alexander Nix, the logo of Cambridge Analytica appears - a brain composed of a few network nodes like one Map. ""A few months ago, Cruz was still one of the less popular candidates,"" says the blonde man with this British tongue, which makes Americans feel like many Swiss Germans, ""only 40 percent of the voters knew his name."" Flash rise of conservative Senator Cruz. It was one of the strangest moments of the election campaign. Trumps, the last great opponent of the party, had come out of nowhere. ""How did he do that?"" Nix continues. By the end of 2014, Cambridge Analytica had entered the US campaign, initially as a consultant to the Republican Ted Cruz, financed by the secret US software billionaire Robert Mercer.   .   > At this time, in early 2014, a young assistant professor named Aleksandr Kogan joined Kosinski. He had a question from a company interested in Kosinskis method. The Facebook profiles of ten million US users should be measured psychometrically. For what purpose, he could not say that there were strict secrecy requirements. Kosinski wants to say first, it is about a lot of money for his institute, but then hesitates. Finally, Kogan emerges with the name of the company: SCL - Strategic Communications Laboratories. Kosinski goes to the company: ""We are a globally operating choice management agency,"" he reads on the company website. SCL offer marketing based on a psychological model. Focus: Choice of influence. Election control? Disturbed to Kosinski click through the pages. What kind of company is it? And what do they have in the US?  >What Kosinski does not know at this time: Behind SCL is a complex corporate design with taxpayers - as the Panama Papers and Wikileaks revelations show. Some have contributed to the turmoil in developing countries, while others have developed methods for the psychological manipulation of the population in Afghanistan. And now, SCL is also the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, the ominous big-data booth that organized the online election campaign for Trump and Brexit.  >Kosinski does not know anything about it, but he does not know what is wrong. ""The matter began to stink,"" he recalls. In his research, he discovers that Aleksandr Kogan has secretly registered a company that does business with SCL. From a document, which is available to the magazine, it is clear that SCL was acquainted with Kosinskis method by Kogan. Suddenly Kosinski dawned that Kogan might have copied or rebuilt his Ocean model to sell it to the electoral control company. Immediately he breaks the contact to him and informs the institute leader. Within the university, a complicated conflict is developing. The institute is concerned about its reputation. Aleksandr Kogan first moves to Singapore, gets married and calls himself Dr. Specter. Michal Kosinski moves to Stanford University in the USA.  >For a year, it is quite quiet, then, in November 2015, the more radical of the two Brexit campaigns, ""leave.eu"", sponsored by Nigel Farage, announced that she had commissioned a big data company to support her election campaign online: Cambridge Analytica. Core competency of the company: novel political marketing, so-called microtargeting - based on the psychological ocean model.  >Kosinski gets mails, what he has to do with it - with the keywords Cambridge, Ocean and Analytics many think of him first. For the first time he hears the company. He looks horrified at the site. His nightmare has come true: his methodology is used on a grand scale for political purposes.   > After the Brexit in July, insults bellow at him: Just look what you have done, write friends and acquaintances.

There are a lot of quacks who claim to have magical medical equipment, and you don't want to kill people over misdiagnosis.  If you do misdiagnose, who can be sued?  It's an important consideration with medical equipment, and tends to drive up the price.  Good luck to you.#http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/510kClearances/#I'm a doctor. Pm me#On a different note, do you personally have experience with coding for machine learning? How do you plan on actually making the product? I ask because im wanting to do something (slightly) similar but have no clue of how to actually make the product since my experience is in business analysis not coding.#Most likely medical institutions.   AI should help them cut costs and improve diagnosis.   For instance TC published a startup that could notice signs of cancer in lungs(I guess) with CT scan at higher than doctor precision rate.   So hospitals for instance could save on doctors hours and get a higher rate of diagnosis.   I would love to learn what you have found during your PhD. 
Entrepreneur;5h48ba;1481162827.0;/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5h48ba/starting_a_healthcare_data_analytics_firm_as_a/;Starting a healthcare data analytics firm as a medical student?;**TL DR** - Medical student with rudimentary stats and CS knowledge wanting to start a healthcare big-data analytics company. Networking not a problem, but who do I talk to and how do I start?**Long-version**I'm a first-year medical student (BS in biomedical engineering). I have programming experience but nothing at the level of a CS graduate (i.e. I know how to code but don't know the more advanced CS concepts like graph theory, combinatorics, etc). My statistics knowledge is also rudimentary, and nothing at the level of a statistics grad either. That being said, I'm very interested in data analytics and am willing to learn if needed.I want to start a company that provides big-data analytic services to the hospital system affiliated with my medical school. I have a general goal of what I want to accomplish (applying predictive analytics to healthcare/medical record info to identify at-risk patients and reduce readmission rates). However, I have no idea how to even start with all this.As a medical student, I can network with virtually anyone in my hospital system, so that would not be a problem. How would I even begin to approach this? Am I foolish even for thinking about this business given my relative lack of knowledge?;"Hey there!  I run a healthcare data analytics company.  We use AI to review patient comments and tell hospitals how to improve  patient experience.  Here is what I've seen:  Starting a company like this has a chicken and the egg problem:  to create your solution and test it, you need data. Hospitals are very cautious about to whom the provide data.    I would talk to someone in the innovation department about your idea and if they would give you a de-identified data set that you could use to devise an early prototype.  My guess is you need a clear plan of what you plan to analyze, how you plan to do it, and what they may get out of it in exchange for using their data.  Then do the analysis by hand.  Build nothing.  Then you'll know if you are onto something that may be a product one day.#I applaud you going to medical school and trying to start an informatics company. Very hard to do. There are a lot of companies in the space right now as hospitals and health systems try to reduce costs. Take a look at what McKesson, Epic or Cerner are offering and see if you can do better.#Since more and more hospital reimbursement is being tied to performance and quality metrics (readmission rates being one metric that's often benchmarked), I'd guess that most large hospital systems already have some sort of program in place; I'd do a bit of digging to see if there's a team in place that you can collaborate with.    If so it would be a good starting point to see what tools are being used in the space, and get a better understanding of how you might go out on your own in the future. "

That's just a guess though, but I feel like I see this same exact question every month.  You should check the resources of this sub, I'm almost positive that your answer is there.#i've been using robinhood (commission free) to invest in stocks. Recently, they also introduced Gold plan where they lend you some money like $3000 that you can use to invest and keep all the profits. #I use Merrill Edge, Robinhood and Motif. I use ME because you get 30 free trades a month with a balance > 25k. I use Robinhood because it has free trades (also has less features). I use Motif because I can buy 30 stocks at a time for $10#I use CapitalOne Investing (formerly Sharebuilder). They're fine... #Take a look at Interactive Brokers#We were Scottrade customers but transferred our accounts to Schwab after it was announced that Scottrade was being acquired by TD Ameritrade. Schwab was offering a deal to Scottrade customers who transfer accounts to them - commission free trades for as long as you had your Scottrade account. They also pay the transfer fee. It's unbelievable. We did it and it works as they said. We'll get at least 10 years of commission free trades and after that it will be $6.95 per trade. Schwab has a lot of other advantages like free checks, ATM fee reimbursement, no foreign transaction fees. We've always found their customer service to be excellent. I'm not sure how long their Scottrade deal will last.
learnpython;5hp0ff;1481441031.0;/r/learnpython/comments/5hp0ff/what_would_you_consider_to_be_the_different/;"What would you consider to be the different ""levels"" of programming?";"I have been working away at learning Python for about 3 weeks now, and I can't help but wonder how far I have come, and also how to judge at what point I would be able to say that I program things rather than just mess with code until it works. I'm really interested in big data, and particularly machine learning, I really hope to get into machine learning, and eventually hope to start playing around with HMM. One thing I have wondered is, what are the different ""levels"" of programmers? For example, out of say 100 programmers picked at random, what would the typical abilities be? What are some problems that are intermediate difficulty? When you can understand to do ________ you are proficient enough to get a job programming. I know there isn't any one single thing that answers everything, but as someone hoping to start looking into job options involving programming, what should I be able to do before even considering looking for jobs or freelance projects? ";"That's a hard question, probably one that doesn't have an answer. There's just too much variety and variation. For example, programmer A may have a more thorough understanding of different types of search-algorithms than programmer B, but B may have a better understanding of Python's urllib module. Which one is ""better""? I don't think the question has an answer, especially when you consider this question could be asked about a million different things.   All you can say, in my view, is that for any domain you are  either an expert in it or not, intermediate or not, beginner or not. So in that sense you get levels of skill *for some specific domain*. But when you ask about a general level, which encompasses multiple domains of knowledge, then you are asking a hard question.   Perhaps an analogy of sorts helps. So, I come from a linguistics background, and you would never say linguist A is better than linguist B. Simply because most linguists work on different problems, in different domains, with different skillsets. One may be an expert on German syntax; another may be an expert on truth-conditional semantics; another may be an expert on Chinese morphology... And each of them are brilliant at what they do. But it becomes impossible to quantify in any meaningful sense what levels each is at relative to the other. You get the picture.  So pick some domains that interest you. If you are interested in the web, then pick those that will help you get a web job. So, for example, Python's urllib module, or the Django framework, and become as good as you can in them. #> what should I be able to do before even considering looking for jobs or freelance projects?  Learning. All other stuff is just a matter of time if you can learn things.#My experience (1 year of programming, consistently): 1) Tough 6 months of just learning syntax 2) Implementing syntax, and learning about modules.  My 2-cents: I have the same general sort-of-goal, with data-collection and machine-learning/big-data.  I even, naively, searched jobs with those options in-mind. I have no clue, what you should ""do""/""know"" to land jobs; but I do think what you should be asking (as I wish I should have) is: how long will I have to study, until I become competent in said-job. #> When you can understand to do ________ you are proficient enough to get a job programming  Are your projects in version control and do you understand why that's important? There's more to the job than that, but that's the thing I most frequently see being put off 'until we have something to store there'.#http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/"

I'm a DBA/analytics guy, worked for current company for about 3 years, but was an independent developer before that for nearly 20 years. My employer got bought by a competitor and they terminated all of the IT positions in our office, preferring to keep them in the home office. My last day was Weds. Literally on my last day with the company, a director of the data department at the company that bought us contacted me and said that he heard I was really good and would I be interested in interviewing for an ETL specialist/data warehouse architect and engineering position, morphing into data science in a year or two when the warehouse is more stable. I've done two interviews with that team already. Let's call this option #1. Option #2 is a job offer from a management consultant I respect a lot that I worked with about 10 years ago, building a big executive information system for tracking assets on large construction projects. It's white-page development that starts small but should include big data, IoT processing, a bunch of fun stuff.  Let's call that option #2. Option #1: * Pros: Big company, big data, big resources, lots of budget for tools, a few other experts working on parts of the systems. 34 billion row tables, budget for cloud processing, etc. It's healthcare, so it's a rich data environment with the possibility to really make differences in people's care. * Cons: I hear dark rumors of epidemic bureaucratic entanglements, favoritism, constant organizational reshuffling,  arbitrary deadlines, your typical 1000+ company organizational problems. The pace is very fast. The org is very heavily siloed, more like castles. I haven't met her but the big boss is supposedly a straight-up genius, but very mercurial and hard to work with and sometimes yells a lot. Interviewers told me that I would be mostly on my own because nobody upstairs has any time to deal with me and everybody lower than me can't be trusted to do anything not 110% specified in detail. (H1b workers...)Option #2:* Pros: New programming technology, new languages, would be building a system from scratch with complete control over the product, working with a small team and a manager I deeply respect. It's a cool client in an industry I want to know more. Stress level is likely much, much lower than Option #1, and my friend has always been a very rational person to work for. Pays about 40% more than Option #1, but as a contractor. (I have a corporation). I'll be working for myself again, which I usually enjoy.* Cons: Will only be a 6 month contract to start. May extend another 6 after that but we will have to show big gains to get it. Initial programming is web UI using Google Polymer, which I don't know but can certainly learn, but I'm trying to get away from doing UI work, though this should only be for the first phase. I would likely be doing initial architecture on every step of the data system and I'm only a newb on a bunch of this big data tech. So less stress, but a lot more school time (on my own dime). Both:* Neutral: I would likely work from home for at least 6 months with either job. Option #2 will likely be at home forever, Option #1 will likely require relocation after the initial period. I feel like I have a week to decide one way or the other, though neither job offer is 100% in hand yet, I'm 99% sure I will get an offer for each in the next 7 days. So my question: What kinds of things should I be asking myself to help decide between the two offers? Wow, you made it this far. Insight?;Reading your post it sounds like you have answered your own question.   Take the job that will build your resume. Working for yourself gives you more freedom to finally move forward in your career.  The market is ever changing, time to invest in yourself. Option 2 has you excited, yes it is uncertain, yes you will have to invest a little, but you are investing in yourself. A great reminder to never get too comfortable. # i think questions to ask are:  if you chose option 1, are you ready to deal with the politics and new company policies and work environment.  Seems like you are qualified for this role, if youve done 2 interviews, and you know the systems / type of work already.  if you chose option 2, the pay is more because it is a contract which is expected.  are you confident in getting another job with your skill set after 6 months?  I wouldn't really bank on the 6 month extension because its not guaranteed, and you can evaluate it close to that time. you may not be fully qualified for this role if you need to learn something new and then build a system/environment from scratch.  Generally, contractors are hired for their tech skills and they should come into work with the skills needed, not to learn on the job. If this company is ok with you still learning the tech, then perhaps you could take advantage of the contract role.  if it was upto me, I would stick with Option 1, try the ETL role, get some experience in it, if you like it, stay, if not then apply elsewhere with your newly gained experience and skillset.  I would not take a contract role involving tech that i was not atleast intermediate in.#Age and retirement savings factors how?

I am finishing Kings C book Second Ed and will be looking to expand further.What I am looking to do is...well, anything. Big Data, Machine Learning, NN, HPC/Parallel/GPU, Numerical and mathematical programming and optimization, you name it! GUI, CV, human 2 computer interaction, combinatorics and statistical analysis. Just to name an extra few.What seems to get me is the lack of C resources available online (when it comes to written text.[Yes, I have seen this list.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/562303/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list)) There seems to be very few books or modern books concerning the above disciplines. I was either thinking:1.) Asking C veterans what they recommend for books on the above. Provided they are as modern as needed. 2.) Asking Programming veterans of all types if I should continue C or if I should jump to a new language and have C as a catalyst for anything needing to be used for memory and performance optimization. C++ and Python comes to mind, but I am open.Before I close, I would like to state that reading r/learnprogramming has shown that there are many here self-teaching themselves. I am looking to do CS and some math later on, but now would like to spend on learning programming. As to my specific goals, that I have not determined as I have NOT been exposed to much of the CS discipline and cannot make a decision as of now. So, I do apologize for being terse or vague in my post.;Once you finish King's book, you should know C well enough to program in it.  If you are unfamiliar with data structures and algorithms, then that should be what you learn next.  Data structures and algorithms are the tools that form the foundation of programs.  I don't have any specific resource to recommend, but look for one that has programming exercises and at least covers linked lists, binary trees, hash tables, and sorting.  After that, you should have the necessary knowledge to build non-trivial programs.  You could then utilize outside libraries to make interesting things, like [sdl](https://www.libsdl.org) if you want to make games, [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se) for doing stuff with the Internet, [gsl](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) for math, one of the many gui libraries, etc.#Hey, most of the stuff you listed makes it seem like you have an interest in AI.

This program is fairly basic, Consists of 1 compulsory research course and 6 other optional CS courses... On the other we have BDA, Which is a new honors program started at my university (of which they say acceptance is highly selective). This program seems really cool as it aims to bring together some interesting areas of CS and Math, such as Machine Learning, optimization and multivariate statistics... It's a much more structured program than its CS counter part  Consisting of 5 compulsory courses and 2 optional courses...As a new graduate, who hasn't had much experience in the real world outside of google...

Failed Calc 1 (I've always been bad at math/really uninterested in the subject, and my shitty/small mistakes cost me the course - yes it was a requirement for my major) and my *""intro""* to programming class (how abjectly awful this course was is a story for another day), and passed my micro-econ and bio classes. Aside from me being 100% despondent currently, got me thinking about CS and if it's the right career path.I loved my job. I loved the software (Dynamic CRM, VS) and the languages (VB, SQL) and really liked the concepts that my econ teacher went over this year. After this course, don't know how much I'm interested in ""true"" computer science (figuring the solutions out from scratch) rather than the information I'd rather be managing and making reports on that while using the code to assist in giving me the data I'd need.

I’m a long time lurker but first time poster. The reason I finally decided to post is that I want a change in my life and I really need your advice and thoughts. I’m a 35-year-old male from India who came to the United States on a green card right after my undergrad.  I got admission in a big research university in Electrical Engineering but unfortunately I just could never click and dropped out. I also isolated myself from everyone else and pretty much was holed up in my room. I ended up using almost 4 years to conclude that I wasn’t good for school and that I need to drop out. In that whole time period, I actually finished all the required courses but the thesis requirement.  After dropping out I went and settled with my aunt’s for few months and took a job at a retail store (during the 2008-09 economic crisis). I didn’t have any confidence or self esteem to muster out of my comfort zone. So I kept on going to the retail job. Finally after almost a year and a half I decided enough is enough and I need to finish my grad school. I enrolled in a local state university and started attending the classes. After first semester, I started getting the same feelings of hopelessness and fear. I felt like this wasn’t for me and my interest in Electrical engineering was weaning. I persevered and finished the grad school in two years but was totally exhausted and felt that I didn’t deserve anything in life. That my life, my money, anything I had to offer was useless. I didn’t even make my professional resume for job hunting after graduating let alone look for or apply for one. I kept on going to the same retail job after graduating and continued until one of my family friends got me a job as a QA in a local software company. I did the job for six months but never felt any passion or motivation to learn QA stuff.  On the weekends I would lose my mind and wouldn’t know what to do with myself. So after six months I again joined the same retail job. After almost 3 years since grad school I started getting suicidal thoughts and for the first time realized that I need to go see therapist. I have been attending therapy once per week since May 2016. I was finally diagnosed with Deep depression. According to my therapist, this depression kicked off when I first came here to the United States. I also showed the symptoms of dysthymia and I probably had it since high school or freshman year undergrad. My therapist suggested that I see a psychiatrist for medication. I have been taking medication for almost a month. But just to think about that I actually blew up almost 11 years of my life to finally get some help is just mind boggling to me. Now that I’m actually working towards getting mentally fit, I wonder what can I do to actually get back on track career and life wise. I have no relevant experience in the field of EE and don’t even know if I really want to pursue it anymore. I need your advice on how to go about it. I have no social contact (friends and limited family) in my life to bounce around ideas. So I’m really confused about the future prospects. In the past year and a half I have self-studied (no certifications) to get infrastructure architect positions. I also took a 2 months long Big-data course through an Indian “consultancy” in the bay area. As of now I’m completely clueless. So any advice, suggestions, mentorship would really lift up my moral and be great help. Thanks in advance. TL DR: I came to the US for grad school on a green card. Messed up a lot of things, didn’t make sound decisions on time. Dropped out of one school and ended up finishing from another school. Got diagnosed with deep depression and dysthymia after almost 11 years. Need advice, suggestions to get back on track career/job/life wise. No real experience just the retail experience and school degree in Electrical engineering.;I'm really sorry to hear what you went through, but I'm also really happy for you that you're getting things back on track!  Looking for a direction is the best thing you can do right now.  What do you like to do as a hobby?  To be 100% honest, companies like to see that you have a degree, and singe you do have a degree in an advanced field you can most likely land a job in any field you're interested in - provided, of course, that it doesn't require any specifically advanced degrees.  I can't say that I'm an expert, by any means, but I would totally suggest that you search around, and apply for jobs that you're interested in - even if you don't feel qualified.. Most jobs sound more difficult on paper and (almost) every company has training!  I truly hope you find what you're looking for - please keep us updated here as you continue on your journey!#Hey, sorry to hear that it took so long for you to seek help but I'm glad that you were able to do so.  To keep my answer short, I think a good fit for you to consider might be engineering sales.  For engineering sales, you need to have some technical background (which you have) as well as a bit of sales/communication skills.  It sounds like you are interested in the sales part due to you repeatedly going back to retail.  This kind of position could also help you to be more sociable which may help in your personal life (getting more friends).  Also, these jobs are typically easy to get as they are not classic engineering jobs (design, testing, validation, etc).  Might be worth looking into!#Thank you so much! I'm taking baby steps for now. Just posting on reddit and letting someone else know about my situation was a huge deal for me. I actually got a Meyers-Briggs evaluation and SI evaluation. But not sure what to do with it. I think i need to push little bit every time (one step at a time)   I thought about the Engineering sales jobs. I'll explore more about them. Also, i have finished non paid MOOCs here and there but not sure what to do with them.   Thank you guys for reading this and giving me some suggestions. I really appreciate it.

My understanding is ""Kolsinki created an app with a classmate that was at the time as straightforward as Facebook."" Certainly this isn't right, though. Is ""ins damals"" an expression? Thanks for any help!";No, 'ins' is contracted 'in das' and 'in Facebook stellen' means 'to put on Facebook'. Personally I think the expression sounds slightly odd....I'd say 'auf Facebook stellen'. However, 'to put on the internet' *is* expressed as 'ins Internet stellen', so maybe whoever wrote this actually had the internet in mind.

I will soon be taking my first job out of school doing full-stack development in Java with Angular or React on the front end. I suppose this will start to help me with the breadth aspect, but i'm not sure how or where I want to go deep.Machine learning and big data stuff seem interesting to me. Also, I enjoy working though the DS&A problems on leetcode that everyone uses for interview prep, and wouldn't mind working in a job where I actually used those sorts of things. People who are in these sorts of jobs: what do you do? How did you get there?**TL DR:** How did you figure out what you wanted to do when you grow up, and how did you break into it?";I didn't.  I haven't specialised in any way and I haven't really decided on a set career, and don't really feel a need to. That has definitely impacted on my earnings and I am probably missing some depth of knowledge, but I have benefited in terms of general job and life enjoyment and have learned things I didn't intend or expect to learn.  I studied CS and psychology at uni then set out to find a job in an industry that interested me. Worked as a data analyst in the pharmaceutical industry on patient data for 6 years. Then was coming to the end of that job and still looked at health related roles, but ended up working in the games industry in a web content role. That led to an interest in testing and I am now a software tester in an industry that doesn't overly interest me, but I really enjoy my job.  Health and games are still industries that interest me and I may go back to them in the future, data still interests me, and testing is something I may continue with. AI has always interested me and there's a possibility I may venture that way one day with a testing focus.  If you have a specific passion then focus on it and try to get somewhere with it. If you're focussed on money then you may also be best to focus on a specific path. In my experience taking a less conventional path also works, but it really depends on what you want out of your career.#I follow my interests.

Which team do I work for?I'm starting my new grad job next month as a Software Engineer.  My offer was to join a team that primarily works with technologies that I do not have much experience with.The office has two main engineering teams: 1. Focusing on the backend, working with big data.2. Mostly full-stack engineering, focusing on building applicationsMost of my experiences and interests align with the first team. I love working with the technologies they use and I would love to get more experience with big data. However, my offer was to join the second team. Although I'm familiar with what all the technologies are that the second team uses, I do not have much experience with any of them. My manager said that it is very possible to switch to team one if I really wanted to, although she seemed to think I'd do fine if I stayed with team two.I completely understand that I'm going to be learning a ton and should expect to learn new languages and technologies all the time, but I was hoping to get some advice on which team I would benefit more from joining.Do I look like an idiot starting out not knowing hardly anything about the technologies just to eventually learn much more about a wider range of technologies, developing my skills as a full stack engineer? Or should I join the team that is by far a better fit for my experiences and contribute much more to the office? ;No, you won't look like an idiot because they don't expect a recent grad to have a bunch of experience.  Pick the team that is doing the work/projects you're most interested in, and that you think will help you learn and grow as fast as possible.#I completely agree with what u/Riimii said. Growth is far more important than best fit, especially if your manager seemed to understand that you don't have a lot of experience with that stuff.  What I'm interested in (and I'm sure you are too) is what are more valuable qualities to develop as a software engineer: backend and big data development, or full stack development. I'd think that developing full stack skills is much more beneficial, but I honestly don't know. Does anyone have input on this?

But I haven't had any luck with job applications so far. Is it even worth applying for jobs before I go over?;"I'm a recent graduate (23), with a Masters in Software Design & Development. My thesis received the third highest mark in my class, which I wrote while working on a 12 month internship for a global enterprise services company. My research was in the areas of machine learning and data analytics. I developed sales forecasting models to perform predictive analytics on the company's sales data, and developed an algorithm to identify the most influential factors within each opportunity. My manager loved me, and would provide me with an excellent reference if needed.I've got what I would consider to be a pretty good CV. I participated in two hackathons while on my internship, where I was on the winning team for both (one was an international hackthon involving multiple company sites). I've been looking and applying for some data analytics/data scientist/big data developer roles in California. However I'm receiving no luck with these applications, all I ever get is the ""we've received your application and will respond if you're a match"" email. I guess I'm just looking for advice on whether it's worth my time to keep applying for roles that interest me, or is the fact that I'm not currently living the states a factor that's going against me in these applications? I also know California is extremely competitive for IT people, but I'm just curious about whether the companies think I'm not suited for the role, or that I may be suited, but since I'm in Ireland right now, it's not worth the effort of contacting me.So if anyone has any advice/tips on this situation, I'd love to hear them.EDIT: I don't have any issues with visas. There's a graduate visa you can get in Ireland that will sponsor you for 1 year, on the condition you find work in your degree field within 3 months of arriving. If you want to stay longer than 1 year, your work must sponsor afterwards. I can also go without needing the graduate visa if the company is willing to sponsor me instead. If it looks like my job prospects are good, I'd apply for it ASAP.";"Look at visa H-1B before doing anything. You can't just go to state without a relative and just ""live"" there. H-1B have a very specific request date range and I know now we are not in (they are probably all given for this years).   The general idea is that : 1) you need a sponsor (see job offer) 2) you pay ~10k (some company will pay that for you) 3) you can't start before the date your visa start. They have a limited amount of visa and they are ""sold-out"" very early on. You need a job offer ready before they open visa, then I think around October they start to deliver them. If you miss the boat you gotta have to wait a full year. (Note : I wan't to go to US from Canada, I graduate my master off dates, I have to push my project to 2018)#I did a quick search about the visa, and the visa only allows you to apply for internships.  This might be the reason why you're not having a lot of luck.  Does the position in the US have to be an Internship placement?     Yes, your placement in the US must be an Internship. It cannot be replacing American workers or filling a general labour need. "

Of course it's difficult for you to comment in terms of contents, as you haven't seen the documentary, but I'm mostly looking for advice in terms of writing. Please let me know if there's anything that was difficult to understand or could use some editing. I hope the format isn't too messed up. ..***The Age of Big Data***We have seen this documentary created by BBC in 2012 called ‘The Age of Big Data’. It covers various uses of data, available to us - made possible by collecting and analyzing data, and summarizing it into useful information, often in the form of patterns. This term is often referred to as data mining and is predicted to be one of the greatest sources of power in the 21st century. This correlates with the fact, that we have produced more data in the last few years than in all of human history, and we are not about to slow down anytime soon. In the documentary we are presented with five different uses of data mining  The police of Los Angeles using it to predict where crime is most likely to occur, biological uses of data by analyzing different factors like death causes and DNA and using it to diagnose and treat illnesses. It also went over data being used to personalize advertisements by predicting what people might want to buy - sometimes before they know it themselves. Lastly, it covers the application of data in astronomy, where they ‘listen’ to stars via telescopes, in order to unlock the secret of the universe. I will be focusing mostly on the first one, about the police and their way of incorporating data in the battle against crime, since this is a usage I had no trouble wrapping my head around, unlike some of the others, which I find a little abstract. The majority of my points will be applicable to all uses of data though. .I think there are some clear positives and negatives with data mining. Let us start with the positives, the first one being the ability to predict where crime is most likely to occur within the next 12 hours. It works much like a weather forecast, telling us what we can expect, which is not always what ends up happening, but it is fairly accurate.Secondly, the predictions are only going to become more reliable as we gather even more data. The algorithm used by the LAPD is based on 13 million past crimes, a number that is (sadly) only going to increase, giving us a larger sample size to build our predictions on. We also have some negative effects as well, one of them being that the predictions are not always correct, which could lead to a non-optimal distribution of officers if some of them are guarding the ‘hotspots’, while crime is happening elsewhere. Some police officers have also expressed their discontent with this, as they do not like being “controlled” by a computer, and would rather work by their instinct and experience, like they have always done. Another thing to keep in mind is the risk of the criminals figuring out the pattern, and using it to their advantage. .It is clear, that there are both plusses and minuses to ‘big data’. Personally, I am all for taking advantage of data mining, and I think it will be an important tool in the future for learning about ourselves, our planet, and the universe surrounding it, but we have to be cautious as well. We could easily become too dependent on algorithms making every decision for us, based on which option has the highest probability of a positive outcome. Do we really want an equation controlling our life?;"Don't use ""we"", ""you"", ""I"". So in your second sentence you'd say ""...data, available to everyone/available to anyone/available to people, but not ""us"".  Avoid making reference to the fact that you and others watched/read a source unless you must. Address the video directly (such as ""as was mentioned in ""big data""..."" but not ""what was learned from watching this video was"").

askphilosophy;5hcro6;1481273134.0;/r/askphilosophy/comments/5hcro6/big_data_future_scenarios/;Big Data: future scenarios;What are the worst case scenarios regarding Big Data in the future? With all of our information managed by governments and companies which will be the implications for us, are we giving up our privacy? Why do we want privacy if we are not doing anything wrong?;"information has value. is  information only of tactical value in a modern society because of morality, shame, and guilt? what if we didn’t feel bad when information about us leaked to people. would privacy be an issue in a completely moral society? is there morality in secrets? in the things that we don’t do? i understand the impulse of the individual to be private, at least in a logical sense. if we were all to develop identical perceptions of a strict set of norms, a desire to conscientiously, diligently, punctiliously, and zealously enforce and individually follow them, perhaps. And you know, it is possible that happens in the future. I mean think of how far we have come in that direction. We were once disparate groups of primates wandering the world, forming their own norms and perceptions of the world, with no communication. I imagine, with such isolation, things got weird. like really weird.imagine being in the early holocene. you are some kind of intelligent hominid that is just deciding,"" you know what, this year, we should probably have more vegetables. it’s getting harder to find enough meat to feed this many people, and we’re no longer just competing with the animals, we are competing against those folks in the next valley who try to kill us every time they see us. maybe it would be better if we figured out how to grow those edible plants nearer to us, so we don’t run into them as often, and it is easier to feed ourselves. it doesn’t have to be that organized, but as long as there are trees and edible plants somewhere we can defend and protect it easily,  we could probably manage.”  then, at some point, populations became bigger, territory expanded, different norms came into contact with each other, and boom, here we are today, with a global society that cannot agree on most things. are any of us truly moral? hard to say, probably not. I mean there are definitely some good people out there who have never done anything wrong, but they are a vast minority. for the rest of us, sharing all of our information doesn’t look as harmless. I would rather not have everyone know what I do, regardless of whether or not it is good or bad, what I do on my own time is my own. It is not for other people. Giving that solitude up means that my actions would probably be hindered by fears of social punishment or ostracism   by others. there would be nowhere to be weird anymore, and honestly, most progress comes from someone or a group of people bucking norms and saying “Hey, I know I/We/This idea is weird and different, but you should check us/it out. we might be onto something here”. what if that kind of ingenuity and intellectual and social progress was stifled? we would probably stagnate as a race, and we would never have a chance of reaching that world of no evil. so why do we want privacy? because doing wrong things (not evil things, but wrong things) can be very good, even if the world isn’t ready for them. things like big data can be amazing- but if used to surveil and monitor a population to the point where privacy is nonexistent, and all information is public to some degree, then it could be the most dangerous weapon on earth, because it could quash the weird, or the misunderstood, and halt all human progress indefinitely, or, in a nightmare scenario, could be used by someone evil to accomplish evil ends."

However the courier mishandled the package and it arrived damaged, so I'm getting my money back, but they have no others in stock to send me. So I'm looking for an alternative to it. It had the exact same specs as [this](http://www.pcworld.ie/product/asus-k501uq-156-laptop-grey/332174/396.0.0) model.* **Total budget and country of purchase:** Ireland, €800-€900* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** I already have a surface pro 4, so no need for the 2 in 1. I'd like as good as battery life as I can get while not compromising on the specs.* **How important is weight to you?**It's not crucial, but I also don't want to be carrying a brick around.* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**Windows, but will probably install Linux on it at some point too.* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 15.6"" preferably* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** I am a graduate data scientist, so mostly I would like to use this laptop for programming and development. Would be running big data tools such as Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Zookeeper etc, along with programming IDEs such as Intellij, Eclipse and RStudio. I would like to be able to game with it, since I kind of assumed a laptop capable of running those big data tools such be able to handle the processing power needed for gaming. So while a dedicated graphics card is not essential, it would be preferred. Only photo editing software I'd be running would be GIMP.* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** Games like Portal, Arkham Batman games, Far Cry etc. I'm not an avid PC gamer, so what ever the best settings/FPS I can get, I'll take.* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  Will need a good processor (i5 or i7), and at least 8GB of RAM (would like one that can be upgraded if 8 is what it comes with). Would also like it to have an SSD. * **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**I think I've pretty much covered what I will be doing with it, so I'll leave it up to your suggestions.";

But journalists across the world have access to it. Anyone have any idea how to obtain it? It's a few terabytes, which seems intimidating, but it takes about a day to process petabytes on AWS. To find the names of people involved, we would need to run a PoS tagger in a map job. Might not take all that long to find names in 11.6mil files. It's also possible to dump it all into AWS elastic search, and make it more easily searchable. It feels to me like this is the kind of problem big data was made to solve... and something like this is too precious to be left to journalists alone. EDIT: I posted this yesterday just as the story was breaking. I have newer perspectives, thanks to the comments and reading more news. They didn't give the data as such to journalists, they just made a search interface. It was tedious for the journalists to try retrieving info over 8 months. (A video from the Indian Express explained how they did the analysis, i can't seem to find that now). Wikileaks has started releasing some documents: https://www.documentcloud.org/public/search/Source:%20%22Internal%20documents%20from%20Mossack%20Fonseca%20%28Panama%20Papers%29%22/p2That said, there are very good reasons to not make all of it public as said by people with better knowledge than me in the comments:* Data Privacy. Innocent people can be targets for identity thieves and others with malicious intent, as private addresses, bank details, passports and other such sensitive documents are in the cluster. * Releasing it little by little allows to keep this news current and make sure the effects last. * The guilty might be able to take preventative action to ensure they are protected (though, if someone has the right connections, they dont need a public dataset). * It's quite frankly dangerous! people can die for digging too deep. (But if everyone has the data, we can't all be in danger?). That said, this is the sort of problem we should be working towards solving. people should be able to put out insights from a data dump without having to require deep knowledge of ML/big data. I feel now like the kind of work we all do matters in a real world tangible sense, in combating corruption. ;"Data is likely not going to be released unmodified for a few reasons, including:  * privacy issues of people involved * protecting the source * making sure that the full extent of the leak is not known * maybe copyright issues * the media already has the data, in their eyes they are the only ones that are able to responsibly report about it, so there's no need for them to give it to someone else#I doubt we will be getting a data dump on Panama Papers soon. A majority of the released datasets on PP contain a lot of redacted information; it seems like they would rather clean it first and then hand it out.  edit: It's not almost here folks. ~~http://offshoreleaks.icij.org/ has a ton of data.~~ (see /u/oberhamsi's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/4d7t1h/panama_papers_dataset/d1p3d0g))#It says ""ICIJ will release the full list of companies and people linked to them in early May.""(https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs/methodology/)#I've been looking for it too, no luck so far. Would keep checking places like pastebin, wikileaks etc. periodically, maybe something will pop up within the next few days.  The whole dataset on AWS elasticsearch would be really great, this needs to happen!!#They say they can't release raw files because of right to privacy : phones, addresses, ...

Would you want say, your credit card statements or grocery shopping history to go totally public?#There was a limited CSV available on icij.org but the site seems to be up and down at the moment.#Somebody please leak the leaked files lol.#It was released to journalists instead of the public for a reason.  They are being entrusted by the leaker with the responsibility of judiciously releasing the information.  ""Judiciously"" in this context means exposing information that it is in the public's best interest to hear, while not damaging the interests of innocent people caught up in the sweep.    Keep in mind that there are a litany of legal and moral uses for off shore banking and investment, and that the leak includes all of that activity managed by the firm as well.    It might be *mostly* shady activity.  Hell, it might be 99% shady activity.  But a raw and total release of info will expose the private data of law abiding individuals which isn't acceptable.    So the journalists will parse through it slowly using human judgement.  It's inefficient as you say, but they have a certain responsibility here.  #I will wait for the dataset. I think may be available by May. Would be good dataset to teach analytics :-)#While we're at it, I'd like to get my hands on the Unaoil dataset as well.#Good luck. You likely won't ever see all of the data.  >Do not expect a genuine expose of western capitalism. The dirty secrets of western corporations will remain unpublished.  >Expect hits at Russia, Iran and Syria and some tiny “balancing” western country like Iceland. A superannuated UK peer or two will be sacrificed – someone already with dementia.  >The corporate media – the Guardian and BBC in the UK – have exclusive access to the database which you and I cannot see. They are protecting themselves from even seeing western corporations’ sensitive information by only looking at those documents which are brought up by specific searches such as UN sanctions busters. Never forget the Guardian smashed its copies of the Snowden files on the instruction of MI6.  [Source of opinion](https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/04/corporate-media-gatekeepers-protect-western-1-from-panama-leak/)  EDIT: [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/PanamaPapers/comments/4d8ftq/editor_in_chief_of_sueddeutschede_commenting_on/) might render everything above meaningless.#There is a breakdown of filtypes on the icij.org site. And from the looks of it, a large part of it is photos(probably passports and other ID's), and PDFs(guessing for scans, maybe signed by hand) as well as emails.  The journalists state that they've went through the photos and such which OCR, which means that the actual information should fit in a much smaller set. Hoping to see how this develops.#Wikileaks is having a twitter poll of whether they should make the entire set of documents searchable. You can answer the poll on twitter  https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/716772373408718849  Edit: It's over 90% yes when I voted. But every vote counts.#[deleted]#@Sukrim is right about the restrictions. Munging alone for this amount of unstructured data is not for the faint of heart.

Reading and watching these games through the subreddits led me to believe that there are some issues in running theses games. I've even run a few AI only games on my laptop.While InfoAddict is a great mod and displays a lot of data in-game, it has some drawback and has been noted to be the cause of the odd crash in the Current Civ Battle Royale. The main reason for this I believe is that it keeps much of the data in memory, and with 62 Civs that is a lot of memory used.Also, there is much data being generated by the game that we as a community hunger for. City Flips, Resouces, Who is at War with whom, Who is Friends with who, and much, much more.As this is the First release of the mods, I'm ever grateful for feedback and any suggestions to include in future versions. Test the mods, and let me know how useful it is, or not as the case maybe.The mods are currently split into 2. The first mod is Battle Royale 62 Civs DLL and allows up to 62 Civs to play at once. The second mod is Battle Royale Data, which requires Battle Royale 62 Civs DLL to work properly, as the DLL has an expanded Lua interface which extracts more data from the game, and a basic text logger.The mods can be downloaded via the Steam Workshop.[Battle Royale 62 Civs DLL](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=653811119)[Battle Royale Data](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=653879056)/u/tpangolin, you might want to investigate the use of these mods for future battle royales.

In fact, I want to try to get this to be used en masse in AI games, because I want to do mass statistical analysis of CIV V.

You see the same difference in the diversity and quality of programming produced by HBO and the BBC. Maybe ""Big Data"" aids them in their decision making, but what really matters is the company's incentives.#How is this programming?#People use the term big data like its a magic talisman, when in fact most of it is fairly rudimentary data analysis that's been happening for decades, now on new data sets.  And I wouldn't be so certain about ""big data"" conclusions.  Data analysis is hard; there is confirmation bias, sampling bias, and all sorts of problems...one potential issue with big data is that if the set is big enough you can find almost whatever you want...#[deleted]#if the most recent installments are a result of that they failed.#I wouldn't say they created a show using it, however, they can easy to that. Then again, it would be like Hollywood already.  They basically ran the numbers to see if it would sell, and it did. #(did not read TFA)  I don't want that. I want someone reflecting on things and producing stuff like Utopia, when you watch it will pull your socks off. Big Data, no thanks. This will be a phase we all have to go through, just like Hollywood had its fads of production and (sometimes) got sane again. But I hope it will be short, as Big Data means more introspection by itself."

(more info inside);"Suppose you want to make a database from scratch with all this characteristics:- Fixed scheme- 100% immutability (only inserts and selects  nothing about updates and deletes)- Massive concurrency- Massive parallelism- Millions of users- Big data (TB, PB...)- Queries to get some specific set of data (like graph-oriented and key-value-oriented NoSQL databases)- Queries to analyze all data (like SQL databases)What programming language would be the best choice in your opinion?Of course, probably your option would be ""PostgreSQL!"", but I'm talking about a entire new system from scratch. I'm doing a research, just for curiosity. Ignore ""lack of programmers"", ""bad documentation"" or things like that. It's a 100% technical question, assuming an hypothetical scenario where you have a big team that know how to work with that language.Why am I asking here? Because Haskell seems to me the best designed programming language. That doesn't meant that would be the choice for this question, and not the faster, etc.My options would be one of this three:- Haskell- Rust- ATSMy concerns are functional programming and other modern approaches (that's why C or Assembly are not worth).What do you think? Haskell? Rust? ATS? Other language?I'm curious to know your opinions in this :P.";"Rust for memory, disc access and data structures. Haskell for database connection, query parsing and optimization.  Rust is great at handling raw memory in a relatively safe and high level way. Haskell is extremely good at transforming tree like datastructures.#I'm going to vote Rust here.  Performance, safe, made for mortal programmers.  Haskell would be nice too, but us mortal programmers aren't going to be so great at getting all the performance we can out of it, particularly in regards to memory.  As another poster said, a combination of Rust and Haskell could be very appropriate.  Edit: I do want to point out that Haskell can have very high performance. But that's a consequence of the GHC guys and other Haskell people being very smart and giving us mortals the ability to have our cake and eat it too. Yet, Haskell is built from the top-down -- its features focus on the abstract, letting compiler implementation worry about the mechanical details. So when things don't work out so great, god help us.  Rust, on the other hand, is built from the bottom-up, with any abstractions the language provides having some correlation to highly performant underlying code, giving C-like speed by natural consequence, and gives us facilities to think about how our code is utilizing the hardware. It's as much of a ""bottom-up"" language as it is a ""top-down.""#> Ignore ""lack of programmers"", ""bad documentation"" or things like that. It's a 100% technical question, assuming an hypothetical scenario where you have a big team that know how to work with that language.  You're basically saying, ""If the concerns that are important for language choice can be overlooked, which language would you choose?"" The answer to that question should probably be ""the one with the best performance""... so something like Ada, Rust, C, assembly or whatever.  The reason we have all these other languages (including Haskell!) is because programmers are fallible and we're ready to sacrifice some performance for increases in bug resistance and friendliness to the way people think, rather than machines. If you're assuming superstar programmers that don't have problems with bugs then there's no reason to choose those languages either!  ...unless you're just using a lot of words to say ""don't care about popularity"", in which case my answer is still Ada because performance sounds like an important part of your system, and performance is easier to get out of a low-level system. #Would Haskell's GC cause problems for a large database? I know RabbitMQ uses only [40% of RAM on a server](https://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html) because Erlang's GC could (worst case) 2x the memory usage. Giving up all that RAM sucks; with e.g. MySQL I can tell it to use 90% of RAM and not worry about the out-of-memory killer.  I'm not familiar with Haskell's GC at that kind of scale—would it cause that kind of problem?#Your question may be hypothetical, but if you're actually considering writing something like this, I would really urge you to consider why you want to write your own. You mentioned PostgreSQL; why is this not a solution for what you're after? Performance?  One thing I learned from working at a large software company with a lot of in-house solutions was that rolling your own isn't always the best, in fact, it's usually the worst option. There is a lot to be said for maintainability and usability. Consider that this system you're dreaming of may be in production for many years (I assume, from your list of requirements, like ""millions of users""), this means that several years from now, well after this software has been written and is stable and hasn't been updated in a long time, anyone who wants to go back and change something to it will have a learning curve just to learn how to use it, first off, and an even bigger learning curve for how to modify it.  tl;dr: If there is a really good, FOSS solution available that meets your requirements, like PostgreSQL, use that instead.#Have you checked OCaml? It's designed to be well performing, it's functional, it's mature. Eg.  [Irmin](https://github.com/mirage/irmin) is a database written in OCaml.#I would use Haskell to write a prototype, in order to verify my beliefs and learn about the domain. Then I would see how far I could get with a Haskell implementation, and ask around if I ran into some major problems. In the best case, since my database is going to be so amazingly great, it will invite lots of community participation and maybe even corporate backing, so it should be possible to solve the major technical blockers if any show up.#Fixed Scheme, Massive Concurrency, and Massive Parallelism are things that would be easy in Haskell.#That's something that bothers me about Haskell. It seems that it should be a good choice for a NoSQL database (safety, less prone to certain bugs, compiled to native binary) but of all the numerous NoSQL DBs none are written in Haskell as far as I know. Why is that?#I'd definitely go with Haskell, but I may be biased.  It's not that difficult to write a DB from scratch that can serialize a million or more updates per second on one machine (verifying it is probably 99% of the work). Since you're only doing inserts and selects, you don't have to worry about transaction like interactions and can just split your data across multiple essentially single server DBs each with ungodly amounts of RAM.#Honestly, I'd use Haskell. Of your characteristics, the one that I think would be the source of most of the work is massive concurrency (big data as well, but that just turns into massive concurrency), and Haskell has Cloud Haskell as a great starting point. Once you're at a point where you can easily distribute work and data across a set of machines everything else becomes straight-forward enough.  I have to say, I find it strange to look through the responses here and not see a lot of Haskell proponents. Databases are easy to make cache-friendly and Haskell has good support for doing low level memory operations. I would be very surprised if Rust, for example, could out perform Haskell by enough of a margin to overcome the overhead of all the network activity.#ATS: memory-safe, easy interoperability with C, type-safe, good fit for low-level work (can use it without GC, or with custom memory allocator).#https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HaskRel might be relevant.#Serious question: how would you have a database that cannot insert and update? Would you point it at a JSON file or something like that?#JavaScript#[deleted]"

This means your profile can be accessed by anyone. Your data include ""Date and Time"" (played) in your game history and i find it problematic because it tells something about you. More than you could possibly think.  It is something easy to exploit in silly ways. ""Total Time Played"" also tells something. The question is first ethical and could even be a legal matter.One example: your employer could track your activity and if it happened that you were playing at work (sure no one does...) he could you use this to fire you. Even if not the main reason someone could use this as an argument. A jealous colleague could also harm you this way. Yes people can be bad.There are many other examples, it could be about your family, your relatives. It may sound futile or paranoiac but at the age of big data this should be taken very seriously. Public data is easy to exploit. Period.You would argue, these are only pseudos and not real names. Well if you know a bit the person or you know how to cross some data in many cases you can find who is behind. Much easier than you could possibly imagine.There is actually an option in hotslogs to make your account **private**. But i'm afraid it's not the good answer. It will remove the links to your profile, remove you from leaderboards and from the search. So in many ways it's bad for the community. If everyone had their profile private, hotslogs would lose a part of its interest and maybe some traffic for the owner. Meanwhile i've put my profile private.The basic solution would be to hide this column ""Date and Time"" from the history. I suggest it should simply be removed. ""Total Time Played"" should also be removed. Alternatively, these could be displayed for the owner of the account only. Or make the history private by default. Or there could be a new privacy option ""public limited"" letting the user choose if he wants this specific data public or whatever. Well there are many possible solutions.I've discussed this a bit with https://www.reddit.com/user/barrett777 who i appreciate a lot for his awesome work and reactivity and i don't want anyone to feel bad about this. But i think it's an important question that all the hotslogs users should be aware of.**TL DR: in hotslogs ""Date and Time"" (history) and ""Total Time Played"" say something about your private life. It should not be public data by default and it would be sad to have everyone using the private option.**";I think that hiding date and time is a reasonable suggestions.   Total Time Played can be easily calculated starting from total games, but it doesn't mean much if you don't know the time frame over it has occurred.#So my employer would happen to know my Battle.net username or Battletag? And he'd casually know about Hotslogs as well? How would he provide proof that it was me who was playing on that account and that I wasn't sharing it with my kid/brother/friend?   Don't get me wrong, I get what you're saying, but still, that's a great exagerration. Also, if your employer would want to know if you have been playing video games at work when you weren't supposed to, trust me, there's a lot of easier ways to do so.#It's not private. It's available to 9 other players in that match who are free to do whatever they want with that data, there is no agreement between you and them that they won't share the replay on the internet.  The only thing that I could potentially consider private is the in-game allied chat (in case you play in a party for example), but Hotslogs actually deletes alll the chat data from the replays so that's not a problem.  If you are paranoid you can make your profile private. Thank Ben for that because I think he doesn't have to give you that option.  Also, match history and total games played are available in game too. You just need to appear on a chat channel.#If you're irresponsible enough to play hots while you should be working you deserve to get fired anyway.# A jealous colleague could also harm you this way. Yes people can be bad.  Do you use your real name as the nickname? #this is really only a problem if 1)your boss knows your username, 2)knows you play hots (more likely), 3)has become an actual problem at work. a random dickhole boss probably isn't going to be able to find this information unless you have it linked to something that points to you being the account holder, which is probably only a situation in which you're getting paid for playing the game or something#Unless your BattleTag is your real life name, this doesn't show any private information at all. #I only wish everyone were this paranoid/concerned about data that actually DOES matter. Not that it doesn't matter in hots, as per your examples, but this is small potatoes compared to most of what we give up on a daily basis.  (Sorry, security nut here.)  The nice part of this, is someone needs to know hotslogs is a thing. And it's not unheard of to play some hots when you call in sick from work or something. It's not like saying you're sick and in fact at a concert or, worse yet, committing fraud by claiming disabled when in fact playing sand volleyball every day.  For your examples, though, it's possible the person playing too much hots actually has some other underlying problem/addiction? Just a thought.#Honestly I don't see any real reason *not* to have something like this.

Looking overbought so trying to add on a decent pullback. Leader in visual computing chips (GPU). Video games, television, virtual reality, autonomous cars, big data. They surprisingly have a dividend of 1.4%. Revenue and cash flow are at all time highs. Facebook is the first company to adopt NVIDIA Tesla M40 GPU accelerators to train deep neural networks. ;Also check AMD. Gone from 1.84 to 2.73 with recent news of VR use etc. low price play with some added risk in the same sector. #I regret not picking more $NVDA up in the $26 range back in Feb when I had the chance. $NVDA could very well keep up this momentum, it's a highly stable growth stock. At the very least, I don't think any pull back that could happen in the near future would be very significant. Likely around 4%. #ive owned nvda for years and just decided to make some trades involving them in the nxt 2 months.  i am bullish on it long term and can see the stock at 100+ in 3-4 year range, but right now i think like most other things in the market it is becoming a bit inflated.  http://seekingalpha.com/article/3915666-nvidia-will-drop-q1  i read this article a while back and it sort of seems to be coming together. it broke all time highs almost, 10 years ago the 37ish high still stands. i see big upside with VR, cars, mobile gpus needed in every device etc. they are on the edge of entering some big money markets.  for the short term i think i will get calls for late may or june as i expect it to climb for earnings. they also have an unveil on the 5th of their pascal processor. i dont see how it can be bad unless its stats are worse than amds by a large margin. it should increase the stock being overbought even more when rsi is already at 70. based on the article i am not sure what to expect on their earnings, you can look at the surprise %s and stuff yourself may is poor for them. i might get puts in early may before earnings on the 5th.  my ideal scenario would be to sell the calls early may for profit, buy cheap puts, sell them after earnings drop and then buy more stock if it drops.  the dividend is pretty solid and i love their stuff. i think the more tech oriented we become the more they will be needed.#upvoted for your trill username stay icey#NVDA is an excellent long investment.#You missed every entry point possible tho. The best pullback was in January. NVDA will never go to such lows again unless the Pascal GPUs are a massive flop.#I don't really see how it can go anywhere but up. They practically have a monopoly, they are the defacto standard gpu maker for any high performance computing and they are the best gpu for gaming. Easy long term play in my opinion.#nVidia's biggest competition is AMD though with their Radeon cards, and AMD is killing them in the VR market because everyone is using AMD tech in their headsets (like Oculus, HTC). Plus unless you're an nVidia fan boy, most people are using AMD in their gaming setups because their video cards are generally cheaper but have just as good of performance if not better. I think unless nVidia does something soon to bring back the gaming market, we see it start to drop.

Will there be a point of little/diminishing returns?  In other words, is there a point at which knowing any more about a person doesn't help in extracting more money from them (outside blackmail)? Otherwise, given how cheap data storage has become, are we stuck with companies recording every interaction in the hopes that some of it can be put to use?;"Well Big Data isn't just about gathering data, it's about being able to perform the right analyses. With the rise of machine learning and data science, I can only see Big Data getting even bigger. Also most data is proprietary, so it's something that needs to be actively accrued by every company, although again, most of the work is in the analysis, not the gathering. #> is there a point at which knowing any more about a person doesn't help in extracting more money from them (outside blackmail)?  Yes, definitely. But unlike selling commodities, where you have to give the person say a frappachino to get their $5, In ""big-data"" markets, you just observe them for free (almost), and then sell or use the resulting data. This supports extracting much smaller sums of money from people before the decreasing returns become a problem."

Seems to me that everybody is still trying to figure out the best way to process the high volumes of data.You've got Messaging handlers like Kafka etc. and processing tools like Spark. I'd say the ""plumbing"" is still done manually with companies like Talend catching up with tools and with companies like Hortonworks offering complete platforms.So I'm wondering if the current state of writing Spark jobs manually, configuring your platform manually will soon be replaced by full suites offered by vendors like IBM. Similar to all the Data Warehouse tools today. And that it's just a ""transitioning phase"" right now.Or are the problems too specific and the solutions will always be too complicated?What are your thoughts?";"I wouldn't call the distinction manual vs automated as much as packaged solutions vs custom solutions.  ETL has had packaged solutions since its inception in the early 90s.  They haven't completely dominated the field and replaced custom solutions for a variety of reasons that still apply:     * many are basically frameworks using diagram-driven CASE technology from the 1980s that make the easiest 80% of the job slightly easier and the hardest 20% a lot harder.    * many have been expensive    * few have supported the best features and flexibility of highly productive general purpose languages: unit test frameworks, CI testing, version control, devops, daemonizing/scheduling, logging, platforms, monitoring, etc    * most programmers have not wanted to work with them  So, in spite of vendor excitement about monetizing this space, it seems like the problem domain resists most of these efforts.  Kinda like how frameworks like FrontPage didn't replace writing web apps ten years ago.#For plenty of use cases, yes ETL is replaced.

Specifically with machine learning, I have some amount of worry that an algorithm designed to optimize for X fact will make and produce many results that people will be willing to follow, and accept as not biased at all, with negative consequences.  Imagine an insurance company that makes a machine that predicts potential damage to the insured goods, and the machine learns over time that less money means higher chance of damage.  The company trusts this machine as an unbiased source of info, and explicitly starts charging poor people more money.  This would be a source of bias that you can't attribute to anyone, and as the machine has no ""default racism/sexism/classism"" built into it like a human does, it may be hard to get discrimination charges to stick.  It's not even in design, either, I don't think this is a result of a lack of diversity in tech, but the nature of relation-machines.  When you start making relations, you start stereotyping, and when you start doing this you create biases and activities that can harm people based only on the group they are in.  The machines will be accurate in making these assumptions, and I don't think society has learned the fact that discrimination is often done for valid reasons, it's just that the harm we do to people by discrimination is more severe than the benefit we get.  It'll be interesting to see that side of things develop, and I'm sure that in the long run things will turn out OK, but there will be bumps on the road for sure.#> His arrests, she said, were “typical of someone who doesn’t have a permanent home”—loitering, for example—and none led to convictions.  This reminds me of the similar problem cycle of filtering people out based on their credit- you're poor so you have had credit problems so nobody will hire you so you can't get a job and continue to have credit problems.  I don't understand how conservatives can honestly believe just working hard can lift you out of poverty.  Not in the US, for sure.#Completely off topic and only somewhat related.  Another thing that isn't talked about - access to cable, internet, etc.  Something like 50% of the population (really low) is online, and only a small portion of that.  Something like 50% of the population has cable.  90% of this year's presidential debates have been online, on cable, but *not on network television*.  The only exception is CBS News's hosted debate.  That's a huge amount of the population without access to this, and only gets that information disseminated as ratings-friendly soundclips.#Yep. Data is only as good as the people interpreting it. I've never seen anything good come from massive generalizations based on statistics that lack context to region or municipality. The privatized intelligence community is pretty freaking scary too. Thompson-Reuters manages a database called World-Check that has the ability to black list people as terrorists. Last year it was revealed that 40% of the people black listed had absolutely no ties to terrorist organizations at all, and had largely been targeted by algorithm looking for ""suspicious sounding names."" In other words, if you're name is Adam, you're fine. If your name is A'da Abu Hamid you're fucked. Not only that, but World-Check is used by the Department of Homeland Security, so some of these people were lucky enough to get on the No-Fly list! Companies like Hire-Right and national banks also use World Check, so sometimes these people can't get jobs or even open bank accounts.

datascience;4cqaid;1459435173.0;/r/datascience/comments/4cqaid/causal_discovery_software_available_for_big_data/;Causal Discovery Software Available for Big Data Analysis;The Center for Causal Discovery (CCD) (www.ccd.pitt.edu) has released the Fast Greedy Search (FGS) algorithm (an optimized version of Chickering's Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm) for use by biomedical investigators who are searching for causal associations in large sets of continuous data.  A technical paper describing the optimization is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07749.  It is available as free and open source software. This release is just the first step toward providing a suite of algorithms that will assist biomedical researchers in analyzing their data to obtain causal insights. Using simulated data, FGS was able to learn a causal network on data containing 50,000 variables and 1,000 samples in about 15 minutes on a laptop computer. While FGS does not model hidden variables that cause two or more measured variables, an upcoming release of another algorithm will do so.FGS is available as a command line implementation (Causal-cmd) that calls a local Java library or as a Java web application (Causal-web) that runs the analysis at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center  the API’s can also be run through R (R-causal) or Python (Py-causal).

I'm self-learning computer science. I hope this isn't the wrong place to post this.I heard good things about the book ""Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference by Judea Pearl"" and want to be able to read it.However, on a first read, it seems above my level and I'm not familiar with much of the jargon used. It seems to presume some knowledge about A.I. (of which I have little). I am only a beginner - I've completed MIT's online offerings of 6.00.1x (Intro to CompSci), 6.00.2x (Intro to Computational Thinking), 6.041x (Intro to Probability), some data analytics modules, UCB's Big Data with Apache Spark course, among others.Could you please suggest textbooks for me to read before attempting Judea Pearl's book again?Thank you!";"Try 6.034 (AI), and make sure that you have enough probability/logic to understand Bayesian inference.#I haven't read that book by Pearl but attempted to get anywhere with one of his later ones called ""Causality"". I'm not sure if that's any use to you but for ""Causality"", you'd need some measure theory, probability theory, and graph theory. #Pearl has a new book out [Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/PRIMER/)  > This book is accessible to anyone with an interest in interpreting data, from undergraduates, professors, researchers, or to the interested layperson.  I think the new book is aiming to get the work on causal inference into the undergraduate curriculum and might be your best starting point."
Entrepreneur;4cq5cz;1459433144.0;/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4cq5cz/help_me_find_a_new_perspective_on_a_product/;Help me find a new perspective on a product;"To give you some background, I am a software developer based in Johannesburg, South Africa. I've been approached by a medical doctor who is currently complaining about the high price and poor quality of medical practice software in the industry.I've been asked to enter into a partnership with the doc, and together he envisions us ""disrupting"" the medical industry with a new practice management system for the medical industry. With a quick Google search, you can pretty much gauge that there are a ton of software systems that exist already, with all of them pretty much doing the same thing:* They are all standalone desktop applications* They all look like shit (The user interface is ancient and none of them are web applications)* They are all charging a high price and making shit tons of moneyI suppose that they are all good enough for the African continent in general, as internet access and speed are our major challenges. (4MBps ADSL line is considered a luxury in most areas)So basically I need to bounce some ideas around and also get some new ideas from the community here so that it would suit the kind of environment we operate in, as well as offer more value than the current competitors at less than half the price.My ideas for the model would be:* develop a simple practice management system using a bunch of API's that already exist for this type of system (links welcome) and sell add ons at a premium*Sell a full system at a reduced price, and have doctors agree to share information on the system for use in analytical applications (Big data in healthcare - could possibly generate revenue by selling data from a large user base)*Sell the system at a reduced price and have advertising within the app?Basically I want to create a product that provides a better experience, at the best price.Potential Challenges:1. Reluctance to move over to a new system because of all the patient information. How could we incentivize this?2. Best platform to build this? Web app or less shitty desktop app I'd appreciate any feedback, ideas and motivation you guys might have. :-)";"Hi Moe,  The medical software that is out there, is a joke.  Not only from the use of doctors but from the end users.  I lived in Washington, DC for 3 years and was working with a gentleman there on a medical application for the VA system in the US.  This was my experience and it may only relate to the US.  There is an incredible amount of red tape and hoops you have to jump through to get a medical application in practice.  I could write a full post of all the challenges we had but I'll summarize them.  1. Certification - If you are providing to private practices (in the US), you have to be HIPPA compliant.  This is an expensive process to get certified.  $10K+ to get.  If you are supplying to the US Government (VA) they require an even stricter certification that was $50K+... so you have to pay to play.  2. Getting practices to switch - The current systems are so deeply embedded in their operations its really hard to get them to switch.  Why would they incur all the costs to switch?  Even if you provide it for free, their time has a cost to it.  It's not like they are hurting for business, and patients won't stop going to them because of the their poor software.  These types of changes will only come when they are required.  If I was to try to do it, I would start on the patient side.  Build something that would allow them to tap into the medical system and create the demand and pressure from their side.  Of course you have all the security issues, and most of the current medical applications don't have open APIs.  However, trying to tackle this from the practitioners side is going to be long, frustrating, and expensive.  You have to know the right people.  We had an ""in"" at several places with a world renown doctor and still couldn't make an headway.   I don't want to discourage you, but I wanted to set proper expectations.  Where normal business practices would seem to prevail, the medical industry doesn't follow those rules.  Meaning saving money, lower cost, more effective, better experience, etc. doesn't always prevail.#If I ever need to go through a medical procedure, I absolutely don't want to know I'm treated by doctors using poor quality software.  Get patients to realize this fact."

Can ya'll recommend 2 more classes for me to take before I graduate. I am trying to immerse myself in the subject because I have recently learned how important CS is to any field. I have the following classes listed below. You can also recommend other classes too, my objective is to build a strong foundation to then be able to teach myself other subjects.

Without being able to see the course descriptions I can't tell you which course that is, but it's usually a pre-req for most of the rest of the other advanced courses.  #* Data structures and algorithms; * Programming languages.  Everything else you can pick up on the fly.#Most employers in the cs field have told me data structures is the most important class you can take, and data structures are very important, so my vote is cs228#CS324E or CS327E and whatever the Elements of Data Visualization is.#OP, just so you know, you haven't yet taken any actual computer science. You've just taken courses covering programming languages and basic programming techniques (which is very important for an engineer), but data structures and algorithms will be very different than what you're used to (though you've definitely gotten a taste of data structures before, this course will be significantly more in depth). If you're interested in big data and its implementations, you should take statistics courses instead, especially ones that require you to learn R/S. Data structures and algorithms will be very useful courses if you want to end up as a software guy, but if you're wanting to be an engineer working in oil, then you should take stats and not data structures/algorithms. If you don't believe me, look through [CLRS](http://bayanbox.ir/view/4177858657730907268/introduction-to-algorithms-3rd-edition.pdf), which is the standard algorithms course for sophomores. I highly doubt this is what you're wanting, and it definitely won't be covering big data type issues. Definitely take some stats courses, especially since UT-Austin has one of the best stats programs in the world.  #being very comfortable with relational databases will be a huge benefit for an engineer (particularly for one interested in big data) so ""Elements of Databases"" is by far the most pragmatic for your situation."

indonesia;4dle1t;1459943331.0;/r/indonesia/comments/4dle1t/we_know_the_indonesian_government_should_use_the/;We know the Indonesian government should use the data for decision making but to what end/for what purpose? Why is data-driven decision making good? How can the government use big data?;;"Worked on data governance and big data use inside Indonesia govt here. Truth is, ministries & agencies who claim to have big data actually don't really have one. Consider census data which is used for virtually all development indicators and target: you can fit the raw data in a $20 USB flash disk, it's only renewed once every 10 years, and most decision making process uses the aggregated version of it (which usually fits within e-mail attachment limit). Hell, we don't even know how much people actually earn since so few pay taxes anyway and so many things went unreported.   Second biggest problem is that we lost a lot of data because nobody really bothers to think of archival process. Case in point, last presidential election is the first time where we actually record and have multiple copies of results in polling booth level. Nobody even have anything lower than provincial level for the election before 2004.  Some exception do apply. LAPAN and BIG heavily invest on the necessary infra & people to store their terabytes of satelite imagery, and their data is actually used for other ministries.   Beyond that, I dread every meeting where ""data driven decision"" and ""big data"" phrase is mentioned. More often than not, my reaction is a deep sigh.#As business intelligence person I think I can answer this.   Through big data, government can see the characteristics of their population. Depending on how expansive their data gathering is, they can know how people spend their money, how much time spent by people doing things, what kind of demographics that are prone to be poor, unemployed and/or uneducated.   Using all this information, they can come up with targeted programs to deal with vulnerable areas (e.g. Welfare program that subsidize big part of poor people's spending, more investment to schools in areas with high risk of uneducated people) or it can go to even be more nuanced public relations (e.g. What media they should use to make certain announcement to receive the greatest exposure to their audience, what wording that would be most effective to cause desired outcome)#well, it's good for anything and everything. Making decision without a basis of data is what we call a guesswork. We don't want our government to make wild guess based on a hunch, do we?  This is why we should support any and every government programs that aim to collect data of its citizens. We must sacrifice individual privacy for the better of our country. Remember what Jesus, Buddha, and Muhammad jointly said in their respective autobiographical novels: ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.#After I read this article about paradox, I think big data can be used as political tools to do what he want (for good or bad thing)   https://blog.forrestthewoods.com/my-favorite-paradox-14fab39524da#.w40dm8kbl   To quote from the article   >No matter how much data you have you still have to ask the right questions.

You will find jobs that pay a lot of money and involve big data. But you will not find entry level jobs.I recently took a HackerRank coding puzzle that was emailed to me as part of a job search and HackerRank offered Scala as one of the languages that you could do the puzzle in, but all the Jobs were Java/Python.This annoys me. I am looking for my first paid coding job and I went through a lot of trouble to learn Scala, so it frustrates me that none of the jobs that involve Scala are available to me.What can we do to bring Scala to the younger, entry level, and junior  developers?";"Just apply for the mid-level jobs. Good teams hire for attitude and desire to learn, not for a list of checked tick marks. You'll figure out who's good and bad quickly.#Just apply for mid level jobs anyways. There isn't that much difference in responsibility in a junior and mid level developer outside of perhaps being able to work more autonomously. So be prepared the emphasize that in your interview.  Also, it may just be your location, a quick search for junior positions on Indeed in my area(Washington, DC) revealed about 100 positions, I did not find my own place of employment on the list which is looking for Scala developers at all skill levels, so I don't believe it to be comprehensive.#The [Underscore Scala jobs board](http://underscore.io/jobs/) highlights jobs where junior applicants are welcome. Location and the possibility of remote work are also listed.#I would think that [scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) might be a possible path. There are probably more entry level web development jobs, and given the unsuitability of JavaScript for programming-in-the-large, more employers might be sympathetic to the use of Scala as a web development language.  Disclaimer: I'm not connected to the development of scala.js, just a grateful user. #Learning one language and then finding a series of jobs that use that language is only a practical way to go for languages that have massive usage, like Java and C#. I'm sure that with hindsight, you would have checked Scala demand before investing a lot of time into learning it, as opposed to skills that are easier to get that first job with. I strongly believe learning a language like Scala is a great career investment, but it may not have minimized time-to-first-job. I wouldn't get down about it, because your Scala skills will eventually come in handy, once you build some work experience.  As someone who has led Scala teams, I would rather frankly rather hire someone who is an accomplished programmer with a strong interest in learning Scala than a person with Scala experience but no track record. I'm sure many would feel the same way. So, the way I see it, you have three choices.  - You can keep trying for an entry-level Scala gig. That's going to be  a tall order. - You can find ways to build proof of your Scala skills through independent work. To many places who are hiring, accomplishment in open-source work is on par with accomplishment in paid work. There are lots of great projects out there to contribute to in the Scala ecosystem. - You can learn a language that has better employment on-ramps, like Javascript.  As an aside, reading your responses throughout this page, you should consider putting some work into how you present yourself. Someone dropping a ""that's retarded"" in normal, public conversation would be a red flag many places.#You dont nessecerily have to know the language the firm code in, in order to get hired as a intern/junior dev. All programmers have been where you are right now, but what all professional programmers have done at some point, is to just let go of that anxiety and fake it till you make it. So who cares if they program java or python and you code Scala, they don't expect you to know it from the beginning anyway, what they expect you to do is to go home and read a book about it. "

Where exactly are you expecting data to ""pile up?"" #Your question is about centralized systems.  Like saying ""how does Facebook manage data?""  But OB is decentralized, it's a protocol.  It's like asking if BitTorrent will run out of storage, or asking who's responsible for storing email.  It's distributed, the storage for your transactions and charges are on your machine.  When you run a store, that data is on your machine.  No-one but you is expected to store your data.#Andreas Ant. discusses this in the video that was posted in this sub:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hin6etppaI&feature=youtu.be&t=9680  He had no concerns about scaling and explained that each person's ""store"" requires very little data and that millions of stores can be saved on the memory available in a typical smartphone."

It only had a SATA HDD. So i bought a SATA M.2 SSD to run the OS on.There are no boot priority options in the BIOS for the different drives. Only Windows Boot Manager and the DVD drive if there is a DVD in there. So i just booted the windows DVD and installed Windows 10 on the SSD. This worked fine and the clean windows 10 install boots every time.So sofar so good. I wanted 1 big data partition though for the HDD. The HDD was split into 4 partitions. I was not able to merge any of them in windows. So i booted the windows installer and deleted all of them there. This obviously screwed my boot up. My drives look like this now:- Drive 1: Unallocated drive of 1 TB- Drive 2: 16 MB reserved partition and 465 GB partition with my windows (which i want to keep intact)So yeah i just want to be able to boot the windows that's still there and keep drive 1 as a data disc.Here are my observations:- The BIOS doesn't show the Windows boot manager anymore as a boot option. Only the DVD drive- I think the HDD is still the primary drive. I have no idea how to change this to the SSD.- I've been trying a lot by booting with the windows DVD and going to the command prompt and using bootrec.exe. But no luck. The laptop only boots to the BIOS and there is no windows boot manager there. Commands like /fixmbr and /fixboot say operation completed. /Rebuildbcd finds the windows installation.

The bios of the laptop is Aptio Setup Utillity. There is a mapping there with the UEFI. By formatting the HDD i removed the original mapping. So i had to remap it to the new location on the SSD manually. See the link below: https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Restoring_UEFI_boot_entry_via_motherboard_replacement_or_BIOS_update#Entering_the_UEFI_Boot_Entry_manually_in_BIOS  Edit: Well i got windows to boot. But now i'm unable to shut it down, shut down just takes me to the login screen. I'm doing research now...#When in doubt, throw it out.  Remove the M.2 drive and see if you get different results.  #why not just boot of a windows USB and delete all of the damn partitions and start fresh?#Oh this is simple. Hold shift and right click the start button. Press disk management. Right click the unallocated drive and press ""create new simple volume"" or something like that. Allocate the full size of the drive, then give it a drive letter and file system type (NTFS works best on windows but only windows with some exceptions), wait and you should be done. The reason its doing this is because windows has no idea what kind of drive it is, because its blank. So you need to tell it is has a file system type of X (such as NTFS) and is Y megabytes big.  You can also use an Ubuntu USB and some programs to fix the MBR. Such as this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=622828"

haskell;4dq28m;1460015027.0;/r/haskell/comments/4dq28m/workflow_automation/;Workflow automation;"Hello,I am facing a problem that I feel like smart people have solved so I would like to discuss it with you.My current workflow involves more than a few tasks that it makes sense to automate. When I started working on the cluster of projects I am currently working on I used makefiles (which was my goto tool for automation/system state management) but things got out of hand very quickly so I wrote some bash scripts to help out but that didn't help too much either. So I started experimenting with [shake](http://shakebuild.com/) but that also fell short after some time. I think the best tool would be something all the cool kids use lately for deploying agile containerized microservises to process big data on the cloud like ansible or chef (ie not a build system), but I tend to be suspicious of new technologies that might use `leftpad`. I value the opinion of fellow functional programmers so I wanted to hear what you think before I switch yet again.To give you a feel of the kinds of tasks I am dealing with, here are some examples:## Simple build system stuffMake sure binary files are up to date with source files.## More complex build system stuffDownload archive, extract it, make some changes, archive, rsync with server.## Manage git repositoriesI need some git automation tasks to act as dependencies for other computation. Some of these tasks may be simple like ""make sure X repo is at B branch and that branch is in sync with upstream"" and sometimes may are fairly complex:- Clone a project or pull the ""development"" branch- Create or switch to a branch based on some version- Merge development into that branch- Maybe apply some automated changes to the source tree (eg sync some files, update versions in manifest files etc)- If changes were applied push the branch.## Run processes that need to succeedBasically make sure everything is in order and run tests before doing anything that would upload anything anywhere.## Run processes and waitMostly this would mean fire up a bunch of server applications (http, database) if they are not already there, make sure the proper files are compiled and in the correct directories, and open a browser at a specific page for manual testing.";It sounds like nix might be interesting for you: https://nixos.org/nix/#I use Shake for a lot of this stuff at work currently. It's well documented, but doesn't convey a lot of what you can do with it super well until you spend some time staring at the API or asking on the mailing list.#[Propellor](https://propellor.branchable.com/) might be worth a look - although I'll also second Nix/NixOS/Nixops.#First of all split up building and deployment. Building gives you deployable artifacts (binaries, apt packages, docker images etc).  > apply some automated changes to the source tree  Looks like a major red flag - why do automated changes live in the source tree but not derived and applied at build time?  > Mostly this would mean fire up a bunch of server applications (http, database)  Is this about your development or production setup? Regardless, you can use docker-compose for development environment setup. For system setup, you can use Ansible (it's the best system setup/deployment orchestration solution :)
datascience;4crt3j;1459454795.0;/r/datascience/comments/4crt3j/master_in_statistic_or_computer_science/;Master in Statistic or Computer Science;Hello everyone,I'm about to graduate in May with a B.S. degree in CS. I’m planning to go to graduate school immediately afterwards. My goal is to become a data scientist focusing on machine learning and AI.I’ve looked at my school M.S. program for data science and most of the classes are Big Data related. One of my friends said I should get a M.S. in Statistics instead because it will be more useful.Which M.S. degree should I go for (CS/Math/Stat)? It would be greatly appreciated if someone can tell me the pros and cons of these degrees. ;"Firstly, if you want to work seriously in machine learning and in particular AI, with focus on the mathematical and algorithmic development side, you're going to go up against some extraordinarily talented competition.   (By this I mean being able to publish papers in JMLR for instance).   You may be up for it, but that's unquestionably a top-level PhD route, probably in CS or, secondarily, Statistics from a ML friendly department like Stanford.   For getting a decent commercial job with a master's, I think that a CS with more heavy software focus will be more generally applicable.  At my job we hire from various backgrounds, but we won't hire somebody who uses ""just packages"", i.e. has just light scripting experience and uses R and SAS, which is what many statistics programs do.   (if you're going into biomedical statistics, an entirely different area, then that's fine).  We want people who can really program.  Significant Java/C++ systems are OK, don't need kernel drivers.   In a practical year long project in industry, I've seen averages of  around about 4 weeks of 'analytics/machine learning', 30 weeks of software engineering and 18 weeks of data cleaning with business & project meetings & powerpoints interspersed continuously.   On the resume, generally CS = higher salary than Statistics or Math in the beginning; at least there is the perception that there is more competition for good CS graduates.#It's good that you already know what career path you want to follow because that alone tells you which classes will maximize your ROI. The exact title of your MSc matters little to none. That said, look for classes that will make you more employable. For academic ML, that's any class that covers some area of mathematical statistics. For a data science org, that's algorithms, presentability and business acumen. If there are classes which expose you to companies (via a long project, dissertation, etc) opt for those.#Would you rather study the data, build the models and fine tune them,  or develop the software the handles the data before being fed into the model.  I would recommend stats but take a lot of comp sci data classes.  Ultimately computer science means you get a job, and statistics means you don't have to deal with a UI.  What you do the 5-10 years after grad school will determine if you have what it takes to work in machine learning and take that stats to the next level.  I am currently on year 3 out of undergrad with a stats major working on a development team considering if I should go back for my masters in the next 5 years.  so take this with advice grain of salt."

GrassrootsSelect;4cl9ox;1459351896.0;/r/GrassrootsSelect/comments/4cl9ox/looking_for_information_about_how_voter_data_is/;Looking for information about how voter data is discovered and handled, and what it means to grassroots politicians;From what I understand political parties contract software vendors, and under this contract party runners are given access to the party database. Each individual campaign is responsible for populating their share of the system and hires their own data team.Its also my understanding that voter data is incredibly dynamic and can target a range of information such as what you buy, what you wear, who you've donated to, your health, ect. (I'd like to learn more about this). This data is somehow captured, and I suspect bought from a range of sources by... the vendor? The party? The campaign? Once this data is in the system, whose responsibility is it to keep safe? I don't think a specific campaign would be the entity to directly buy voter data, but they would be collecting data freely from calling and polling in a variety of ways where info is offered by supporters. This data is most likely structured, much easier to process.So what about the type of data that is unstructured? Audio, images, email, call center transcripts, social media, forums, blogs, GPS, mobile data, PDF files, etc.. are grassroots politicians given the same chance at buying, storing and analyzing this kind of data? The type of database for analyzing unstructured data is very different from structured data, is their access to the party database and the tools they use to analyze that data equal to one another, or does this depend entirely on the data science team of each campaign? My suspicion (ungrounded, I'm just trying to learn more with this) is that handling unstructured data is at a higher cost so whatever entity that is filling campaign databases with unstructured data (if that's the case) would be backing an establishment politician. I'm not sure if that entity would be the campaign, the party, or the vendor, or even a super PAC. I don't know if there are rules against a super PAC passing data on to campaigns for targeting voters.  If I got any of this wrong please correct me. I'm familiar with big data and data warehousing processes, right now I'm researching data lakes, but not at all with how political campaigns handle it let alone a grassroots candidate.;

How are developers who are already working expecting to work with the oncoming changes?  Go back to school?  Climb up company ladders?Forgive me.  I know I've been asking a lot of questions on this subreddit, but I guess a lot of my question asking is drawn a lot from fear of not finding stability in the future with a career in development.  ;> With how much more significant machine learning is becoming  There are actually very few machine learning jobs. Take a look at some job sites. I just did a quick search on LinkedIn and it shows 168 local jobs mentioning Java and just 6 mentioning Machine Learning. Most companies hiring developers aren't doing cutting edge software. The main source of jobs these days is web, mobile, and in-house (web) applications to run the business.  > How are developers who are already working expecting to work with the oncoming changes? Go back to school? Climb up company ladders?  Here are some ways: learn on your own (books, videos, tutorials, side projects, etc), get your company to send you to training, do a bootcamp that teaches the skills you're looking for, move up into management, find a job that is a blend of what you know and what you want to know, take night courses, etc.   > stability in the future  There is no such thing as stability in software development. If you're 20 now and expect to work to the usual retirement age of 65 (which will likely increase as people are living longer and longer these days), that's 45-ish working years. 45 years ago people were giving computers input on punch cards and there wasn't the Internet as we know it today. You'll have to learn new things throughout your career.#Oh absolutely.   I feel sorry for all those developers who never learned mobile development or web development. They are completely unemployable. No other jobs except mobile and web.  Every five years or so if you don't learn the new trend, that is the end. No more jobs. You're just unemployable.   All those C++ guys? Nah, they haven't jobs in **decades**. VB? Don't make me laugh, unemployed since the early 2000's. Embedded development? That trend passed years ago.#I really think you're overestimating what machine learning can do. Machines can't program (once they can at the level we can we have bigger issues than 'having jobs'). ML has created some new jobs but if it's taking jobs away it's data entry jobs, not development jobs.#If an area is hot now, there is no guarantee it will still be hot 5+ years from now.  Then the market will be flooded with experienced people who have now-obsolete skills.  If you pick the wrong thing, you can wind up unemployable in 5-10 years.  There are no guarantees.#Machine learning is not desirable in areas where you want specific hardcoded processes, which covers most of what we do.

I don't know a ton about Info Sci, but ORIE (my major) can be applicable to data science although there's more of an emphasis on statistics and optimization.  I'm pretty sure I've seen some things for a Data Science Club. I wish I had heard about it before I graduated.#Info Sci is the first one that comes to mind for general application. Statistics is another one that comes to mind, though I'm not sure how much it would go into big data.  I believe there is a Cornell Data Science club on campus. At least, there was when I was an undergrad.#Statistics, CS, and ORIE are all good options. Computer Science has vectors (think concentrations) and there is a Machine Learning track within AI if that's what you're more interested in. There's also a Databases route. I'm an active member of the Cornell Data Science  Club so can confirm it exists. We mainly engage in semester long machine learning based data analytics projects. Please check it out. Membership hasn't been so strong recently  There's a quantitative trading club too. Although I haven't really seen what they do. CDS has a very low barrier to entry unlike other Cornell clubs so no one will turn you away, although depending on your experience you may have to find a project with the best fit.

I'm completely addicted to FM, but I never play it because I stay so busy and don't have the time. I'm in graduate school, and I have a project on Big Data visualization (essentially, the manipulation, analysis, and visualization of very large data sets.) For my project, I wanted to pick a soccer-related dataset and work with it. Unfortunately, there aren't very many great options out there. So, my question is this: If I were to put FM on holiday for say, 50 years, would I then be able to extract the data from the game of the 50 years of soccer that was simmed? Everything from World Cup winners down to assist leaders in League 2? And if so, what format would the extracted data take? Excel files?

One program that's been developed to read the live data in FM is Genie Scout, if you search for that the website which hosts it may be able to assist as it has quite an active following and they may even be able to put you in contact with the author (this may be a long shot). He may be able to give insight into if it's possible to extract the data  My assumption is the data is stored in a large flat data table having used Genie Scout, it should be straight forward to manipulate once/ if you figure a way to extract it Edit: Spelling#I have a 20ish year save of FM currently.

But even more important is what you do with that data.  SO many companies focus on ""getting data"" that they almost over-data themselves to death...causing a situation where they have so much they cannot even make any actionable decisions off of it.  In my opinion, analytics will always be a factor. The bigger picture is really attributing acquisition. With all of the different outlets out there (websites, landing pages, social media, TV, print, etc.) it is important to be able to see what happened so that you can make strategic decisions and quantify ROI. The more granular you can get the better.  What I would focus on is:  -Learning and understanding analytics  -Learn and understand platforms that businesses use  -Learn and understand KPIs (Key Performance Indicators, which are a set of quantifiable measures that a company or industry uses to gauge or compare performance in terms of meeting their strategic and operational goals. KPIs vary between companies and industries, depending on their priorities or performance criteria.)  Data is important, but understanding what to do with it is key.  Let me know if you have any other questions. Hope this helps.  -Rob#[Describing future patterns with today's big data.](http://flarrio.com/describing-future-patterns-with-todays-big-data/)#There will always be a demand for strong analytics capabilities, and judging by our client base its an increased focus among organizations. As someone who works in analytics at an ad agency I've found that the most important thing is being able to translate data into business objectives/insights.

Be able to understand and work with data, but most importantly be able to tie it back to the organization and clearly communicate learnings from that data.  "
datascience;4cvyph;1459521826.0;/r/datascience/comments/4cvyph/undergrad_classes/;Undergrad Classes;[deleted];"I've been a data scientist for only two years, so my suggestions aren't hard and fast requirements and don't represent the views of all data scientists, but I think it's still valuable advice.   First, I want to say that I think your classes look good. For stats, I think Advanced SAS programming is going to be superfluous (from my experience), though a lot of large companies and government agencies still use it instead of R. If I am interpreting the course correctly, AI is going to be heavy on machine learning content, so I think that will be helpful as well. Parallel computing is an important class to take - I do a lot of parallel calculations, and the reality is that for most problems, the computational answer is not to buy a bigger box; it is to rent more boxes. Knowing how to manage that is a valuable skill.  The other thing I would like to stress is that while there are some classes that you need to take and that you definitely need a lot of math, I only have a BA in math and a BA in economics. While at college, I used most of my electives to get a minor in Russian, and I got my master's in nonprofit leadership. I did not take half the classes you are taking, including differential equations, or a single comp sci course, and my intro to programming was Stata. Your coursework seems important, but I got my first job by showing some visualizations I had done at a previous position and then I learned R on the job in my first month or two.  Missing out on a single class can seem like a big deal, and if you have no math experience, yeah - it's going to be hard to be a data scientist. But your coursework decisions really aren't as life changing as it seems, and not learning something in college doesn't mean that you'll never learn it.#You've done a good job loading up on the technical skills you'll need to be a data scientist! However, I honestly think you need more than that to be a good data scientist.  I came to data science from a Sociology/Poli Sci background (lots of stats, not much advanced math or CS), so I think I have a slightly different angle on this than other people, but the technical work is really only part of the job. It's also largely a matter of business acumen, presentation skills, and being able to understand and scope a project to solve a particular problem. The stats classes will get at some of that a little bit, but you should also consider at least a couple business classes, project management classes, or even domain classes in an area that you find interesting. Context is important!#At a glance, Computational Science (mainly parallel algorithms) does not seem necessary.  You are missing Machine Learning or Data Mining (Maybe as an independent study if your school doesn't offer a course?).  Focus on R and not SAS as most Data Science positions are rooted in open source.    This looks fairly well rounded, but as I am not a Data Science (I just dabble), I don't have any further advice."

cscareerquestions;4dwswu;1460128121.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4dwswu/accepted_a_software_engineering_internship_but/;Accepted a software engineering internship, but might have an offer for a full time Data Analyst position. What should I do?;So last week I verbally accepted an offer for a software engineering internship (10 weeks full time, paid, 22/hr).  While waiting for the written offer to arrive, I interviewed at another place for a Data Analyst position and was called back for a second interview next week.  It's full time, and I'm thinking it will pay somewhere in the range of 45-50k + full benefits and 5 weeks paid time off (pretty decent for my area, I'm not in some crazy expensive region like the Bay area or NYC).   I'm thinking that I could be getting an offer from this company, the first interview went well.  I still have one semester of school left after this (graduating in December), and I think the company offering the full time position is willing to work with me for that, as my classes would be mostly at night anyway.I'm conflicted as to what I should do:  on one hand, I have a solid internship lined up for the summer, that pays way better than the job I have currently, and is more in line with what I want to do (I went back to school specifically for programming/software engineering), and I'd have to renege on the offer, but at the same time, a real full time job is hard to turn up.  And, I'm not against a big data type job, I just didn't necessarily see myself in those shoes when I went back to school.  It could be lower stress/pressure than doing a programming type job, which might fit my personality better.  I'm just a little conflicted and was wondering if anyone could provide some insight.;go with which ever job better fits your long term career goals and which job will help you get that next job better.#Just as an aside, if you look at the math, your internship will pay about as much as the full-time (they're close enough that over 10 weeks, the difference is pretty negligible).  And generally speaking companies that transition their interns into full-time also give them a compensation boost.  Just something to consider.#I'd keep the internship and finish out your degree.  Tell the analyst company that you're interested in the position, but you're not able to start until after you graduate.  If they really want you, they'll hold the position.  If not, there will be other offers.

datascience;4ehyda;1460492018.0;/r/datascience/comments/4ehyda/question_about_data_frames/;question about data frames;I script all the time in R and Python and was wondering how data frames compare to other data types memory and processing wise. Is the resources need for them higher? Are they slower to iterate through? And would you use them for very big data sets. The biggest data frame I probably ever used was 100mb. When you get to gbs or tbs are they still viable? ;Data frames in R are essentially lists of vectors.  The vectors (one for each column) can all be different types.  R will iterate (including using the apply commands) much more quickly through matrices than through data frames.  A matrix contains data all of the same type, and so the processing overhead is lower.  I regularly use R with multi GB data frames (50 GB +), and it works fine.  Although I would recommend you use the data.table package instead, as it's much more efficient in aggregating larger data sets.  I may be wrong, but I'd be surprised if vanilla R would cope with a TB data frame.  Even if you have the memory on your server, I would expect the performance to be poor.  R is still not good at utilising more than one core of a processor.  Certain packages use Java or multi-threaded BLAS libraries to use multiple cores, and Microsoft R uses a multi threaded BLAS library for matrix operations (although I tried it, and I'm not sold on the performance).  But in the main, operations are single threaded - not ideal for processing significant quantities of data.  I love R.  But it's important to use the right tools for the right job.  If you're processing multi TB datasets, you should probably use something else.

I know i can do this using the above code but I've read this is bad practice so I can only think of another way to solve this problem:    x = 3    def inc(num):        return num + 1    x = inc(x)    print(x)Is this the right way?A thing that bothers me about the ladder solution is that if x was some kind of big variable, wouldn't I be creating a redundant copy of x inside the inc function which might mean a lot of time if x was some kind of big data?;Passing to a parameter to a function doesn't copy it. It just binds another name to the same value.

I was wondering what are my chances of breaking into ML given my background. If it's possible, what's the best way to learn ML for someone with an already decent math background for it?Then, what should a side-project include which would require me to learn everything that a professional ML person would know. ;"ML jobs are a bit chicken and egg: If you really are any good, you don't need to work for someone else haha.  Seriously, speaking as a ""ML Professional"", an employer will look at your coding skills and in particular your ability to program fluently in R, Matlab/Octave etc and pertinent maths and visualisation libraries. Evidence of competency in these langauges should also highlight your ability to handle and manipulate data. Cleaning and pre-processing data is just as important as the throwing maths at it. Unix experience is generally preferred imho.   Be careful when throwing around terms like ""strong math background"", Maths is a lifetime of total dedication. Same goes for terms like ""neural networks"", ""deep learning"" and ""genetic algorithms"" if you're going to throw these around make sure you know more fundamental stuff like ARMA, GLIMS, Gaussian Process, MCMC, simulated annealing and so on. Otherwise you look like you're trying to run before you can walk.  Big data, NLP and deep learning are reasonably popular right now... In fact everything is hot right now. There's money flying at every angle you can think of.  #I'd say, very very high. Specially if you can program well.#Don't know if this would help?

The program seems fairly new, but presented good enough facts for me to consider. Considering the place is in one of the most expensive parts of canada, I need some advice regarding living arrangements.* I am an international student from India, what do you guys recommend, off campus or on campus housing?* I found Hamilton Hall prefers Grad students and the rent seems less or equal to what seems to be available off-campus.* The meal plan option looks lucrative too, I saw a couple of youtube tours and it looked very nice. But I am on strict low carb diet, I am doubtful the dining hall would be able to cater to my diet plan, but I may be wrong. Also the grad rooms have their kitchens so no big deal i guess.* The on-campus aquatics center and gym seems like a great opportunity, I am an avid swimmer and would like to make use of this. So I guess living on campus would give me freedom to enjoy these activities?* Travelling would be out of the equation if I opt in for on campus option, I can keep a bike for moving on campus, I guess.This seems to check out all the requirements I guess, but can anyone help me figure out the catch and what I might be missing compared to daily commuters. I have been a daily commuter during my undergrads and was just wondering that this might be betterPS: is the campus smoker friendly?;First, you should join the New Grad Students Facebook Group because there's lots of information there: https://www.facebook.com/groups/sfugradstudents/  **On Campus vs Off Campus**  Off campus you'll be able to find a one bedroom basement suites and maybe save ~$200 per month vs Hamilton Hall, or split a basement suite / apartment with multiple people and save even more per month. I know people paying as little as $450 per month for reasonable housing. The downside is the commute, which can be especially problematic if you need to make 8:30am or 9:30am classes each day. There's not enough buses so you'll often have to wait for several buses if you're trying to make those class times.  On campus you're paying a bit more, will meet more people, but also have to deal with more noise. The graduate residence faces the massive 1st year dorm towers which will often be noisy.   I live on campus, but in the residential development on the east side of campus. Prices there are more expensive than off campus and residence, but it's far more studious than residence.  **Getting Around**  To get around campus most people just walk (it's about 15 minute walk from Hamilton Hall to the Applied Sciences building). If you live in the residential area on campus it can be as little as a 2 minute walk to Applied Science.  **Smoking**  Vancouver in general is not smoker friendly. Smoking rates are the lowest in Canada (~10-15%) and there's large exclusion zones around campus buildings where you're not allowed to smoke due to Health and Safety laws. So you can smoke on campus, and there's special metal umbrella things so you can smoke in the rain, but I wouldn't say it's a smoker friendly campus.  #The Dining Hall can cater to almost anything. You can always get things without the rice, pasta, potatoes etc. If they dont have anything you like, there's a student kitchen area in the dining hall where they provide all the ingredients and you can cook your own meal the way you like!

There isn't really a distributed data class here, some semesters they offer a 194 called Data Science. 186 touches on some Big Data. There might be some new courses out of the info school, or you could take some upper division stats classes. 289A/B also are there but you have to test in.  Andrew Ng at Stanford is doing cool stuff and webcasts his class, so you could watch.    I think asking your adviser this week, or emailing another ML prof might be your best bet. Mess around with some TensorFlow maybe? The distributed ML field is pretty young, so you could get your hands messy! I think the bottom line is that this isn't a mature area like OS so no clear path, you'll have to experiment and do some emailing to figure it out. Hope that helps! #All three courses you mentioned are useful, so it's a question of what you're interested in. Optimization (127) is probably the most directly connected to ""big data"" hype, and is also a cool and useful topic on its own merits. On the other hand, formal probability theory (134) is a solid foundation that will serve you well for an entire career of working with data, and, like most mathy topics, it's much easier to learn in an organized course than to try to pick it up by self-study later on, which might make it a better use of your limited course slots.  You should also consider CS281a, which is (IMHO) the natural direct successor to 189, in that it helps you understand some of the unifying principles (ideas in probabilistic modeling and inference) behind many of the methods discussed in 189, and how to apply those to thinking about new problems. #Everything I've heard about 194 (data science) is that it's really bad.  EE 127 is kind of painful and boring. Not sure if it's worth taking (maybe auditing?)"

I graduated college with a super non-relevant liberal arts degree but have always had an interest in technology.  I ended up taking a position in sales at a MSP/Consulting firm.  I have been pretty successful in my role and my greatest strength is discussing/explaining advanced IT solutions to CEO's/COO's, basically the business side.  I am sick of sales and want to pursue opportunities on the IT side of things.

The MacBook Air has not a Retina display. It comes with a 1440x900p TN panel (which is mediocre regarding viewing angles, colour reproduction and so on). There are $500 Windows laptops out there with a better display. You can only find the Retina display on the new 12 inch MacBook and on the MacBook Pro 13 and 15 (just be aware that Apple still offers a MacBook Pro 13 model from 2012 on their website with a 1280x800p display, which certainly doesn't qualify as ""Retina"").

If you find the time to answer the above questions i want to thank you for helping contribute to the gathering of a small sample set of data to compare to a big data collection.Edit: There are no right or wrong answers here, this is a small data gathering post to compare to a big data set to see if results are similar. ;ill take a shot -  1. Maybe use NYT Lockbox which allows you to submit stuff like this anonymously. Otherwise, use public key encryption - it would allow me to prove ownership whenever I wanted by exhibiting the private key. Maybe never if its too risky, but the option is there.    wait actually - post a link on reddit to the original voicemail on the server if possible, otherwise upload a copy somewhere else and post that. That way, i just need to be anonymous for the short time it takes to post that link - after that its on the internet and theres no getting rid of it :)  2. If it really was authentic, i assume some kind of voice analysis would prove that. I'm not sure what you mean by data generated by a botnet to contradict it.. there is no contradicting a conversation that happened. I guess it can be discredited as a fake but theres not much i can do about that. hopefully further follow up and investigations would bring out the truth eventually.  3. I think i would share it.. Id also try to simply post a link to the original voicemail on the server anonymously - 
bigdata;4eqcy2;1460625854.0;/r/bigdata/comments/4eqcy2/article_politics_in_the_age_of_big_data/;Article: Politics in the Age of Big Data;As the race to become the next President of the United States rumbles on, more and more attention is being placed on how Data Science and Analytics are playing an active role in the campaigns of the respective frontrunners. From social media scraping to audience analytics, and an Artificial Intelligence Twitter account that tweets like Donald Trump, political elections and the data that surrounds them are now inextricably linked. The question remains however: could the use of Data Science and Analytics be the key to gaining a majority, and the keys to the Oval Office, in this day and age? Here are several ways in which Data Science and Analytics have been used in the past to sway the undecided voters, and how politicians in the future might use the technology to their advantage.It was during the 2012 re-election campaign for President Barack Obama that Data Science was first utilised during a large-scale political campaign. Using a platform called Narwhal, which was built in-house, Obama’s team were able to monitor every aspect of his campaign, and more importantly, what was being said online about what Obama said in front of the cameras. In near real-time, the team could see whether a message or action from one of the President’s speeches had been received either well or badly, such as ‘Obamacare’, and advise the President on whether to emphasise a popular subject, or steer clear of a less favourable topic in his next address. Furthermore, Narwhal made it possible to create a map of the US based purely on social media activity around the election, meaning the team could anticipate the strength of support in a particular state by studying mined data, and then targeting undecided voters with pre-scripted phone calls and flyers persuading them to vote for Obama. It is reported that in the year prior to the Election Day, there were 100 Data Analysts running upwards of 66,000 data simulations every day to try and push the Obama campaign forward. Retargeter reported that during the October of the presidential campaign, Obama’s team spent nearly double the amount ($52 million) on online advertisements than rival Mitt Romney. In total, over $1.5 billion was invested in the victorious Obama campaign. If Obama’s victory showed anything, it was that this money did not go to waste. Whether Obama’s widespread appeal and charisma would have won him the 2012 election alone is something we will never know, but the impact of studying the raw data from social media and other sources is something that is now being taken into the 2016 presidential election.So looking forward, how might Data Science and Analytics, and their wider fields, be used to map the political spectrum, and influence voters in the decision-making process? One aspect could be the integration of Artificial Intelligence into speech-writing for political leaders. Could an AI platform analyse hundreds of petabytes of raw data from social media, news websites and blogs, interpret what the majority of a given number of people are looking for from their politicians, and then create a speech from scratch? Will traditional speechwriters become obsolete, or will the Artificial Intelligence struggle to create the necessary emotional rollercoaster that is the basis of any successful political address? Also, will the issue of Data Privacy become a topic of interest with the voting population? Will people stay off social media during election weeks in order to avoid targeted marketing calls asking for their support? Will analysts dig further into people’s internet searches past social media, to try and sway their vote from a study of their online shopping habits or which online newspaper they read? Will presidential candidates be focussing too much on targeting the millennial vote through their predictive analytics, when ageing populations worldwide would suggest that a far larger proportion of people won’t be accessible through social media, making the over 50s vote the most important of all?We’ve posed a great deal of questions here. Much like modern politics, under the shiny exterior of Data Analytics, what lurks beneath is a great deal murkier. One only has to watch a few episodes of acclaimed drama House of Cards to understand the lengths that politicians will go to secure power. While there’s an argument to say that it is just television, how can we be so sure that it is far from the truth? If only one thing it is certain, it is that the use of Data Science in politics is set only to expand, rather than diminish, in the coming years.Chris Pearson is a Co-Founder of Big Cloud (www.bigcloud.io) specialist recruiters in the fields of Big Data & Data Science.For more Big Data and Data Science related articles visit our website or get in touch via LinkedIn or Twitter - @bigcloudteam ;Source?

EngineeringStudents;4eim56;1460500712.0;/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4eim56/help_deciding_internship/;Help deciding internship?;Hey fellow engies,I'm a freshman mechE student who wants to someday build beautiful planes :) I recently got an opportunity to work at an automotive company and travel to their headquarters in Japan! I will be working in their production engineering department as a precision measurement engineer. Apparently, the skills I'll need are CAD/CAM, IoT, and big data. I'm pretty excited as I really wasn't expecting an internship as a freshman. I've also always wanted to travel to Japan so I hope to explore Tokyo on the weekends! However, I'm in a bit of a dilemma as I hope to one day work in aeronautics, hopefully for Boeing, Nasa, Lockheed, Northrop or any other company in aero. While I don't have an offer I was also considering applying for a JPL internship, however, I decided not to as I realized most of the positions were in computer science doing programming which doesn't interest me very much. However, it could help in obtaining future internships with NASA or other aeronautical engineering companies. Should I stick with the internship that interests me or should I instead try for JPL even though the internship may not be as interesting? Also, is it more important to companies looking through your past internships that you did things similar to what you're applying for or simply that you worked at a company that is closely linked to theirs (regardless of what you actually worked on)? Of course, I plan to intern with JPL sometime through my college career (or at least I hope to) as they do have a few positions (often immediately filled by much more qualified candidates) in aero/mech engineering. I just don't know if it should be as soon as possible (this summer). I would really appreciate some advice. Thank you!;"Congrats on the internship, that's a pretty sweet gig right there!  You will be more favorable to companies if you intern within the industry you want to work in. It's still possible to get into aerospace even if you don't get an internship in that industry; you'll have to do more networking on your end. #Current JPL intern. JPL does not build planes, so nothing to offer there. As a freshman you will have very few skills to offer any company unless you have done extensive self-teaching outside of the classroom. I would stick with what you have as it sounds like you are interested. In the future, JPL is very heavily programming focused, but there are IoT based projects (which ironically involve extensive programming in addition to electronics work), and some hardware-based internships. JPL is more robotics and misc research, but I have found the internship I am participating in to be extremely fun and intellectually stimulating. Your mileage may very! Good luck, and congrats on getting an internship your freshman year."

Both of the interships are paid the same ,with the same amounts of hours per week , that's not what interrest me anyways . The point of this intership is my self-developpement .Edit : I forgot to tell , my prime factors are money , evolution (in terms of career/jobs)  and the job itself (I would prefer working on stuff that interrest me ) . Which brings me a question, won't Big Data/networking jobs pay more (if they don't already ) than coding jobs in the next 5-20 years?After that 2 year undergraduate degree I plan on doing  a master Degree of Software engineer and I will specialised my self depending the outcome of the internship. Thank you guys for reading my post.";"it sounds like you have a good idea about what you want!  computer science is a huge topic and networking is only 1 part of that.  but you have the right idea, developing a specialty/focus is important to your career. i'd say that a lot of the really good money is available in the ""back end"" or ""low level"" stuff so getting close to the hardware and learning about operating systems, networks, databases/SQL, and systems applications is useful."

Thanks.Hello... very new to Access and hoping there is an easy answer to this given time issues... Also hope this makes sense as it took me some time to even figure out how to ask my question...I have a database (of course handed down to me) with multiple tables. Table 1 has the primary ID (for example ""Company#"") and a few basic demographic-type columns, to which all other tables associate. However, most (but not all) of the remainder of the tables have a secondary ID (or what I want to be a secondary ID) as well (for example, ""Division#""). Most companies, however, only have 1 division, but a significant minority have multiple divisions.I have some tables that are division specific (ie, the record/data is accurately identified only by both company and division ID, which are in the table as columns) and some tables that are company specific (ie the record/data applies to the whole company, and therefore all divisions, and only company ID is in the table). These subsequent tables (ie, not table 1) all refer to the exact same set of companies/divisions, but contain different bundles of information (perhaps better as one big data sheet, then queried? but not what was given to me).So example numbers, 400 companies, 500 divisions. Most tables have 500 records, some of 400 records, all refer to the same set of companies and divisions.My questions are:1) How do I set up the relationships so this is accurately reflected?2) Will doing #1 fix my attempt at a form: I tried pulling specific columns/data across multiple tables into a form for ease of editing, but noted that my record # more than doubled, and this was specifically because of companies with multiple divisions (example, instead of having 3 records for a company with 3 divisions, I instead had 244 records instead of 3.3) Am I even asking the right questions? Am I missing something?Again, hoping this is a quick and easy... but doubt it =). Would even help if you pointed me to a good ""relationships in Access"" resource  tried a few things but didn't seem to specifically address what I think is the conundrum.";"If I'm understanding your description correctly, you've got a parent Company table that has many child tables to which it relates (""division"" tables with different bits of info).  Your company table has a Company# field. Provided that there are no duplicate company entries allowed in this table, make sure that the Company# field is the Primary Key for this table.  Each table to which the Company table relates should have the Company# field. The Company# fields must have the same properties in each table. Those tables should have their own Primary Key fields as well.  For instance, if a Company may possibly have more than one Division, then you can have a separate Division table. The Division table has a Primary Key field like Division#. The Division table would also have the Company# field.  In the database Relationships Manager, choose to show the Company and Division tables. Click on the Company table's Company# field and drag to the Division table's Company# field. This opens a relationship editor window and should detect that you're trying to create a one-to-many relationship between the two tables. This type of relationship allows each individual record in the parent table to be linked to multiple records in the child table. (The order of clicking and dragging matters: go parent to child.)  Here's what your Relationship Manager can look like: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/0jv8ZjU.jpg)  It's the same principle for relating the Division table to any number of ""sub"" Division table children.  I'd start there and see how the database you've inherited is set up. Good luck.   "

I currently work in IT as a Helpdesk Tech/ user-facing IT person for the company I work at.  I actually got the job a week before I was accepted into the Master program, so I deferred the Masters for a year to see how I liked IT. I found that really like it.  The Masters sets one up for a Big Data Analytic role, Cybersecurity, IT conultant, Enterprises systems (SAP) or a Healthcare IT roles with a track system.  I'm vacillating between trying for an on-campus job or trying to do something more IT related part time in the local area. Any thoughts?;Have you talked to your current job to see if they can accommodate a part time or off-shift resource? Only two weekdays a week is not a lot to work with for any PT position. I would personally want you on 2nd shift or working weekends to try and get about 30 hours of work out of you anything less than that isn't worth my team's time to have on board.  Your best alternative is retail space or on-campus. They are the only ones that immediately come to mind able to accept ~16 hours of availability or offer weekend/evening options.

While FGS does not model hidden variables that cause two or more measured variables, an upcoming release of another algorithm will do so.FGS is available as a command line implementation (Causal-cmd) that calls a local Java library or as a Java web application (Causal-web) that runs the analysis at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center  the API’s can also be run through R (R-causal) or Python (Py-causal). Additional details and instructions for downloading both these versions of the software are available at http://www.ccd.pitt.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Tools_and_Software.Our goal is to help the biomedical community use causal modeling to gain novel insights and drive innovative research, so we hope to make these tools as usable and useful as possible.  We welcome any and all feedback that you might have, which will help us improve this and future releases. ;

I need career/ graduate school advice.;[deleted];">Thanks,  Logan  First piece of advice: never put personal information on reddit, you never know who could end up reading these posts.  If you want to become a quantitative analyst, you are much better off going to the graduate program in Statistics. The reason is simple: you will be doing some heavy computation and employers want to see a graduate degree in a technical field.  If you want to get into the quantiative aspects of finance you are much better off with a quantitative degree. Reason being, there are way more mbas than their are degrees in STEM. If you want to ""network,"" feel free to go for an mba or masters in finance. However, those degrees are incrediblely overpriced.   >Should I bother with graduate school at the moment?  Depends, how much applicable experience do you have? Have you done any interviewing yet. Obviously it would be preferable to go straight into the workforce in your career field of choice, but that is not always possible. Especially, if you are not willing to relocate.   My personal advice is go to the cheapest state school you can find if you do decide to go to graduate school. With the key being make sure you get an internship, that is the most important consideration."

But the data keeps falling off the back of the truck, or is released by some august governmental body, or sneaked out of the country on a mislabeled compact disc.

Is there anything specific you were thinking of?  > I plan on learning Dutch as soon as I decide to go but I'd like how difficult/easy is it to get a part-time job in Amsterdam or at the University.  Several possibilties:  * There are some jobs you can get in tourism without speaking Dutch but there is a lot of competition for those jobs. * Assuming you are a good programmer, you could make better money freelancing as(for example) as web designer but it might be hard to get connections. * There are occasionally vacancies for student assistants, which are usually offered to students who have shown to be among the best in their class.  > Post-graduation, how is the job market in Amsterdam ? The information on VU says that most of their graduates have jobs just before graduation. How accurate is that ?  Good students usually have no problem finding a job. In fact, often the best ones go abroad to companies like Google and Microsoft or continue to get a PhD.  > How is the living situation ? I guess I'd receive help from VU (maybe UvA too).  With help it should be fine. Without it is very difficult.

Read the abstracts if you don't have much time, and see which are about topics that interest you. Then read those ones very carefully, mainly the Method section to see what exactly they did and how. You can't choose a topic out of your head, you have to research what has already been done, how, why, and what would be useful to your field for you to do.

MachineLearning;4cq8eb;1459434361.0;/r/MachineLearning/comments/4cq8eb/causal_discovery_software_available_for_big_data/;Causal Discovery Software Available for Big Data Analysis;Causal Discovery Software Available for Big Data Analysis The Center for Causal Discovery (CCD) (www.ccd.pitt.edu) has released the Fast Greedy Search (FGS) algorithm (an optimized version of Chickering's Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm) for use by biomedical investigators who are searching for causal associations in large sets of continuous data.  A technical paper describing the optimization is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07749.  It is available as free and open source software. This release is just the first step toward providing a suite of algorithms that will assist biomedical researchers in analyzing their data to obtain causal insights.  Using simulated data, FGS was able to learn a causal network on data containing 50,000 variables and 1,000 samples in about 15 minutes on a laptop computer. While FGS does not model hidden variables that cause two or more measured variables, an upcoming release of another algorithm will do so.FGS is available as a command line implementation (Causal-cmd) that calls a local Java library or as a Java web application (Causal-web) that runs the analysis at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center  the API’s can also be run through R (R-causal) or Python (Py-causal). Additional details and instructions for downloading both these versions of the software are available at http://www.ccd.pitt.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Tools_and_Software.Our goal is to help the biomedical community use causal modeling to gain novel insights and drive innovative research, so we hope to make these tools as usable and useful as possible.  We welcome any and all feedback that you might have, which will help us improve this and future releases. ;
