This means that their work was absorbed by my group. I did what I could to make the work mine, even though it was quite different. Can't go into much detail but the work has to do with clinical trials. Luckily I was able to take on trials that were just data entry. I have managed to clean it up fairly well and by this time next month, we will have no outstanding reports! I'm pretty proud of myself and am working on my next big data cleaning project. Apparently my manager is proud too. She's told me that she's very thankful. This has been one-on-one praise. While a little embarrassing, it also felt really nice! However, when she raised the subject of giving me a big kudos in front of the entire research group (meaning EVERYONE working in our section of the department) I hurriedly asked her to include the rest of my team members because they've been doing work. She caught onto the undertones of my request: please don't single me out! I'm not very good at receiving any kind of positive feedback in front of large groups!! A few weeks back, one of my team members gave me a kudos that was read out loud at the meeting and I blushed super red and stammered a thank you. Anyone have any suggestions on how to handle getting kudos, positive feedback, and praise in a large group setting? The management wants to incorporate this kind of thing at our staff meetings but I'm not sure I can handle it! I'm working on it but I'm only finally getting comfortable in a small group (2-4 people) not 10+.;I wouldn't worry, as long as you don't act insulted and act somewhat thankful then everything will be fine. It's okay to be a little nervy, I think many do feel so in this situation.#I think people appreciate a half smile followed by short eye contact and then you're free to look and the ground or to the side. The half smile and half eye contact is enough for people to see you heard and responded to the praise so they don't think you're being a dick.

hadoop;2ext8e;1409335902.0;/r/hadoop/comments/2ext8e/want_a_job_in_hadoop_admin_and_later_on_in/;Want a job in Hadoop admin and later on in developer, what's the best way to go about this?;http://www.hadoopcareer.com/index.php/hadoop-training/hadoop-for-non-java-programmers I was thinking of taking this course. I recently took some a SQL/Python programming courses and was curious about cloud programming, machine learning, and linguistics. I don't have a formal cs background, but have had in interest in programming computers (ie familiarity with some linux distros) throughout my life, but unfortunately poor direction.  I was curious, without initially learning Java (hopefully learning it later) could I take the above course and easily translate it into a job as a Hadoop admin? It includes some Pig, and Hive. I am curious can I get an entry level Hadoop job without knowing Java or much programming (ie just finished the Learn Python the Hard Way course)? How often do you guys write your queries etc in Pig/Hive vs Java? Why not just use a Python wrapper?Are there any good courses, certifications or tracks someone with a largely non-programming background can take to set themselves up for a job at a large company (ie Amazon's AWS) Google with this new technology? I live in the north NJ/NYC area.EDIT: I've read about a few interesting startups on techcrunch etc regarding Hadoop. My question with them though is what LARGELY is so special about them. Do they involve new EE technologies, top of the line developers, or a new business strategy?If asked what makes me excited about Hadoop/Hive and big data it is the cloud. There are so many possibilities. My ultimate job down the line would be managing healthcare (ie genetics), working for Sugar Sync which allows you to incorporate ANY windows base data structure into the cloud, or for NASA searching for life on other planets.Can someone help me dream?;Developing for Hadoop and being an Admin for a Hadoop cluster are two very different beasts.  If you want to be a Hadoop admin here are some skills I think you need:  Qualified SysAdmin(usually Linux) for DNS,SSH,Mail,etc   Centralized package installation(Yum,YaSt,Apt,etc) and configuration management(Puppet,CFEngine,etc)   Kerberos   LDAP/AD   SAN/NAS/Filesystems   If you want to be a Hadoop developer here are some skills I think you need:  Qualified Programmer(Usually Java) for Map/Reduce implementations   Working SQL knowledge    Data warehouse principles (Kimball,Inmon,etc)   Experience developing either ETL or Analytic applications    #You could use Python, or almost anything else, but Java is the most popular. A lot of courses for teaching Hadoop use Python to make learning easier (Cloudera's tutorials do this, as an example).

In different areas different tools are used but it's already being pushed. Most notably NHS England have been offering financial incentives to GP practices case find high risk patients to actively case manage.  Usual algorithms involve hospital data on A&E, emergency admissions and outpatient attendances being mixed with GP practice data about who is on a disease register (if they have hypertension, asthma or whatever). One tool which is particularly advanced (ACG-adjusted clinical groups) can identify ""emergent risk groups"" and was developed in America for the purposes of insurance premium calculations.  There is NO conclusive evidence it works as yet. All it is is pro-active case finding. In the incentive schemes most of the patients are already known to the practice it just gives them some cash to actively manage them.  More advanced algorithms use GP information on prescriptions and other interventions. They fall down because GP practice data is rarely coded properly-there are exceptions but most GP practices will not invest in admin staff to code unless there is a financial incentive to do so (payment for patients on disease registers are standard for example).  Recent changes to information governance and Caldicott guidance have meant some areas are not being allowed to run risk stratification depending on how local bodies interpret the guidance. No one has asked patients if they want this to happen to their data and unfortunately it's not like tesco where people just have to tick a little box saying ""I refuse to let my data be used in this way"". This would be a huge change in patient rights to privacy and there is no money for a national consent survey in the NHS right now-at least NHS England and the Department of Health aren't planning one. Additionally if you did ask people it is likely more people who need proactive care in the next 10-20 years (mainly over 60 year olds because they cost the most) will refuse it because they won't understand it.   I see the potential but if I'm honest the way things are going there probably won't be an NHS to get the long term benefits from health promotion interventions (like saying you can save 10 years through not smoking or whatever). By then it'll all be private/health budgets UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!  Source- I work on a risk strat project in the NHS and go to boring national meetings about information governance sometimes  TLDR: risk strat is happening already, GP practice data is a weak link, NHS has rules about data use, NHS doomed"
