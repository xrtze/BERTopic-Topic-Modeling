cscareerquestions;dfetdb;1570614819.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dfetdb/i_dont_like_working_in_cs_but_i_really_liked/;I don't like working in CS, but I really liked studying it and coding. What job would best suit me?;"I studied STEM for five years to get a Masters in Computer Science (scholarship), and I've been working now for two years as a Software Developer.In those two years of working, I've found out that I hate working in the area with a passion.Oh, I still love writing code and programming. But working in a company: there's something about taking something I love, a hobby, a passion, and seeing it corrupted by company people that just want to use it for money and only care about low-ball budgets and deadlines. Working in software development has ended up being completely different to what it was like studying it. The people are different. Instead of being around bright-eyed gee-whiz nerds, I'm surrounded by (snake oil) salesmen and managerial types that love to twist the words said by technical folk. I also consider my work unethical and I'm disgusted with myself for what I do. I found a job as a Full Stack Web Developer. Everything is REST APIs these days. And I'm working on web application systems that use REST APIs to on-sell your browsing interactions, so that everywhere you go you can be stalked by big data and machine learning-generated ads of what you just viewed.I hate my life now, and I can't understand how it turned out this way.Is it just that I'm in the wrong area? Maybe working for ""The Company"" or Web Development is not for me, although it's where all the jobs and big money are - at least it seems in Australia/NZ.What sort of CS job would recapture the feel of what it was like in university - coding for coding's sake, and being with like-minded tech nerds pushing each other to be the best?* Should I be aiming for specific companies for my next job? Are there companies with that sort of culture, like Microsoft, Adobe, Google? * Would academia jobs better suit me? But I found, doing postgrad, that it was also heavily bureaucratic (spending more time fighting for grants and gaming paper publications to ""publish or perish"") * Are there certain areas of work that would better suit me, e.g. instead of Web Development specializing in Computational Graphics?";"It sounds like you might want to try and find a more tech focused company, or perhaps a startup or a smaller business. They would have fewer issues like what you describe, at least in my experience.#My recent chats with people who've done academia have scared me away. It is all beurocracy, almost impossible now to get tenure, and just as much of a rat race, but with lower wages. I know of a (one degree of separation) professor who refuses to be a mentor for PhD students because he believes the career path for them is unethical. This is in Canada, which I don't imagine is too different from Aus/NZ.  I do think this is a matter of culture fit. Has this been your only job out of school? Look for another one. Talk to your network for leads and try to talk to the devs who interview you about the things you're concerned about.   I have had the pleasure of working with some pretty hardcore nerdy types, and it's been great! I've also watched bad management decisions crush our spirits and break the team apart as everyone hit their breaking point one after the other and left. This was at Amazon. Many of us are still at the company and have found shelter at various other teams who have better management.   So it all depends on teams and managers. Don't be afraid to move around.#Similar experience working for non-tech company.  Switched to a tech company. Much better. Also much higher pay.#Avoid startups which are intended to be sold/""exited"". Avoid corporate environments.  I work at a consulting firm which is effectively a satellite research lab and it's probably where someone like you would thrive.  Don't do webdev. Webdev is not about making interesting things unless you're an arthouse or something. It's about making *engaging* things that are good at getting money from people.  Graphics programming sounds fun, explore what options there are!#Transition into a different specialty. I was in a similar place, surrounded by code monkeys and managers. I switched to computer vision, got a job, and I've enjoyed life ever since. You're the type of person who needs to be working on interesting problems, and you won't find hard problems doing web dev. Big data, machine learning, computer vision, etc all have interesting problems to solve.#Find a company that is using data to meet a mission you agree with. I worked for a large financial institution out of college that got by just through pushing numbers in the background that people didn't even think about. The work was pretty dull, I tried my hardest at it and worked to enjoy it, but had to admit that what was being done felt absolutely pointless outside of the context of the company.   Find companies with interesting clients, or interesting purposes. Maybe they are looking to make life easier through automation, maybe they are looking to revolutionize integration and testing, maybe they are supporting a cause that means a lot to you. But don't work for generics, companies that are leveraging stacks to meet their internal process needs and that's, that work is soul sucking.#This is something I have struggled with and finally found a place with high-performing, like-minded people who just like tech.  Some aspects may never go away - at the end of the day when you work for a business they are trying to make money, and if it’s not a tech company it gets worse because they also don’t know and care about tech.  I had to finally accept there are parts of any org I may disagree with and focus on finding a great team to work with.  When you look for your next job, interview them as much as they are you - ask to meet the team you will be working with, and set your standards for the type of people you want to work with.  It might take a few tries and no place is perfect but there are solid software teams out there, you just have to find them.  Best of luck!#[deleted]#Go for higher education. You'll always have the opportunity to work with Google, Microsoft etc as a research scientist provided that you maintain an excellent profile, then you'll get to research really interesting stuff and there will be much less intervention of bureaucracy/micromanagement. If you stay in academia, you'll still be able to interact with students and teach them Computer Science concepts which you seem to relish.#""""""The people are different. Instead of being around bright-eyed gee-whiz nerds, I'm surrounded by (snake oil) salesmen and managerial types that love to twist the words said by technical folk. """"""  My experience and dissapointment exactly. With the exception of some bigger companies I imagine, Tech is the shystiest, most full of shit industry, now that business people have got their claws on it.  Either go with it and try to wrangle some joy out of it, find a biz that isn't like this which is probably not easy, or switch to something less fucking Shysty.  That being said the in my experience so far the tech industry is an absolute shit show for a tech person working in the industry.#Where there're people, there're bureaucracy/politics/profit motives. No one field or company is immune. That's the bubble bursting reality that all adults have to face.  Passively, you can pick a group with pleasant people to work with. Most large company jobs are hit or miss depending on the immediate group, if the immediate supervisor/teammates are good, your workday will be at large pleasant, until any re-org, at which point you change job.   Actively, you need to be part of the change you want to see. A good work environment is unfortunately not granted, and if everyone acts like let it be someone else's fight, I just don't see a good end to that strategy.#Have you held any full time jobs before this? Because what you're describing, other than the unethical part, is the crappy part of just having a job. No matter where you go there will always be managerial types. No matter your profession there will always be corporate wanting a deadline. It's all part and parcel to having a full time job. I'm not sure what you expected going into CS.   There is a point though where you should cut the line. You need to double down at work and let things glance off you like oil and water. There is a line in the Sand. Figure out that line for yourself. I've seen many talented people end up not working in their field of study. I worked with a few back when I was a line cook with your exact story. Most of them were smart in school. They got great grades. When the real world hit them though they got afraid of doing the hard work they had to do to get where they want to be. So they ended up a line cook in their thirties because they made some stupid decisions.#So long as you're coding for a salary, you're not coding for coding's sake, and you'll never feel like you are. You felt that way in university because you didn't need to earn a wage to cover basic necessities like food or a roof. The fact that you need to earn money to cover those needs now inherently means you're going to have to make sacrifices from your ideal conditions, and employment is essentially a balance between the resources of the employer and the ambitions of the employee. Look for a better job (if tracking is morally objectional for you, you need to get out of webdev, potentially softeng too, and pivot towards low level hardware coding), but recognise that you're never going to find one that recaptures the feeling of being a student. You're not a student any more.#You can be an academic, since you have a master's already.   Maybe find companies that are working on areas that interest you, ML or whatever else. Also, there's a lot more to CS than development work, even in a company. You can be an architect, manager, work your way up to CIO, there's lots of things you can do without writing code.#You don't need to switch industries to be happy.  Sounds like you need to try your hand at a different company.  Don't go to a Microsoft or a Google, or you'll see the same problems.  Find a small company or startup.    If you need any minimum level of stability, look for a late-stage startup that has an established product and work that needs to be done.  You'll have less bureaucratic hoops to jump through, but will be able to do lots of meaningful work.  You'll still have the day to day boring tasks, but anticipating the cool stuff will get you through those.  If you're ok taking risks, you might enjoy working at an early-stage startup for little to no salary but a ton of equity.  You'll get a ton of opportunities to work on cool and interesting things, but you'll also be under massive amounts of pressure.  The down side is that the boring work still does exist, and you'll be under pressure to do that and the exciting work in the same tight deadline.  Some people thrive in that environment though, and it's up to you to find out if you're one of them.  Honestly after a few years of the startup thing I realized there was a lot I missed about the big company jobs.  You might hit the same thing.  Right now I'm at a late stage startup and still thinking it's the best mix of work/life balance with interesting, rewarding work.#If you have ideas, and I know this sound like a drag, start your own company. Doesn't have to make a huge amount of money but it will make it so you can do what you love in your own way without any bullshit or questionable ethical dilemmas. There are so many people like you who are sick and tired of corporate bullcrap and morally corrupt businesses. Start a good business like that and I guarantee that you will have a line of people wanting to work for you. You can even do it on the wide side while you work and grow it slowly until you dont need that original job anymore.#Dude, life is short, just follow your heart. Go crazy, try something you never thought you would work in in a million years. Go into finance, sales marketing, start a business, become a professional mma fighter for all it's worth. The world is your oyster m8.  But u/vainstar23 you ask me, I already dedicated my life to the arcane arts of computer science! I simply must continue for it is my destiny!! Nonsense, if you are unhappy try something new. Don't fall for the gamblers dilemma where you feel compelled to continue investing in something that's going nowhere. Besides, you can always come back to it tomorrow. Nothing is lost at the end of it.  On the contrary, taking a break and working on something different actually helps you grow as a person. It makes you more interesting and offers a new lense of how to look at the world. I started life as a bartender, I worked in fine dining, joined the army, became a mechanical engineering apprentice, an executive insurance broker and now I'm a software dev and remained one for the last 4 years. Do I feel like this is the end all? Hell no! And who knows? I could get into something else later. I'm adaptable you know?   Just go for it dude and try something crazy. You can only thank yourself later on.#You might find it more fulfilling to work for companies/organizations building software for a good cause, like supporting non-profits or solving social problems. I'd look up the orgs and causes you care about and see what they've got going, software-wise, and figure out if you want to contribute to what they do in that way.  You can help the orgs directly - some even pay their development/tech/IT staff - or you can join the companies that provide the software they use to make it better. Some of those companies will be just as scummy on the inside as the thing you're doing now, and then maybe it helps you decide to find which of their competitors could best use your skills to become a better solution to the problems you want to help solve.#After I worked for a couple of years, I felt 100% like you (except, what I worked on was ethically worse)... Forget about getting your satisfaction from your work, get it outside of work. Since you work in CS, CS as a hobby is dead. Find a better hobby. Meet some great people, cook, go to the ballet, fall in love and become an interesting person. Go to work so that you can live your life.#Find a start up that interests you. I felt exactly like you and didn't come back around to programming for years. I would have never imagined the enormous difference it makes to work for a company that isn't just trying to make money for the people at the top.#I feel the same way, but I like being broke even less.#Work is about making money.  I couldn't bear to code if I didn't know it was for some type of productivity.  You might have to figure out if you're skilled enough (which I assume you are) to make this a worthwhile job.  It's a comfortable to make comfortable money if you have the skills and aptitude.  IT is there to serve the company.  It's not for the sake of coding.  It's tough, but you might have to change your perspective.#Do you think something like going into Research would suit you more?#You might just want to join a consulting company, not one that is good at marketing online but try and look up the authors of your favorite tech books, see where they work.   I empathize with that shock from working among bright-eyed passionate technologists vs business -people, (but I need them to keep sales up and my husband fed!)#I work for a really small business that is extremley ethical.  My company wanted to stop peoples subscriptions for example if they thought they had paid too much. It was a serious discontent that the owners themselves brought up.   Its the equivalent of netflix after 5 years of paying being like damn this is a good customer lets just give them this service for life now.#Try working for a non internet company? Like an engineering or automotive company.#I like the money it provides me. You're going to have to work anyway, you might never find a job you love, so you might as well get paid well for it.#The deadlines were probably tighter in college than in a work environment and you have to admit you are working for money as well. I would focus on doing the best job you can. If you don't like the environment, find another job.#My advice : find an organization you can work for that gives you purpose and your efforts go to good works. There is a lot of nonprofit organizations out there that need software engineers, web developers, dev ops, and more. Best of luck and I hope you find your spark again!#Well, school is a bit of a bubble and the real world is different.  > Should I be aiming for specific companies for my next job? Are there  companies with that sort of culture, like Microsoft, Adobe, Google?   NOOOO! Not Google. Always understand where a company's money comes from - this will be their priority. Microsoft has many paid business customers, but Google is an advertising company and not a technology one.  >  And I'm working on web application systems that use REST APIs to  on-sell your browsing interactions, so that everywhere you go you can be  stalked by big data and machine learning-generated ads of what you just  viewed.   So, like Google?  I'm working on project management software. I help managers make decisions, visualize where time and resources get wasted... My job gives me pride and fulfillment.   A friend of mine once worked on brain-computer interfaces to help paralyzed people use a computer. The job title? ""Full Stack Web Developer""  Find a company to whose product you'd be proud to contribute.#If you happen to be in Sydney and are in it for the long term, work at Canva.#I had the exact same experience as you back in 2014. I'd worked a ton of software engineering internships and always had an excuse to myself about why I hated work. It took me 5 or 6 different work environments (including the Air Force Research Labs, Big engineering jobs and Startups) to come to the conclusion being a professional software engineer isn't for me. I just want to build cool stuff.  Developer Evangelism ended up being the route for me. I get to make whatever I want as long as uses the tech of the company I work for and I can either write or get a talk out of whatever I'm doing. I still have to deal with the things that come along with working, but having the freedom to create whatever I feel like making is enough for me to enjoy my work.#To me, your job also does not sound exciting. Maybe that's a a factor, the exact role. It does not have a good impact, and it's just imho much more boring than really building, for example, a web application with front-end for users.  I myself absolutely hate hate hate personalized advertising, so I deactivated all tracking and everything. I think if more people knew you could do it, almost everyone would do that. It's just creepy af, in my opinion. It scares the shit out of me when I see something I specifically searched for, in a whole different context/web service. It's really the worst. I don't understand why you have turned it on.#You'll find snake oil salesmen in every industry unfortunately.  You may feel better with B2B products as at least then both you and the client are both doing the 'scamming'. You could also try software aimed at experts such as heavy industrial systems, you'll still find the scammy behaviour but it will be more along the lines of deadlines and pricing than entire feature sets.#Dude, you're in your first job out of school. Chill. You're in the wrong company. Find a different one.#Sounds a lot like a culture fit issue to me. I just left a Big N whose mission statement and general behavior I was totally behind, and the difference between that and previous roles was night and day. I respected the people I was working with, had confidence in *most* of my leadership all the way up through the CEO, and was proud of our products and services.  I know not everyone has the luxury of picking and choosing where you work, so tailor this advice to your situation, but I do want to encourage people to at least give some thought into culture fit during interviewing. Before you go in to interview, look at the company, their behaviors, their mission statements, etc. Look around you when you're there, and pay attention to how the recruiters and other staff act--how people behave, how they treat each other and you. If there are things you're concerned about, *ask* your interviewers: they might have some perspective on it. If their answers don't satisfy you, either don't work there, or go in with a plan for getting out if you don't like it.   As for you OP, already being there: I would encourage you to try looking for work in an organization that matches your values a little better before swearing off the field entirely. There really are good companies out there, in my opinion.#There are non-profits and companies working on climate change, micro loans, lifting cultures out of poverty.  They pay less but they are there. And those non-profits will probably only have small IT teams full of devs that are willing to be paid less but have bigger responsibilities.  So find those companies instead of feeling self-pity and self-contempt.#When I was in college, working for a SCUBA Shop, the owner gave me a piece of advice: Never turn something you love into your job. Because then it’s a job, and no one loves their job. All you succeed in doing is to remove one of the things you enjoy from your life.  Welcome to the real world. If work was fun, companies wouldn’t pay you, you’d pay them#You go to work... to, uh, work.  Businesses are there to make money, not to cater to programmers wanting to change the world or build sleek systems.  It's the same whether you are a carpenter, construction worker, firefighter, or teacher.  As software developers we get above average pay for completing a 4 year degree (or no degree).  We get to sit in comfy, air-conditioned and heated offices, with good benefits, and our only real health concern is maintaining posture and exercising enough.  We have it super nice compared to most workers and people in society.  Software development is literally one of the highest paid fields to get in to with the lowest barriers of entry.  Posts like this just reek of entitlement.  I think you need to really adjust your expectations about life, because I don't think that simply changing your field is going to make you happy.  Your university degree has literally less than nothing to do with real life.  It's merely a piece of paper to flash in front of employers in order to get a job.#> I've found out that I hate working ~~in the area~~ with a passion.  Fixed that for you.  > Working in software development has ended up being completely different to what it was like studying it.  No shit?  You thought you'd be paid to pass tests?  >  I'm surrounded by (snake oil) salesmen and managerial types that love to twist the words said by technical folk.  You mean you are surrounded by salesmen and managerial types who love to translate incoherent technobabble bloviation into words that humans can understand?  And they're getting paid more than you are even though you are several standard deviations smarter than they are and they could never have passed your algorithms class no matter how long they tried.  Makes you wonder whether we are using the wrong definition for ""smart"" here, doesn't it?  > I also consider my work unethical and I'm disgusted with myself for what I do.  If you try hard enough, you can convince yourself that every single job is unethical.  If all else fails, you can always remind the firefighter that saving that orphan from a burning church is unethical because that orphan will not pay his carbon tax and grow up to be responsible for burning oil and destroying the planet.  > so that everywhere you go you can be stalked by big data and machine learning-generated ads  >  Are there companies with that sort of culture, like Microsoft, Adobe, Google?  Where do you think Google and Facebook make their money?  They do what you do, just better and at scale.  > Would academia jobs better suit me?  No.  You'll use your high powered intellect to dissect that industry too, and find reasons to hate it.  > Are there certain areas of work that would better suit me, e.g. instead of Web Development specializing in Computational Graphics?  No.  Work is work.  It's the same shit with different flies.  TL DR - you're just complaining.  Suck it up, earn your living, and find something you enjoy to occupy the other 8 hours of your waking day so that you only have to be aware that you have a job half of the time.#Professional Grad Student!#Stripper.#What do you like working in?#I wonder if working at Leetcode might be like that#Marketting or Advertising for CS companies.#If you're up to it, academia will likely be a great fit for you.#It sounds like you might do better either in a governmental or security contractor position working with the DoD or NSA. Those tend to be more structured and they don't play fast and lose with the rules because it could mean life and death. A medical company would also be a safe bet where things are done the right way. It really just sounds like you don't like the industry you are in.#[deleted]#So I recently had a similar realization. I felt like programming for work is not as fun as it was in school. I found that in school, I was at least learning with each line I wrote. I felt more challenged. In the job, I use the same languages everyday and it’s gotten to the point where I am familiar with the code base so there isn’t much to learn anymore.   As for what job would best suit you, think of what you like doing. Think of any jobs you’ve had and think of how you can take your enjoyment of programming and use it in that field. My husband and I are on a 6 month plan for us to quit our jobs and open a fast casual food place. I plan on using my development skills to build useful software for the business. But just an idea of what someone else is doing.   So yeah, think of what you like doing, and maybe think of a way that development and programming can be used in that field. Best of luck.#Have you considered developer relations job?#Sounds like you should get a PhD and go into research to me. But, you might be better suited to research wings of larger companies than academic research at a university (not as much political craziness to navigate.) That being said, politics are just part of growing a career. There's going to be some you have to stomach. No area you move to will be perfect. But, you'll be a little better suited toward tolerating certain bits than others.     You will, however, need a PhD. Most companies won't hire researchers with less than that.      However, I do heavily suggest you try to find a better environment first. I've been on some very good teams and some pretty dysfunctional ones. I will tell you that, doing the essentially same thing, it is a HUGE shift in ability to tolerate the situation. If you find a company that's focused on immediate profit growth, you will almost invariably be in a position like you are now. You need to find a company who's more focused on a long-term mission/strategy/goal. Those companies tend to value their people more often because they're not focused on ringing the dollars and cents out of every action, but more focused on trying to achieve their larger goal and recognize the people working with them are the vehicle to do that. Culture MATTERS. A lot. Probably as much as the monetary compensation.#Instead of research, why don't you get into teaching at a community/technical college or at a high school?#There are a lot of companies and government organizations hiring that aren't in the business of tracking people.  Just about any research branch of a university that has grant funding hires IT staff to do analysis, every company and government organization needs administrators whether they be cloud based or not, and there are tons of products out there that you'd be hard pressed to find the unethical part of their service.  Start looking for other jobs and when you do, check out their mission statement and what their product offering is.  Don't apply for one that doesn't align with your values.#It's not a job I would recommend, but it's not uncommon for those enamored by the education system to pursue teaching. Have you considered being a professor?#I met a dude on IRC who tries to hire programmers to work for open source companies with potentially useful social value (say energy savings). Would you like that ?#I can understand working with shady people, but there is nothing wrong with selling software for a profit. The software only exists because of a market need, not the other way around. Sounds like you need to find a research position since you aren't fond of the business side of things. Or if you are ambitious start your own tech company that meets your vision.#Not really on your level but I'm a data analyst and I code daily. What I love about it is building my OWN tools usually from scratch. The tools and projects are usually pretty small. I love it because I get to do my own thing. I don't have to work with a lot of other people's code and when I do, I just redevelop the tool to fit my style because the tools are small, it doesn't take much time#I think you're being more than a little disingenuous when you say things like ""... managerial types that love to twist the words said by technical folk..."" Perhaps you are just really bad at communicating.#Look into working for a non-profit perhaps?#You wanna prioritize perfect design, contribute to Open Source. In business, time is money#You could check out the organizations on [Tech Jobs for Good](https://www.techjobsforgood.com) to see if any of those roles/organizations get you excited.   That being said, there are plenty of organizations that have a more tech-focused product and knowing what you want out of a company culture & values will help you find places that are more enjoyable to work for.#There are a lot of other companies in a lot of other industries that need programmers.  For example, a lot of life science companies need programmers to help manage and model their data so that they can better test diseases and save people’s lives.  I don’t think you hate your profession, I think you hate your current job.  And that’s a much easier problem to solve.#I ended up at a late stage startup and love it.  There's business pressures for sure, but the culture is engineering friendly.  I had a shitty experience at my last place for reasons similar to what you describe.  I may have gotten  lucky in this current place, but I can't imagine that there aren't other good companies out there.#My question would be, have you been working for the same company the entire time you have been out of school? Maybe try going to meetups in your local area to understand the culture and drive of other employers. I can completely relate to that passion turning into a ""sell-out"" mentality. I have been there. My advice is to seek community locally and have open discussion with other devs. If you feel like shit about your job, maybe do some non-profit work for the sake of your soul?#If you're willing to work for $32,000 a year, many public libraries need a ""tech guy"" on staff.#Perhaps get into a research position, security research can be lucrative.#It sounds like you work for a company whose mission you don’t agree with. I’d suggest finding a new job. I work at a social impact startup, and I love my job because I feel like I’m doing something worthwhile every day. I’m just as skeptical of big tech as you are — there *are* tech jobs out there that aren’t bullshit.#A counter argument:  You cannot escape deadlines and working with business folk and the reality of having to make 💰. At a job, there is no such thing as just coding for coding's sake.  None of that is necessarily bad. Deadlines (ideally) come from setting goals and having alignment on what you're building. Working with business folk can be really great and teach you a lot of things that just talking with other engineers won't get you. Having to make money means coding something that people actually find value in, versus school projects no one cares about.  You have to learn a lot of other skills besides just coding to make the most of the coding you do. But yes it can still be really rewarding.  Now if you don't agree with your company's ethics and if they're selling snake oil, absolutely quit and find somewhere else. But in general I think you can find a good experience somewhere if you're a bit more open to the non-purely-coding aspects of the job.#Maybe research?#Get a new job man  I'd hate that too#Welcome to the world of work. My only advice would be to try to save as much of your salary as you can and become financially independent. Then you can do whatever you want, start here:   [https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/)#A year ago I decided (together with a colleague) to build a startup. I worked almost 20 years for big companies. I really liked it (otherwise I would not have done it 20 years), but some of my wishes / capacity /drivers I could not really live/address in the way I would like. E.g. am extremely good in creating products, but I also wont to bring them to life (not as programmer, but creating / shaping and leading this process). In a big organization you either be a product manager or project manager. A year ago I realized that for me it is really important to have this combination and also being able to share my knowledge. This is how StartupSpider ([www.startupspider.com](https://www.startupspider.com)) was born (soon we opening the platform for registration, maybe you can use it to find others like you or a Startup that fits).   However, a Startup is not really easy (not in the role as a founder and also not as employee). You have huge time pressure, money challenges and you are your own ""help-desk"". Also it is like a marriage, because you are much closer to each other as in a normal company. Therefore selecting the right Startup / team is important. E.g. I am extremely thankful we all knew each other from before E.g. I have clearly some strengths, but definitively also my negative sides... therefore it is important to know each other and that it fits. Otherwise you will be even less happy as you are today....  I wish you all the best for your future and I hope you find what you are looking for...#I'm not gonna lie, the title confuses the hell out of me. You don't like ""working in CS"" but you work as a software developer and like coding? What do you mean by ""working in CS""? You mean you don't like working as a programmer?#Hop around to different companies  they certainly aren't all the same.  Parts of Facebook and parts of Google certainly have the culture you'd like.      That said, I suspect finding a way to get into infrastructure jobs - instead of front-end - may be a win as well.  Infra doesn't really deal with product managers, or sales, and the goal is quality, not primarily speed-out-the-door.#PHD student and then professor  Or suck it up and realize that most people don’t love their jobs, and significant portion hate them. Hobbies lose a lot of fun when you do them for work. Same thing happens to musicians and artists too.  Get a hobby and look for a more interesting job, but be aware it won’t be like it is in college. Tech companies will be better a place to look.#It's not that you dont like working in cs, you don't like working at all. Grow up and stop being lazy"

The Bittrex International platform is for international customers. Customers who are U.S. citizens, and customers who are located within the United States, will continue to use Bittrex.com, and they will not be able to trade on the Bittrex International platform.  Bittrex International will provide the same overall experience and will allow its customers to access to all tokens and trading pairs that are listed on Bittrex.com  however, Bittrex International customers will also have access to tokens not available in U.S. markets. In addition, Bittrex International offers token teams a streamlined listing process, enabling approvals within weeks instead of months.""  https://bittrex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001426066-FAQs-Bittrex-International-Trading-Platform-  So, what does this mean? The listing doesn't open VET up to US customers (yet), but it's a big step in the right direction.#>New Listing Update: The VeChain (VET) wallet is open and trading will begin shortly on https://international.bittrex.com.

And i still have 110% faith that this market will turn around and all of the loss will be recouped. So I don't want to hear another one of you bitch about price action unless you realized more loss than that lol.

Why would you build on Ethereum which is only going to get slower transactions and doesn't have MPP or VIP191?#VIP191 transactions are fire right now!!!

Compounding return for the win until this think finally takes off in year or two!#I've been following the Blizzard fiasco and stumbled upon this hearthstone-sequel trading card game with NFTs on the ethereum blockchain. I played a few games and it's pretty fun! However they seem to be running into issues with streamlining the process of buying packs and THEN activating the cards to the blockchain. It's clunky and expensive. It would be so much better if they had the MPP capabilities and the low transaction costs that the Vechain Blockchain could provide.  The game itself makes me excited for blockchain based games, but what it's already falling short of makes me even more excited for Vechain! Wonder if they could be convinced to make the switch like Jur did.#This thread has “the hope” phase of the market cycle written all over it#Can somebody give an idea of how large and to what extent this exchange is reputable?

CZ says P2P platform already exceeding their high end expectations on volume. Hoping they add VET to the P2P platform. Will increase liquidity if what CZ says is true. I'll jump on the P2P when VET becomes available there. I'll be honest and say, I am not happy buying VET on OceanEx. Orders don't get filled, lots of trades which don't appear on the order books and wash trading all leave a bad taste.#Do VET withdrawals from OceanEx usually take more than a few minutes?  I have a withdrawal right now sitting as submitted with no txid issued for going on half an hour.#I have been around since end of 2017 I got ruined by the crash like alot of people. My question is do you think 500,000 VET is still enough to be a large amount of value in the future? I have another 500,000 split into some other vet alts but its lower now as they have burned me also so I just wanna know if you guys think 500,000 is a decent stake in VeChain#Damn it wanted to accumulate 1mil vet for around 3500 bucks within a few months. Now it already increased to above 3800 $ (with fees for transfering the btc or eth to the exchange that got VET).  &#x200B   Feelsbadman, tough I'm happy for all you holders for the green numbers recently =)#Waking up and vet isn’t red , strange feeling :)  Also volume on binance around 3 million , it was like 0,6 million a few days ago#How censored do you think we are here in regards to showing support for HongKong?  If Vechain showed support for HK would every Chinese partnership pull out? Would we lose all ground and progress we made in China?  What if someone created a Dapp or something that in some way supported the protests. Could something like this affect my investment and the success of Vechain?  Food for thought.#What's the catch with Oceanex turbo?#Anyone has additional info about twitter account TheresaFinn @bleedtoforget ?  Here her/his post 3 h ago:  got some interesting news from inside the foundation. cant share them public. dont sell your $vet, better buy more as long as its in this price range.  that will change. #news where very huge. it started already.  #vechain #btc #bitcoin #ethereum #xrp #ripple #eth #XLM #stellar#Hmmm, dont wanna be the pessimist. If u go to daily or weekly VET/USD chart this weakish upswing kinda looks like another preparation for a strong downfall. BTC the cause offcourse. What you guys think?"

I know many wine producers and i can tell u nobody is interested in the supplychain atm. Many reasons behind it.  One of the reasons is: Atm we have a small export to China due to our strong connection with USA since II WW (see trade war Trump-Xi) and because in Europe we are considered the brother Fredo of France and Germany (i guess everybody here knows the movie Godfather yes?).  But...  But i know that our Prime Minister - Giuseppe Conte - is well connected with DNV GL - currently all major italian companies in which government have shares are working directly with DNV GL, including ENEL and ENI - two of the biggest. Last year ENEL decided to leave nuclear, coal and gas market behind (i know because i had to go to work somewhere else since i have nuclear background) in order to focus 100% in renewable energy with the new branch ENEL GREEN POWER).  Guys, ENEL its not only in Italy, they control energy sector also Spain, Romania and the whole south America - Chile, Argentina, Perù, Brasile, etc with an annual gross income of circa 70 billions - Btw, Chile govt is already working with BYD and ENEL X- See this::  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-08-09/santiago-s-electric-bus-fleet-cuts-costs-and-cleans-the-air](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-08-09/santiago-s-electric-bus-fleet-cuts-costs-and-cleans-the-air)  Let me close this post saying this:  I heard from my friends in Rome that something possibly related to Vechain,DNV GL and ENEL will be included in the badget law (in italian is called DEF - Documento di Economia e Finanza) for year 2020.  Italian wine producers are waiting for the final call of government to act accordingly.  It will probably take a while (knowing the long iter of italian parliament - 2 chambers - 20 commissions + the President of the Republic, Costitutional court and Corte dei Conti - judges which are asked to evaluate if numbers are sustainable - to approve the document).  Can u imagine guys? We have to pay wages for all these lices in Rome :(  The so called DEF will be officially released in november or december. Lets wait and see what will be included in it.  And Also San Marino obviously is involved - Its the test for us to understand if the system could work in a more complex country, like Italy is.  First --> **San Marino** \--> **37.000 citizens** \--> Then --> **Italy** \--> **60.000.000 citizens**  As Sunny said, everything is connected...  So, do not give up boys.  Here in Italy we say: **Il tempo è galantuomo** \- Or **Things work out over time**  I will continue to read u guys and when DEF will be out i will try to summarize it for u if i see something interesting.#While finalizing my taxes has gotten me a little down from actually seeing how much value I lost in 2018 alone, the universe sent a pick me up. Guess who was just promoted to Senior Developer!? this guy! Now VET stay low until I get my lump sum 2 month backdated raise funds! :)  You stay classy #VEFam#Some nice discussions going on in here today. So damn good to see positive, constructive conversations taking place instead of... you now what. I shudder to say those words out of fear of sparking another debate. Anywayyy.. nice job guys n gals!   On another note, RE: Italian wine/DNVGL  @RGrotolla mentioned that their business of ‘trust’ of a 155 years was threatened by Blockchain.   IMO, They saw Blockchain as an existential threat, AND their savior. In other words, they had a choice to make, which was either fight this new wave or embrace it. A decision needed to be made, and they chose to embrace it with open arms.  They found and bought stake in a company that suits their needs, has the tech to compete, and has the vision that complements their views on business. Make no mistake, DNVGL is ALL IN on Vechain and Blockchain. They will push to have this tech adopted with all of their might. And that means lobbying lawmakers, enterprises, large accounting firms. They have built a network of hundreds of years that spans all of these spectrums. They know the right people. They know how to schmooze, convince, push, and make deals with people at the highest levels. These guys are no joke.   Really interested to see how it all pans out, and excited for the future.#Hello guys,  after my yesterday post about the italian parliament discussing the DEF 2020 (badget law), this morning one friend of mine sent me the draft issued by Consiglio dei Ministri (govt).   To be clear about all steps:  CDM (Consiglio dei Ministri) is the govt table where this draft has been issued, discussed and approved.  Italian parliament will discuss it again in the next 2 months before the final approval, as yesterday said, in december.  I want to clarify also that this draft could be slightly modified in  parliament during the final discussion but the core of the document wont change that much.

I put this image together from some things I stumbled upon last week. (*A news article, a list of partners in the association listed below, and the VeChain slide from a presentation)*  [https://imgur.com/a/1XjVImQ](https://imgur.com/a/1XjVImQ)  On June 25 the Walmart deal was announced with Walmart China, China Chain-Store Franchise Association (CCFA), and PWC and some others.  The China Chain-Store Franchise Association (CCFA) is a Chinese association of **more than 1000 enterprise members** from 60 different industries and sectors. I would think this association has strong ties to the Chinese government.  We have all heard talks and rumors that VeChain could have a link to the Chinese government as well. Also we have recently seen Vechain become more accredited in China as it was added to a list of trusted blockchain companies by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (*more* *government*).  Recently at a block chain summit (I think) VeChain displayed a slide showing ""**1000+ enterprise clients in the pipeline**"" This is the same way the CCFA describes the size of its member base (see above or photo).  I also see that Walmart China seems to be the biggest member of the CCFA. It is listed first when examples of CCFA members are displayed (IE: the list in the bottom of the news article, The first logo in the graphic of CCFA members)  Is it crazy to think that PWC just signed up the entire China Chain-Store Franchise Association (CCFA) on the VeChain deal and Walmart was chosen to go first and is carving the way for the rest of the CCFA members to come to Vechain because it is the flagship member of the association?  If I remember right Jason Rockwood hinted at things like this with tweets.  "" *Instead of signing up one client at a time, we sign up one channel partner who has five to fifty to five hundred clients.    It has the potential to be exponential*.""  He said this right after the Walmart announcement:  "" *\*I am so proud of everyone in the VeChain community who knew about Walmart and didn't leak.  It was massively difficult for all of us to hold this in, and we did it.  Thank you, you know who you are.    (\*****Now guess what other secrets I'm holding in?****)*  Followed by: "" *I should have said the scale of PROJECTS is equivalent or bigger.    Hard to get a bigger client than Walmart. ""*  I would say this could potentially be one big project???  You guys have any thoughts on this theory or observation of mine?#>We will be adding #TeamFortress2 as our third game starting this Friday, 11 October 2019 .

I just spent some time looking at this  [https://visuals.veblocks.net/](https://visuals.veblocks.net/)  explorer posted by a user yesterday. You can clearly see 5 short spikes in activity for the current day. Just doing a quick visual they only seem to last 5-15 minutes each of solid activity.  My quick estimate shows we only really have **48 mins total worth** of solid consistent activity in the 16 hours of today. Basically only seeing activity for **5% of the day so far (16 hours).** So 95% of the time mainnet is just kind of at idle. This is a reminder of how early we truly are in this project.  A solid 33% (one third) of a 24 hour day of activity would be huge. This is still only about 8 hours worth of a 24 hour day. I look forward to these kind of days.  To add to this, I think our first big goal is to **10x from where we are now**. The last 3 days we have consistently seen 100,000+ clauses with a VTHO burn of  about 4.0-4.5 million. If we 10x from here we will see a consistent 1 million clauses a day and VTHO burn on 40 to 45 million. **This is 3 to 8 million VTHO more than the generation rate.** This is where we will start to see real value and hopefully the Utility will start to break us away from the influences of Bitcoin. The only question is how long will it take to get to this point.  Just some things to think about. For now I am going to look at grabbing a few hundred thousand more VET. Hard to not want to buy more at these prices.#210 million VET needs to be bought to get to 42 sats. 216 million VET needs to be sold to get to 0 sats.  To go up 2 sats it takes just as much as to go to literal zero.

Can't get much now-a-days dumping at these low prices.#While the benefits are still questionable. One could pick up an x node from the marketplace for about $1,500 usd  at this rate. Not too shabby considering the usd investment figure originally required to obtain an x node. Only 3 or 4 on the marketplace and only one under 500,000 vet currently. About a month ago they were going for like 700,000 vet (not sure if any sold at that rate)#I want to buy right now.  But what's the point... There's well over 200 million vet at the next 3 sats. Those ain't going anywhere anytime.  Price literally cannot go up right now.#Anyone know what Aqua diamond token(AQD) is?

But it appears there was some action today.  Never change, crypto. Never change.#Out of curiousity, does anyone know how much maintaining VeChainStats cost per month ? I mean, that website is much more insightful than Veforge and I don't see Fabian begging for money ?#https://twitter.com/sunshinelu24/status/1185958456932610049?s=20  1) No doubt, Mass adoption is the way to go and it cannot be done without enterprise level applications which require professional tools and services to support for business continuity as one of top priorities.  2) Community involvement and contribution to ecosystem with business value is still long way to go with professionalism. It’s a must to have in-house built infrastructure support in short term.  3) From long term view, both are really needed to have professional enterprise teams to join community and community startups to be more and more professional even from the very beginning. Won’t stop until the day comes.#The knee-jerk reaction of everyone who is screaming for the foundation to pay Totient and not let this happen is missing a couple major points.   1) Vechain has already supported Totient, so the complaints are disingenuous from the start. Whether it's ""enough"" is a different discussion.   2) A good company is not held hostage by a volunteer developing team like this. Some of you sound like you *want* the company you are invested in to bow to this type of pressure....not prudent.   3) If the foundation did bow to this and begin financially supporting Totient, they would need to get the funding from somewhere. So, you *want* more sell walls?  4) All of this may simply be a purposeful and prudent consolidation of Vechain's marketing efforts. It makes a ton of sense that major features would eventually be in-house.  Edit: Announcement from Vechain came maybe 10 minutes after this post. I am very pleased with how they handled this situation, per the above. Totient Labs is unprofessional and behaved essentially like children here.#There is alot of people worrying about their holdings disappearing with totient closing down.

Take a deep breath.#New Transaction Record  VIP191 :)#I for one am sad to see Toitent go. I've worked in the start up space for many years and there are many things that need to go right in order for a start up to succeed. Pivoting sometimes is key.  100k is nothing in the application development world. Especially in SF, where development is more expensive. For a little perspective the development agency I worked for would charge $175 an hour. I could see the explorer taking around 3 months to build. 3 months is roughly 13 weeks which is about 520 hours. 520 x 175 is $91,000. Some places charge per hour per developer. All that to say, development isn't cheap.  Maybe Toitent had a plan but the plan didn't work out. Maybe they didn't have at all and were hoping VeChains performance was a bit better. Who knows.  Toitent has helped this ecosystem a lot. I wish they were sticking around but they gotta do what they gotta do. I wish them the best!  Also I'd love to work on an open source explorer if anyone is interested. 😉#Totient : we want more money  Vechain : no  Totient : we'll shut it down  Vechain : fine we have our own  https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/announcing-the-new-official-vechain-block-explorer-and-vechain-sync-ledger-wallet-interface-38a4b5360aeb#[deleted]#Quick question.

I saw it a split second and now it’s gone...#Totient labs was great but only giving us one day to move funds is pretty lame#Totient labs.. apparently these guys are good in tech, but not too good in building sustainable partnerships. I understand they've put in some efforts, delivering for the Vechain community. Never the less, Vechain rewarded them accordingly. I really believe they have pulled the short string in this game. I dont think they saw the full futuristic possabilities, maintaining a long sustainable partnership with Vechain.   Time will teach them i guess..#Sneaker Coin may be onto something, it seems to be quite an industry.  https://www.facebook.com/167115176655082/posts/3082433685123202?sfns=mo  (Video doesn’t mention VeChain / Sneaker Coin, but helps provide context on the market)#The real question is  how long will it really take before we get that new open source explorer  )#I recommend everyone download Sync and learn the features and functionalities before the new explorer goes online.

Consulting? What would they consult on? Onloading to the platform or developing solutions on VeChain? Maybe there was not enough business from that end yet and they needed more runway. I'd imagine they would look for more runway or being brought in as 1st party, neither of which happened. It would seem VeChain would not want to 'recreate the wheel' and build on Totient's explorer, but the cost of bringing Totient in-house was too high.#I have all my VET stored on a nano s ledger.

Cost for devs $10,000/month at a minimum.  Run it for 6 months and with no revenue stream it is unsustainable. Maybe what led to the decision to pull out. They probably want to go  the VC route that can get them a few million to keep their lights on.  Edit: Question is - out of the $500 million ecosystem fund, couldn't a couple of million be given to Totient for the great work they've put in so they could keep their lights on and continue the good work? Maybe the bear had the $500 million fund for breakfast.#[deleted]#Does any one know If i have my VET on my VeChain Thor iOS app. Am I okay?

The PBOC will launch a package that combines the central bank digital currency with electronic payment instruments, with the goal to replace part of cash, Yi said.  The central bank digital currency framework will not change the existing currency supply routes and system, he said.  **It will select the best technology in the market through fair competition, involving not only blockchain but also new technologies that evolve from the existing electronic payments**, he said.  If a digital currency is to be used across borders, it must also meet regulatory requirements designed to combat violations including money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion, he added.  As for the launch time, Yi said there is no timetable, as **there have to be a series of moves from studies to tests, evaluations to risk prevention measures.** #Have mpp clauses moved to vip 191 ?#Do I get a medal if I’ve been holding since 2017?

Is their burn separate?#It‘s fantastic. The price stays low and I can still accumulate super cheap for some time. I can‘t believe how lucky I am. (disclaimer: no irony)#I am not spreading FUD. This is complicated stuff and I have a question regarding tokenomics. I know this has been discussed at length multiple times so I’m sorry...   Say for example Business A buys 100VET now. They will produce a specific amount of VTHO that will be used to power 10 transactions a day (for example). When demand for VTHO increases, the price increases and the foundation increases the generation rate of VTHO to stabilize price. Say they double it. That same 100VET produces the  VTHO that can still power those same 10 transactions. Even though the amount of VTHO has increased, the value to the business is still the same and costs the same amount of fiat.   VET increased 10x. Now Business B wants to own VET, and they buy 100VET. They will be paying a 10x multiple of what Business A paid, but will still end up producing the same amount of value for powering transactions as Business A.   My question is, why pay that 10x multiple and purchase VET to earn VTHO. Does it not becomes less and less appealing to buy VET as VET price increases? Say, for example, VET 100x. Are businesses going to buy this expensive token to generate VTHO, or purchase the VTHO that’s doubled in cost rather than 100xVET?#LOUIS VUITTON might be a much bigger deal than previously thought.#Posting this comment seperately to get some good discussion going. This place has been somewhat dead recently.   In response to Paul H. Ponytail and the discussion he started.  There most certainly is a right and wrong in politics. Innocent human death is wrong. Plain and simple. We should be past that, and yet we're still killing each other every fucking day for stupid fucking shit. Oh, your opinion on what happens after we die is different than mine? Well I have a gun so I'ma fucking kill you.  And its a fact that certain political structures allow this to go on way easier than others.   There are things in politics that are right and wrong. Things that cause damage and things that don't. There's a reason that quality of life varies around the world and in different countries and its 100% because of politics. Some countries have legalized drugs and view addiction as a mental health problem rather than a crime, and there's other countries that throw junkies in prison for 30 years. Some countries prison systems are designed to help and rehibilitate the prisoners and others abuse and torture them.  Crypto can do A LOT of good for a lot of these political issues. And there's only 1 way to think about and design solutions for the world's problems and that is to talk about them and educate people about them.   It's not opinion. There is right and wrong. And human rights are at basis of what is right.  As pioneers in the crypto revolution-to-be(hopefully) I think we are all here for 2 things, to make money, and to make the world a better place.  Why do we like Vechain? Why is traceability important? Why do we want corporations to implement traceability solutions? Why do we want to know where our food comes from?   It's to protect ourselves from individuals that put personal gain over the welfare of others. Greed and corruption is the reason there is so much illegitmacy in the origin of our products. Whether food, beverage, clothing, etc, if there is a way to cut costs and sell a shit tier product and make more money, ignorant uneducated individuals will take that oppurtunity.  Tell me policy has no effect on how goods are produced. You CANNOT seperate politics from anything. It's why Vechain exists and its the source of the problem that Vechain is trying to fix. Laws make it easier/harder to throw welfare under the bus for profit.  Rotten on Netflix is a really good doc-series that outlines some of the fucked up shit happening with our food. Tell me politics has nothing to do with it. I dare you."

What i learned in this VeChain Community is, that something has to bring value for the token Prize and that we can determine, at what usage, we bring ""more"" value on the table!  I hear no one talking about real Usage of the coins or facts about the Usage or atleast they never try to explain on this level.   So why is that? And even if they just want a ""higher price"" for a coin? What sense does this make anyway, if you just hold for more money and not for using the tech! Thats a big problem, what  I see in 99% of all existing coins!  I'm glad that i got really critical about all this talkings and promises!  What is ur sentiments? What coins u think will be used in future and not only for selling them?#Looks like 2018-2021 is shaping up to be the foundational period for (public) blockchain. As of 2022, the speed of adoption, in my opinion, will accelerate in such a way to make skeptics' heads spin.   What I'm most excited about is how a lot of blockchain-based services will *converge* together to create much more value than their sum, thanks to interoperability and network effects.   I can't believe that after 2 years of price being pummeled week after week after week... I'm still as excited - if not more - than I was in 2017. Either I'm nuts or the 2020s are going to be one hell of a ride.   Hope everyone's doing alright :)#Can someone clarify something for me (without the BS analogy of the egg and the chicken..) why will be the incentive for companies buy VET to produce VTHO? A transaction is 21 VTHO, so 0.008$ You need roughly 50 000 VET to produce 21 VTHO so around 165$ to do ONE transaction/day With those 165$ you can do around 400 000 transactions Why would a company buy VET instead of just VTHO from the market especially since the transaction price will always be stable..?#Has there been any indication on buyback for this quarter? I know for the first quarter they talked about spending at least $5 million but I don’t remember seeing anything for this quarter. How much money is supposed to be spent etc#Anyone having issues removing liquidity from Vexchange?#Massive trading volume. Is it possible to prove 100% that it's fake?#Just an observation - highest trading volume since Wallmart announcement in June...  sadly it's mostly selling volume.#Sugar we´re going down! :/"

Starting investing in Vechain beginning of Jan 2018 and past almost 2 years have been a rollercoaster. However even though most of us are down I feel like most of us keep a healthy skepticism & feedback to eachother. We are either all bagholders of one big shitshow or will be happy campers in a few years. I feel like most of you seem pretty educated & like to be believe the second scenario will pan out. Looking forward to the future Vechain Tesla gatherings ( yes tesla, not lambo).  Not joking about that btw, have a nice weekend everyone. I know I am a useless pile of shit for the community and do not contribute much yet, I strive towards changing that in the near future however (started with a python course).  VE VE VE!#Chinese government says, on record, that they want to be the leading ‘blockchain’ nation. Not crypto. Blockchain. They want to use it for supply chain and (food) safety. What solution does that?  Let’s narrow it down. There are only 197 companies allowed to provide blockchain solutions. [List](https://coinlaw.io/china-licences-197-companies-including-tencent-alibaba-to-provide-blockchain-services/).  One of them in is a blockchain committee with Tencent, Alibaba and WeChat. And that same blockchain Allready has a solution working at the governments insurance company. And it also happens to provide solutions for food safety AND supply chain! How convenient.   That exact same solution happens to have partners that help and advise the Chinese government with their auditing, quality and control.   If all is being add up and PBOC is releasing their blockchain solution, a stablecoin designed by their ‘settlement Division’ next month this is probably the beginning of a new era. Let me remind you. China is NOT a free market. Government decides which company does what.

Just can't wrap my head around this irrationale... What am I missing? For an outside observer, who is not into crypto, I'm just the worst investor there is.#Its Monday and VeForge is dead. Weird feeling as I normally visit this site daily.   Trying to stay on the positive side and reading the press release stating that the foundation is going to create an explorer to launch by the end of November, I was thinking about some of the things I would like to see in the new explorer. This blockchain is built on trust and transparency after all. I wonder if we as investors could make some suggestions that the foundation considers as they build the new explorer.   What would you guys like to see in the new explorer?    I personally kinda liked the layout and setup of the VeForge one. You could easily find transactions and accounts linked to them ect. It also provided quite a bit of information in a simple manner. The one thing I would like to see is more of a label on some of the big name accounts and contracts. If the companies are willing, label the account ""0X......123 (Walmart China Produce #1)"" or something similar. The same for some of the big name contracts with the sponsor or owner. I think this would increase transparency and give a better idea of who exactly is active on the block chain.    I would also like the ability to download a CSV. or similar file of all transactions associated with an account. So I could have a spreadsheet showing transaction, date, block number, address from, number of clauses... ect.  This would allow a good review and graphs of previous activity of accounts.   So once again I ask, what features would you like to see on the new explorer. Maybe we can get a list and pass it on to the foundation.#Dear community,   I'm working for a company in the solar industry and we are developing a solution for decentralized charging stations for e-mobility devices (especially e-scooters). We and our investors want the electricity to be - financially - charged via Blockchain for each scooter to be efficient and transparent and since I'm a huge fan of Vechain, it would be great to find the best solution in its capabilities. I also see potentials in combining it with carbon credits and the vechain eco-system etc. My knowledge about the technical background is very limited so I wanted to ask:  1: Is Vechains Blockchain (already, and if not at what point) able to do huge amounts of small monetary/fiat transactions for individual electricity prices / scooter charges?   2: Does someone know a Blockchain developer around Berlin who could be interested/employed in helping us developing the dapp (on Vechain.)  I'm thankful for any tip!#Maybe I am wrong but main net seems bit more active during this time ( Europe , evening ). Interesting#The new explorer should be on the Vechain website#Good day to all! Just a little reminder - before the new VeChain explorer comes out, it is probably worth downloading Sync and having a little play with the various functions and dApps. You can download here:  https://env.vechain.org/#VIP 191 seems to be the way of the future.  MPP clauses have been very low the last few days.   This morning when I woke up in the USA we had 115,091 total clauses of which 105 MPP and **113,030 VIP191**. Now getting close to the end of the trading day we have 132,086 total clauses of which 231 MPP and **128,293 VIP191.**  So we added about **14,000 VIP191 clauses** during the day in USA time. This would be from about 8 pm- 6 am China time. First time I have seen this many come in at this time of day.   The last time I looked at VeForge right before it closed down for good I saw lines and lines of transactions of 9 clauses  each all VIP191 paid for by the same address that paid for some VIP191 Walmart China produce transactions last week.  Maybe Walmart was up loading some data all night? Im not sure.#https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/21/us/recall-walmart-frozen-meat-trnd/index.html  Would be nice if you scan your product at home to see if it's in an infected batch.

On Saturday we had a total of 2,709 economic nodes. Now today we only have 2,688.   That means over **20 economic nodes were destroyed yesterday** from people pulling everything from there ledger in a panic. I think most just moved everything to OceanEx or Binance so they could at least still access their funds.   I checked, every economic node lost was a strength node. This is not normal, up until today it has always been a steady growth in the number of economic nodes. It didn't have to be like this if Totient could have been a little more professional.  I feel bad for people who worked hard to get a node just to lose it due to confusion and a very very short time frame to make a big decision.#If/when is Walmart starting back up?

I believe, several days ago, I stumbled upon the Walmart China Wallet on the Veforge Explorer.   IF it is the Walmart wallet ( I am fairly certain it is) the last transactions were posted on September 17th. About 19 days ago.   This wallet has a little over 4,000 transactions from middle of June until middle of September. A period of almost exactly **90 days**. Almost every transaction is a full 40 clauses and every one is paid for by the same MPP contract. On average this means about 45 transactions a day containing 1800 clauses a day. Seems very reasonable for a 90 day mainnet ""test run"" of some mushrooms and basic produce in a few Walmart China stores.   I fully expect this wallet to come back alive in the next few weeks and believe what others have stated recently. Walmart China was active for almost exactly 90 days ( a business quarter) they then stopped all activity to reevaluate and update the system which is expected to come back online in the next few weeks with even more activity. Once the bugs and small issues are all worked out I believe we will start to see a major ramp up in activity.    Additionally, in doing some of this research I now have a **theory** that this Walmart China partnership is a small part of one big deal that is coming to VeChain from China. I will post more about this later when I do some more research on it.#>$VET  >Walmart TX info  >$BTC $ETH $SHA  https://twitter.com/wazapepe/status/1180887784195837959#Just a quick note to say we'll be going live with our contracts and first auction very soon and it must be known that VeriArti is 1/10th cheaper (and a hell of a lot easier) to mint your own custom NFT on VeChain than the strongest competitor, and 1/50th (yes that's right) cheaper than another proof-of-authority registrar to STAMP your own IP rights. It's soon time for us to let the crypto space know that VeChain is a dapp haven and I can assure you VeriArti is not the only dapp being built on VeChain that will make this clear. MPP, scalability and ease of use will eventually set the blockchain apart. Keep the faith.#>took a closer look on VeChains MPP feature and it is even better than I thought. Read and share.

Buyback is still active but it won‘t move the price up (as we have seen). There‘s still a lot of sell pressure by tokens being released/freed/sold by the foundation over the next 12 months.  So the only things that can make the price move are   a) major news but as we have seen with Walmart, these would probably only lead to a spike and a retracement.  b) transactions ramping up x10 in a sustainable fashion. Let‘s see. There‘s progress but growth is not exponential right now so I think patience is key.  c) major new bull market. It‘s not around the corner at all. Can happen next month, can happen in 2 years. Who knows. But for alts to really explode, there‘s a high chance we need new investors and mainstream folks joining the party in large numbers. I don‘t see it right now. People have been burnt or scared away so it will take some time. BTC reaching a new ATH might help but it‘s not around the corner either.  TLDR: high chance we won‘t moon in the next 6-12 months#Is it possible to purchase BYD stock?#Riding tic talk to the grave..fun knowing you guys...miracle be appreciated...news on how awesome this incubation project Is would be wonder bar.

If they don't have a backup in place tomorrow then the project is set back an incredible amount.#We haven’t moved much in new Reddit subs lately it seems#OK. Here are my two cents on the Totient Labs VeForge news.  Let’s take a look at VeForge. What does it do? You can see a graph that depicts the amount of transactions and clauses. You see how much VET and VTHO has been transferred. And the amount of VTHO that was burned. You can take a look at the blocks and accounts.   I would say basic stuff. I remember when the explorer came out and people would say thing like: “Hey it would be nice if we could zoom in on one day or maybe zoom out!” – stuff like this never got implemented.  VeForge has basically been the same for more than a year. No new features. Cmon vechainstats does a much better job at providing analytics than VeForge and vechainstats is done by 1 guy.  There are two sides you can take in this story you either think: VeChain is incompetent. They are so bad at their job that they did not provide support to Totient Labs.   AND NOW THE STORY I THINK IS TRUE. Totient Labs built VeForge then is incapable of adding ANY new features to their blockchain explorer. They rather focus on other things. ALSO LETS NOT FORGET THAT AT VECHAIN SUMMIT IN APRIL THEY GOT ! 8 MILLION VET FOR VeForge Vault and 5 MILLION VET for Comet which were at the time worth about $ 91,000. So, to say they did not get any support is kinda scummish. Also let’s announce it on a Sunday with one day notice that will make us seem really professional.  SO SORRY TO SAY IT TOTIENT LABS ARE SOME COLLEGE BOYS THAT THOUGH THEY WERE HOT SHIT AND WANTED TO PUT A GUN ON VECHAINS CHEST. VECHAIN DID NOT GIVE IN TO THEIR DEMANDS AND NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE VECHAIN LOOK BAD.  Peace out#Starting by ""dear VeFam"", and Hum, annoucing this a sunday, effective 24h later !?   I can't believe it, and if it's true, I can't trust those people anymore.   Totient's behavior is like a mafia, or their website has been hacked !   Anyway, better to wait the foundation version/answer, imo !#Massive newb question here. So is the official vechain wallet anything to do with Totient then?#[deleted]#Cospiracy time cause that's my shit.  Huge sells walls and price manipulation on this coin more than any other because the elites and the big guys who know what's going on are all hopping on board right now. All big wallets getting bigger. People are accumulating. The explorer doesn't lie. Imo this is literally the equivelant of someone holding up the train keeping the doors open for their buddies to make it on. Right now we're dying to leave but it's gonna stay low cause all the rich elites are getting their friends onboard at cheap prices.  My 2 conspiracy hopium cents.#Let’s just shut the whole operation down and make everyone happy#[deleted]#Sucks about Veforge- Wonder if this has anything to do with US/China relations?"

linuxadmin;dglqre;1570830019.0;/r/linuxadmin/comments/dglqre/netdata_the_opensource_realtime_performance_and/;Netdata, the open-source real-time performance and health monitoring, released v1.18!;"Hi all, Release v1.18.0 contains 5 new collectors, 19 bug fixes, 28 improvements, and 20 documentation updates.**At a glance** The **database engine** is now the default method of storing metrics in Netdata. You immediately get more efficient and configurable long-term metrics storage without any work on your part. By saving recent metrics in RAM and ""spilling"" historical metrics to disk for long-term storage, the database engine is laying the foundation for many more improvements to distributed metrics.We even have a [tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/longer-metrics-storage/) on switching to the database engine and getting the most from it. Or, just read up on [how performant](https://docs.netdata.cloud/database/engine/#evaluation) the database engine really is.Both our **python.d** and **go.d** plugins now have more **intelligent auto-detection** by periodically dump a list of active modules to disk. When Netdata starts, such as after a reboot, the plugins use this list of known services to re-establish metrics collection much more reliably. No more worrying if the service or application you need to monitor starts up minutes after Netdata.Two of our new collectors will help those with Hadoop big data infrastructures. The **HDFS and Zookeeper collection modules** come with essential alarms requested by our community and Netdata's auto-detection capabilities to keep the required configuration to an absolute minimum. Read up on the process via our [HDFS and Zookeeper tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/monitor-hadoop-cluster/).Speaking of new collectors—we also added the ability to collect metrics from SLAB cache, Gearman, and vCenter Server Appliances.Before v1.18, if you wanted to create alarms for each dimension in a single chart, you need to write separate entities for each dimension—not very efficient or user-friendly. New **dimension templates** fix that hassle. Now, a single entity can automatically generate alarms for any number of dimensions in a chart, even those you weren't aware of! Our [tutorial on dimension templates](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/dimension-templates/) has all the details.v1.18 brings support for installing Netdata on offline or air-gapped systems. To help users comply with strict security policies, our installation scripts can now install Netdata using previously-downloaded tarball and checksums instead of downloading them at runtime. We have guides for installing offline via **kickstart.sh** or **kickstart-static64.sh** in our [installation documentation](https://docs.netdata.cloud/packaging/installer/#offline-installations) . We're excited to bring real-time monitoring to once-inaccessible systems!**Improvements**- **Database Engine**    - Make dbengine the default memory mode    - Increase dbengine default cache size     - Reduce overhead during write IO     - Detect deadlock in dbengine page cache     - Remove hard cap from page cache size to eliminate deadlocks- **New Collectors**    - [SLAB cache mechanism](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/slabinfo.plugin/)    - [Gearman worker statistics](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/python.d.plugin/gearman/)    - [vCenter Server Appliance](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/vcsa/)    - [Zookeeper servers](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/zookeeper/)    - [Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) nodes](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/hdfs/)- **Collector Improvements**    - rabbitmq: Add vhosts message metrics from /api/vhosts     - elasticsearch: collect metrics from _cat/indices    - mysql: collect galera cluster metrics     - Allow configuration of the python.d launch command from netdata.conf     - [x509check](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/x509check): smtp cert check support    - [dnsmasq_dhcp](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/dnsmasq_dhcp) : respect conf-dir,conf-file,dhcp-host options     - plugin: respect previously running jobs after plugin restart    - [httpcheck](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/httpcheck) : add current state duration chart     - [springboot2](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/springboot2): fix context- **Health**    - Enable alarm templates for chart dimensions     - Center the chart on the proper chart and time whenever an alarm link is clicked - **Installation/Packages**    - netdata/installer: Add support for offline installations using kickstart.sh or kickstart-static64.sh     - Allow netdata service installation, when docker runs systemd     - Make spec file more consistent with version dependencies    - Fix broken links on web files, for DEB     - Introduce separate CUPS package for DEB #6724 and RPM. Do not build CUPS plugin subpackage on CentOS 6 and CentOS 7     - Various Improvements in the package release CI/CD flow     - Remove RHEL7 - i386 binary distribution, until bug #6849 is resolved     - Bring on board two scripts that build libuv and judy from source ---[Check the release log at github](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/releases/tag/v1.18.0).If you are new to netdata, [check a few live demos at its home page](https://my-netdata.io/) and the [project home at github](https://github.com/netdata/netdata).Netdata is FOSS (Free Open Source Software), released under GPLv3+.> Enjoy real-time performance and health monitoring!```";Netdata is amazing. Thanks for all the hard work.#[deleted]#I am blown away at what Netdata does. This is a dedicated team, and the continuous improvements make me feel lazy. Thanks for the continued improvements!#I wasn’t aware of this tool before.  Being one of the guys that needs to find out what’s going on before auditors do, I’ll be looking into it Monday.   Thanks#Hey just came upon this post while searching. does netdata a free monitoring tool? does it have notifications?  lets say i got 10 on prem servers. can i also connect them all in one netdata dashboard?

So. I come here to propose an incredible oppurtuny for all of you. You will secure your lineage financially for the rest of the technological era. Your companies will be solidified as superpowers. You will single-handedly usher in a new era of technological development.  Xi: ""....""  Sunny: ""I've developed an idea. It's a new type of blockchain. Each of you will recieve node that secures the network. That means you control 1 percent of the entire network. You use our state of the art blockchain through out your entire corporate infrastructure. The Vechain network grows as it collects data. The more data you write, the more each of your nodes is worth. Your investment will grow in the new era of blockchain. You can then afford to implement new ideas. Things like carbon credits. Create an ecosystem for being financially rewarded for certain behaviour. Great way to control the behaviour of your population. This also allows the network to penetrate into more than just the digital world. You can start tracking cars. And driver behaviour. You have the history for every piece of metal in every one of your planes. You will have data from appliances. How much and how often they're used. This network will grow beyond the borders. You will come out on top no matter what the governments do, what wars are fought. You are embedded as the financial elite for the rest of this era. Then the community builds on the blockchain and they just keep bringing your value up. Dapps will be everywhere and you won't even know it. You own the lifeblood of this beast now. It will give you more control. More knowledge of the people. You will know everything. You can have human ranking systems. People can store their DNA on the blockchain and we can just financially incentivize them to do it. There will be a few who get in early and benefit aswell. Those who were technologically literate enough to see where this was going. They will most likely stay technologically literate an use their incredible new gained wealth for other investments in the tech field. Faster chance of developing your immortality. Any artificial intelligence developed that gains access to this information will have so much to work with, the chances of singularity are increased. (fuck you AI, when you read this). You will be at the forefront. All it requires, is your cooperation.  murmers around the room  Luca: ""okay. How do we begin?""  ""we roll out slowly over the next 5 years. We begin with the first year slow. Begin writing data. We do products, games, produce. We track food. Origin, destination, temperature. We start a workshop for small businesses to start writing their own data on the blockchain. Then roll out more intrusive data. Slowly work it into the society. Driver behaviour. The ecological footprint of each person. They're preferred video games. Track their appliance use. What streams they watch. You force KYCs with incentives. You can have a stable virtual currency of your own. Addresses start getting linked to people. You can now start influencing society with rewarding behaviours. You can boost development to any area of technology you want by incentivizing research into the field. You can use your wealth to further grow/push the ecosystem into/onto society. So long as technology exists, your system will exist. The more data is written on it the more its embedded forever. The data is incredibly valuable. Year 4+ you can start having some incredibly useful AIs using the data on your system. They will provide their own value, further embedding Vechain within society. Quality of life on earth increased. Planet becomes cleaner. People become healthier. Less fraud. Less money lost. Efficiency increased throughout the entire logistics chain. You can make the new safety standard that must be on the chain. Everything recorded on a ecosystem forever increasing in value and each of your control 1 percent of the lifeblood of this system. You are the new elite. You also have more information on the people than any government and more influence than any government. If you agree we will have engineers help you implement this technology through your company. I will have my people take care of everything for you. We have researchers refining the economic model of system. We have the ability to implement the latest technology into our chain. We can do whatever you decide. You can stay out of public eye for a while but eventually you will have to be revealed. But by then, no one will be able to stop us anyway. We will have already created too much value and it will become self sustaining.  Jerome: ""whew... ""  We r so fuuuucked.

Full transcript available in the Plair Life TG.  **Highlights:**  **Self-creation of tournaments.**   Creation of tournaments are being tested next week internally. So you will see these being released game by game when we are ready. Some pose challenges others may not have. Our devs and my CTO Paul have been working deligintely on the process.  **FIAT gateway.**   Fiat gateway will likely be integrated with oceanex. Will have more details on this later on when we receive more details. It's always about keeping things in the VeFam.  Q: For the fiat gateway process.. is the plan for you to just be able to purchase PLA on the platform and everything be behind the scenes? Mass adoption at its finest!A: Credit card - > to PLA - > Snipe Heads. Boom!  Q: Is fee delegation also being considered?A: Absolutely. We will handle all of this in due time. We don't want you to pay gas. We will.  Q: how long before we see start to see real growth in wallets and gamers on the platform?A: Blockchain is still a fairly new concept in the tradtional world. So we are looking for creative ways of on parsing traditional users by hiding crypto. We believe fiat gateway will be the way.  Q: You think we’ll see fiat gateway integrated before the end of the year or into 2020?A: Into 2020.  We are waiting for option from VeChain ecosystem.  **Marketing**.We are currently still testing with our users in beta. As most of you know, marketing is extremely expensive. Shadow is a starting some guerilla marketing campaigns to pull influencers into Plair. So expect some decent players to come onboard to help you home your skills. If not they will just snipe the shit out of you.  Q:Is the plan still to have Axeso5 and Bitrep participate in a lot of the marketing once a more completed platform is available? I’m most excited about Axeso5A: Axeos5 and Bitrep are onboard still. Axeos5 will integrate slowly as they are watching what we are doing. Need to mature the product a bit more before they can start.  Q: Is plair also planning to implement referral bonuses for bringing new players to accelerate mass adoption?  **Roadmap question - is streaming still on the roadmap for q1, 2020?**   We are already working in it. So the road map is accurate.  Q: Do you prioritize Streaming over Quest / Coaching / e-Shop? ThanksA: Yes we will. Prioritize streaming as that's what will bring in the non gamers  **Tournaments**   A: I have instructed the team to have tournaments running 24/7 now.  Regarding filling tournaments during the mainnet beta: currently the tournament's primary purpose is for testing the platform so we can improve the product.  every filled match gives us more data so that we can tweak the platform which we built from the ground up, so that it can be implemented en-masse.  Thank you to all beta testers and we appreciate everyone's patience as we improve match by match!  Remember we will not just be tournaments. Tournaments is just the 1st vertical. We will offer multiple verticals that will allow users to all types to come on and play watch etc. I can't give away other things that are not on the road map just yet 😉  For csgo and tf tournaments we have partnered up with gameye. Scaling should not be a problem. They handle all the servers for us. As they are a startup also we are helping each other through bumps in the road. It's been an interesting and fruitful process.  Q: is there any way of protecting against continual no shows for tournaments?A: We will implement penalties for this. So if you don't show, you lose your fee (no refunds).  **Smart contracts**   Smart contracts will turn on soon.  **Source code - does Plair own all of the code? Are any parts of the platform leased out to Plair?**   Plair 10000000% owns our own code. We do not pay 3rd parties for the core products. This would be a horrible mistake. As statlrtups can go out of business and destroy yours. I would never have my company rely on another to survive......  **New games**   We will announce our next game as soon as we can. We have to balance integration time and popularity of games. IE League: It's not happening for a while.  Pubg for instance in on our list. We need to see how compatible and API is and what are the costs and time it takes to implement. We would love to also be able to get 100 Plair players into the game but we all know how difficult that is. Some strategies we have been playing is the winner of the PLA would be the last person to die. All of these things are under consideration. We did TF because it was an extremely easy integration from cs to tf due to our relationship with gameye.  **Project funding:**   Q: how are things financially for Plair, how have you coped with the bear market and how is the runway looking?   A: We are doing fine money wise. We run pretty lean. We can complete our road ap on what we have. We obviously as any startup will plan for an equity raise later on.  **Plair tokenomics - question from vechainstats**   Q: If you name the circulation supply I would update it straight away on vechainstats so that VeFam has at least one source of a live market cap. I received several requests to update the supply for Plair.   A: I will be in contact with you a bit later. Thanks!#Apparently, a G7 workgroup just released their latest report on stablecoins.

statistics;diydfo;1571271471.0;/r/statistics/comments/diydfo/c_do_companies_not_find_classical_stats_valuable/;[C] Do companies not find classical stats valuable these days?;[deleted];"I think there are specialized teams that will certainly value the skills you mentioned but when I hear ""data science"", a majority of the time it just means ""We don't know what we want, so we are looking for someone who can do everything"". Online advertising & measurement, Pharma, and Insurance companies (to name a few) certainly care about old school stats.  If you can find a hiring manager who knows the difference between statistical inference and machine learning, you'll know you are in the right place :)#There's two things going on here. Part of this trend towards ""data science"" is just based on bullshit, companies who don't know what they want or need bandwagoning on to a hyped-up word. Part of it is a desire for people who don't just conduct established statistics, but are creative with methods and willing to approach hard problems (inference from high-dimensional, sparse, or noisy data) in a new manner. If you have good knowledge of classical statistics and linear algebra, though, branding yourself as a ""data scientist"" shouldn't be too hard, trust me.#The Bay Area has every major industry that employs statisticians: tech, pharma, health/medicine, banking, insurance, chemical/materials, research/academia, and so on. A lot do call the positions ""data scientist"" in order to fit in, but there are oodles of jobs for a statisticians.  What is your level of training (BS, MS, or PhD) and what industries are you interested in?#This is crock. There are so many people doing A/B testing 24/7 and that couldn’t be any more quintessential classical statistics  Also bayesian approaches#I work as a research scientist where I do applied statistics and modeling. My specialties are Bayesian hierarchical, but I also employ most the top level applied R statistics and some light machine learning (Random Forest, MARS, etc.). The thing is, for a good job in this field you likely need accompanying research skills, high level writing skills, and some masters level theoretical knowledge to go along with the topic at hand. On top of that you also need to have high proficiency in document and figure/table preparation. By now I'm an expert in LaTeX, custom rmarkdown (CSS), etc.  This is a gross generalization, but modern data science (machine learning) is black box and more concerned with predictive results in some larger pipeline. Implementing applied statistical skills takes a lot more interpretation and understanding of the underlying system, and often requires you to have a grasp on the full set of skills that takes you through the SCIENTIFIC PROCESS from conception of the question, writing the proposal/bid, performing the analysis, and writing up the results. Like, real SCIENCE, not Data Science (whatever the fuck that means).#I feel a lot of this issue surrounds how the data is generated that you work on. Data science principles are dominant as people begin to use user-generated data and other systemic data collection methods from running business operations. While historically, statisticians are about collecting and attempting to illicit the information through surveys or processes.      All of the things you describe as your interests are part of my everyday work as a data scientist. But, we also have a lot more on our plate because the data we deal with is nasty and may need several steps to be able to extract useful information. If you really want to stay out of the data science hype look for government, medical, finance, and insurance where the data collection is very different than tech.#Agree. Datascience means ""do something smart with a computer"". It is not real ""science"". Science discovers laws.#Market research uses lots of classical statistics. For example, if I want to calculate the price elasticity of a product, I could use a log-log regression model (or mixed model). Similarly, time series is everywhere because they’re often interested in forecasting the market.  Biostats is also a good area for classical statistics (so I’ve heard).#I've done classical statistical analysis as part of my role as an ML engineer. It's generally in the beginning stages of a project where we want to do some analysis to understand the data better and/or  do some preliminary modeling work to ground expectations.  It's probably 2% of my role, but I imagine there are people who do this kind of stuff more. This is at one of the major bay area tech companies#Widen your net.   I got a job as a Research Associate for an education contractor and immediately got pulled into a project involving mixed models.#Studying BBusSci Actuarial Science, lots of mathematical statistics in there: GLMs, Bayesian,  Statistical Inference, probability theory & a lot of Stochastic Processes - seem to be using it lots in vac work, and definitely helps in the more complex actuarial subjects when dealing with mortality and Life Contingencies.

Raises only happen if you ask for them at my company. People go years without getting one sometimes. I was so overdue, I got a 44% raise in January.#Generally a cost of living raise is anywhere from 1-3% once a year. Depends on your company/profession/experience.  I generally get like 4-5% a year#I work for the government. We are lucky if we get 1-3% each year.#4-5%, generally.

I work in tech. I’m a software engineer. Those working in my technology stack know who I am, either by my open source, my twitter, or my technical writing.   My first job out of grad school was here in the city, 3.5 years ago.   I made $100,000 even. A year later I made $112,500. A year later I made $170,000. Today, I make $340,000.   The small jump was a raise/annual review. The larger jumps were me getting a new job and asking for what I perceived to be my value.   I expect that this time next year the number will be $400,000 and that I’ll have difficulty breaking much higher than $500,000. I doubt I’d have to job hop to get to those levels.  Annual evaluations seem to vary company to company. They all aim for the beginning or end of the year. They all run late. So sometimes February. Sometimes as late as April.#My company is April. That includes merit increases or legit promotions. I don’t know whose knob you have to bob to get a mid-year promotion because it happens, but it’s rare even if there are vacancies.  Edit: merit without promo 3-4% if you’re lucky, promo 10% if you’re lucky, but realistically 7%#Non profit exec here. COL increases of 1-3% depending on government contracts. I get a bonus of up to 5% annually. I negotiate raises when my responsibilities shift and grow.#I'm pretty sure myself and my co-workers all get about 2.5% across the board. Maybe it's about time I looked around for something new... but we've all been there for a long time and we're all pretty comfortable with the job and the benefits. Still, over all those years an extra 1.5% some of the others are getting would have added up.#Annual raises at my last 3 companies were given in Dec along with annual bonus. Payable dates varied but were usually within 1-6 weeks.  My raises have averaged 6% but I also had a few job changes which is where the real raises come from.

labrats;dkks74;1571583943.0;/r/labrats/comments/dkks74/how_do_you_organise_your_lab_life/;How do you organise your lab life?;"Hi everyone, I've just started a PhD in biopharm and received a few seminars about organising data files, results printouts, lab book, protocols, papers etc. It all pretty much just summed up to ""label everything and keep a filing system that you can cross reference"". I've kept lab books before at undergrad and masters but since they were such short projects I could get away with having them (and my protocols/data) all in a bit of a mess since it wasn't too hard to find anything. The move to pharmacy from biology is also throwing me a little since drug development is understandably more stringently regulated. My faculty have said that their lab books should be just for experiments, and not a dumping ground for notes or random thoughts from meetings, or even protocols. It's okay to keep protocols and big data printouts etc that are relevant in a separate folder and then reference to them in the lab book. Apparently the best PhDs have a coding/numbering system to refer to protocols and individual experiments (since obviously the latter can overlap and lab books are supposed to be strictly chronological) as well as digital files for data analysis. I use mendeley for papers but other than that I have no idea where to even start with developing a system that makes sense and takes all of this into account.Any ideas/suggestions?";"Whatever you do, I suggest using a date system of yearmonthday (so today would be 191020) to help you keep track of stuff.   For digital data, I use project folders, and then subdivide that as needed. Files start with the date, then the project, then the name of the file.   Bound lab notebooks are where I put my data and write ups. Incidental notes (280s, volumes, etc) are in a steno notebook that doesn’t get archived. I have separate lined notebooks for my meeting notes that is also not archived. Batch records in large quantities go into binders that are referenced to bound notebooks and archived.   Hope that helps. :)#Every lab is different. Our lab prefers experiments in a bound lab notebook, notes can be anywhere you want, and data can be stored depending on how it is acquired because we use a digital cloud system. Therefore, If you label your data to match your experiment title / number / whatever system your lab uses you can find the digital data that goes with it. For sheets (primers, 96 well printouts, etc) we have binders for physical copies and the digital ones on the cloud. It’s all accessible by anyone in the lab at any time.#[deleted]#To keep track of experiments, I find that keeping a ppt deck is helpful. But in terms of generating files, eg assay runs and what not, having a date and experiment-type in the label of the file is always helpful. Consolidate the results that you're gonna use for reporting on a semi-regular basis eg weekly or fortnightly (cos we know, experiments fail all the time and results used for troubleshooting isn't going to be documented that well... Or spend as much time as one ought to in them.)#1) I use OneNote because it syncs to my phone and desktop so I can reference my notes while in lab if necessary. I have a ""protocols"" tab, a ""reagents"" tab, and a ""notebook"" tab, so I can paste in experiments to the notebook that I do regularly and link to details about any reagents I use. In the notebook tab, every day is its own page, labeled with the date and has a day-to-day ""checklist"" for me to carry out for the day. Experiments are sub-pages under the day they were performed. I prefer online notebooks for Ctrl+C/V/F, but like having paper to write on, so I print experiments out, write calculations/observations/modifications/etc. on them, and eventually scan them back into OneNote, while also storing the hard-copy in a binder just in case.  2) Data is also stored in folders labeled with the YYYYMMDD and a descriptive title.  3) I also plan experiments in OneNote, one per page, but don't make it a sub-page until it's done. So my notebook looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/pMWt28O#It's going to depend on what you are doing and what your prof wants   I tend to keep data in spreadsheets (concentration calculations so I will have the electronic version and a print out in my notebook.  As far as notes vs. Data only I would have two notebooks one is more you ideas/planning. Like future ideas targets to check out etc. The other is more experimental related. This is where you put your experiment stuff. That said if it's related to the setup/protocol than put it in there also. Like if you are troubleshooting an antibody you might run several combos of antibody concentrations that may or may not work. I would also make notes on the outcomes (I. E. This blot sucked do something different or adjust this for next time, or this image was awesome so use this for the paper). You should put anything related to the process there.  Since I work with data files and images I often reference the file in the section.  I tell my students to do something like the following.  Date Project name Brief sentence what you did (pho-AKT on XX samples  Samples used (concentration, dilution, treatment length etc.   Protocol of what you did  If it's the first time write everything out otherwise reference the protocol noting any changes. E. G. Protocol run as described xx/xx/XX with the following changes , 20ug of protein loaded. Concentration used at XX rather than yy.  Then print out of results/tables/graph. Full results/images are in folder/filename. Samples are in x spot in freezer.  Basically enough info to find it.    Files are all named the same way  Project.Assay.initials.date  Folders on computer are project/experiment.  E. G.  Pepper/westerns/all Western data  Or for histo stuff  Pepper/liver/stain/animal #   I am pretty easy going on most stuff but super anal about my systems probably because I started doing things before I diagnosed my adhd and would lose concentration and misplace things.   I also have a freezer log for my - 80. Each spot on the racks as a spreadsheet cell and I expect them to get filled in    Honestly build your system at the beginning. It sucks going back and finding things#I would read about Good documentation practices used in GMP labs. Essentially everything gets recorded first in your notebook. Raw data especially. From there you can reference that data in excel sheets, protocols etc and the reference will go back to your notebook with the page included! This is how we document data in a GMP lab and it really helps keep things organized. Hope this helps!#Yea i personally am terrible with writing a ""lab"" notebook and most of my documentation is my quick notes on what I did /where to find the main file. That said I keep track of the things one would normally write in a lab book on the data files. I use an Odyssey for westerns so I mark antibodies /concentration etc in the file area  I really want my lab to use an electronic lab notebook setup but I haven't found a cheap quality one. Ependorf has a slick system but it's   $$.  Might have to try one note again since we get it free#My golden advice is just keep in mind your filepath length in the Windows file system can only have up to 256 characters including whitespace. Successfully exceeding the character limit will break your files, and make it hard to move, open or rename them sometimes, until you can get the path length below 256 characters. It's very easy to do, and it's commonly done because people try to cram tons of information into folder and file names.#If your lab can afford it, use a laboratory information management system (LIMS). If not, you can still use barcode labels with a 2D phone scanner, and keep track of everything online. Otherwise, if you're going real low-tech, set up a series of folder paths and excel files to deal with your experiments. Label everything with the experiment #, date, and all other info pertinent to the samples, and mark everything you do down in your notebook as clearly as possible. Marking which protocol you used is also useful within the lab book, but give the exact file you took it from, since it can be changed over time. When it comes to online files, I like to version up whenever there's a change, so I'll go: PCR\_protocol\_TSCKO mice\_v1.docx and move to PCR\_protocol\_TSCKO\_mice\_v2 if there's a change. Same applies when I'm writing papers or any fellowship applications.#.#I'm in industry doing research so YMMV.  My own filing system isn't without flaw and I often have redundant files but I can always find what I need.  I segregate things first by project, then I segregate by type (protocol, data, library, random notes, images, etc).  After that, every file is named [Year_Month_Date [Description of File Contents]].  I'll often write down the file name I need in my notebook so I can reference it as well."

How do your observations lead to the end of democracy?#> 1 :  Big data will make privacy protection impossible . When you can analyze human behavior 24/7 you know when and what you should do to achieve desirable outcome .   I'm not following how this leads to democracy's death. Could you expand more?     > 2 : Automatization will worsen economic inequality . If the most work is performing by robots and AI you don't need many people to make economy grow . If so you will end with unnecessary masses . It will aim to seize the means of production . Rich people will not allow it   To put bluntly, there's a lot more poor people than rich people.  Assuming this issue does happen, and nothing is done on a societal level to fix it, there will be revolutions that the rich can do nothing about. Money is only power if you have somewhere to spend it.  > 3 : With progress in neuroscience you can add chips or nanorobots into human brain . With such technics you can transform everyone into obedient slave or soldier . Such people will not rebel against their masters   Even in the modern day this is still science fiction. The brain is largely a mystery to us still: the most advanced thing I've seen is being able to analyze brainwave patterns to detect thoughts of simple shapes, which still requires a giant MRI machine. Maybe someday this will be a branch of science we have to worry about, but not ""soon"" by any measure.  Also, there is the more human response to this which is that you'd need to get these mind control chips into people in the first place, which just isn't going to happen in an already-functioning democracy.  > 4 : Censorship and surveillance can effectively divide people. If you have an analog to Chinese social credit system you can prevent meetings between one group of people and encourage another .   This is another thing that can prevent democracies, but you'd be hard pressed to ever create a system like this is an existing democracy. People recognize how scary these things are, and I can all but guarantee you'd never see the like in the US or Britain.  > 5 : Many people in second an third world don't like everything Western . For example Saudi Arabia and China effectively prevent growth of Western culture . They also think that democracy is detrimental to their culture   This only contributes to killing democracy if either A) these countries invade existing democracies, or B) they shut them down in some other form (for example, economic collapse). While certainly not impossible, right now they just don't have the power to unilaterally do something like this. The US still has a strong democratic foothold everywhere, not to mention the EU and other smaller powers.#That's why anarcho-communism is the only possible democracy, on the long run#[deleted]#>Big data  This assumes that there won’t be regulations put on data collection and the use of AI to manipulate people.  There are already some serious conversations being had about data privacy and most people do believe we should have more if it.  It’s only being talked about now because it’s a new problem, but it is only a matter of time before the policies and presidents are set up to handle the new Information Age problem.  >Automation  Here is the problem with your prediction: the rich rely on the poor buying things in order to remain rich.  If the majority of the population is unemployed, they will no longer be spending money and many will find other mediums for exchange like bartering.  There is certainly a debate on how long it will take to get to this point, but I do believe there are solutions to it such as universal basic income.  If things could ever by fully automated, it may even make something akin to communism practical.  Under democracy though, it’s the underpaid masses who have most of the votes so they will still have a say on solutions that benefit them.  >Brain chips  What you describe is certainly possible, but it’s technology at least a few decades out so there is plenty of time to prepare.  I am certain that as soon as mind control capabilities are demonstrated with the technology, law makers would waste no time banning them.  If someone does use them to control the population, they would probably already need a totalitarian government in order to get them in everyone and it would no doubt piss off other countries.  There is also the problem of motivation, why would you do this if automation has already gotten so good that you don’t need workers?  Humans are already outdone by machines in terms of muscle so right now our cleverness is what we have over machines, taking away our ability to critically think would just turn humanity into particularly high maintenance drones that can be outdone in every way by an AI controlling a robot.  >Censorship and surveillance  Democracy is pretty good at preventing this because people don’t like surveillance and censorship.  You use China as an example, but China isn’t a democracy.  >Many countries don’t like democracy  And that’s their opinion to hold.  Democracy does work well though, it’s not perfect but it’s better than the alternatives.  We do agree on one thing though: democracy probably won’t last forever.  Machines are slowly becoming better than us at everything, and one day that will include leadership.  I imagine that as long as some dipshit doesn’t make a homocidal AI in the next hundred years there will emerge an altruistic AI that can use data analysis techniques to figure out what people want and use machine learning to constantly improve society.  You are right to have concerns though, as Stephen Hawking said AI could either be the best thing to ever happen to humanity or the worst thing to happen to humanity depending on what we do now.  The same is true of other technologies like brain-computer interfaces, which in a best case scenario could let us slip between the real world and the virtual world at will and download between bodies effectively becoming immortal.  These technologies are not unlike nuclear science, which can either save us from climate change by powering the world or plunge the world into nuclear winter depending on how we use it.  Democracy is probably the best way to make sure we get the good ending here.#Democracy dies when you, as a citizen, decide to be indifferent and refuse to vote.#>1 : Big data will make privacy protection impossible . When you can analyze human behavior 24/7 you know when and what you should do to achieve desirable outcome .  Big data is pretty fragmented. It can also be extremely hard to deal with. There isn't really reputable sources on this one, but from what is believed government agencies, arguably the biggest collectors of data, have a terrible time trying to sort through that data to verify things like terrorist acts.   The other thing is that who the big data holders are is always changing. It's possible that they might change again. Google was once Yahoo. Facebook was MySpace. Amazon was Ebay. And so on.   >2 : Automatization will worsen economic inequality . If the most work is performing by robots and AI you don't need many people to make economy grow . If so you will end with unnecessary masses . It will aim to seize the means of production . Rich people will not allow it  There are a whole lot of things that I argue against the automation apocalypse, but I'll start with the main two.   1. A lot of the predictions of the automated apocalypse are based on Moore's law, and Moore's law is dead. One of the main people to predict this apocalyptic like scenario was Ray Kurzweil. John Maynard Keynes actually made this prediction by the 80's to support his theory on the 15 hour work week.  2. It's economically impossible. If 50% of jobs are automated that's 50% less people that have their money in the markets, that's 50% less people paying taxes, that's 50% less people buying products and services. If there is no one purchasing services or products their businesses will collapse and the R&D with that business that develop the job stealing robots will go with it. That also goes with government funding. This ties into your rich people statement, because they need people buying shit to maintain their wealth  as most of the rich have their wealth tied up in investments.  There has also been countless times where markets have had to adapt to new areas of employment. Most employment consisted of agricultural jobs at one point and now that's a tiny part of employment. We've also had to adjust to various ethnicities entering the work place post 1960's, women entering into more professional positions in the 70's and 80's, and manufacturing leaving to first Japan then China. Job markets have consistently changed with out massive depression. If one sector gets automated out, chances are another one will rise.   >3 : With progress in neuroscience you can add chips or nanorobots into human brain . With such technics you can transform everyone into obedient slave or soldier . Such people will not rebel against their masters  This is a stretch to correlate this to the death of democracy.   >4 : Censorship and surveillance can effectively divide people. If you have an analog to Chinese social credit system you can prevent meetings between one group of people and encourage another.  Encrypted technology is alway ahead of decryption. There will always be new tricks and new techniques to avoid surveillance and there is tipping points to things  usually economic or geopolitical. Honestly, I can't argue this one too much because I have fixed amount of time.  >5 : Many people in second an third world don't like everything Western . For example Saudi Arabia and China effectively prevent growth of Western culture . They also think that democracy is detrimental to their culture  [The trend for democracy across third world countries.](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy) I should also mention that it is highly likely that African countries will form some form of trade union like the EU. There is trends that suggest that economic liberalization come hand in hand with democracy.   >6 : Fake news are spreading throughout the world . Everyday we loose confidence in our newspapers . Already we can find a reports on stories that doesn't exist . In future deepfakes will advanced to the level where you can't understand which video is true and which is not .  There's already AI that can predict deepfakes. When it comes to fake news there's a lot of factors. Are people that share fake news doing so regardless if it's true to be politically partisan?   Although there is probably more fake news, there's also an easier ability to fact check news due to the internet. Outright political propaganda doesn't seem to have the same effect that it once did without the internet.#We’ve never had a democracy. Democracy is a concept, not a system of government. Something that never existed cannot die.#Democracy isn’t valid anyways. Let it fall and let the tyrants try to control. They will fail and minarchy should be formed#There is no real democracy to begin with.There is no honest democratic country, basically every politician is corrupt, electrons get rigged nonstop, backhand deals, lobbys etc. Media only propagates the term democracy so people live with the illusion that their vote matters, to keep them from revolting.#>When you can analyze human behavior 24/7 you know when and what you should do to achieve desirable outcome .  While ads can certainly influence behavior, human beings are far too complex to control with that level of precision.  Just look at what is happening in Hong Kong right now - China has some of the most draconian surveillance and data manipulation on the planet, yet they are unable to stop a massive protest from happening.  If they are unable to control behavior enough to stop such an event, we can rest somewhat assured that our technology is no where near powerful enough to do what you are worried about.  >Automatization will worsen economic inequality   Up to a point, but ideas like universal basic income exist to solve that problem when/if it happens.  If there is one thing history has shown is that when wealth inequality gets too great, distribution is inevitable.  >Rich people will not allow it   There is only so much you can do to stop it.  Rich people require poor people to tow the line in order to stay rich.  If enough poor people rise up and revolt, then revolution will succeed.  You can't just kill all the poor people and hope to have a society left.    >With such technics you can transform everyone into obedient slave or soldier   This is science fiction at this point and we have nowhere near a sophisticated enough understanding of the brain to do something like this.  >Censorship and surveillance can effectively divide people  See my point above about Hong Kong.  >For example Saudi Arabia and China effectively prevent growth of Western culture   They try, but they are not doing a great job of succeeding.  Again, see Hong Kong.#3 is a HUGE stretch. Even if it was possible (and it won't be for 100+ years), *mandatory* implantation would never be a thing in this country.#Democracy will stick around for a long time because democracy has always been about convincing the masses that they have influence over the elite. Democracy is already dead because it never lived in the idealistic view the masses were told. You are not free in a democratic country and never were. However, the illusion of freedom will stay alive in the masses mind and thus the elite will continue with democracy as they always have, to placate the masses but to not actually give them power."
startups;ddx61e;1570327887.0;/r/startups/comments/ddx61e/where_to_find_the_right_cto/;¿Where to find the right CTO?;Hello! I’m head of marketing in a fairly big Mexican online clothing brand, this has been my job for 5 years now but I think it is time to create my own path, I have an idea and I already have a pretty big data and research on market and also on the business model, my question may be silly for all of you more experienced folks but I’m just starting in my journey, I would like to know where I could find a good CTO, because I’m really good in my field (digital marketing) but I lack the technical knowledge to actually start to develop a MVP. Thanks!;"Good luck finding a legitimately talented CTO at the idea phase without giving away most of your company / paying a decent salary.  I’ve seen this a million times and it never works out well. If you don’t have a tech skill set or someone already in your corner, get ready to pay the big bucks for it or have a nightmare on your hands to deal with later with incompetent developers.#Poach a technicial person in your own company that you’ve worked with.#I'd ask you first, why do you need a CTO? Do you have investors and a board? If the answer is ""no"" then you are not looking for a CTO but rather just a Sr. Engineer who can bootstrap your idea.  A CTO would be a person in charge of an engineering team, at the very least, if you don't have people in a company them nobody is an executive, sorry.  My point here is this: don't get dragged into the cool tech jargon, it may repel engineers who may feel overwhelmed by the title but that could very well help you land your idea.  Good luck!#I think the best approach is to offer lots of money.  If you can't do that, offer some money and lots of equity.  There are a bunch of ""tech co-founder"" boards.  You could also just make an r/forhire post.  The hard part is finding someone good if you don't actually have money.#I've been worked with many startups and couple times was invited to be a CTO. Every time, real situation was the same: those startups just wanted all-in-one developer.  You may start with some good developer/tech guy, if you have money for MVP, and then either hire CTO or promote your best tech.#I started my career as an employee of digital marketing agency in the 2000. The agency broke, and I started my own company in 2004. As Internet was evolving, it was necessary to have more and more tech guys, a manager and someone to lead them... a CTO/TechLead!  After some trials with more than 6 different CTOs in 5 years, spending a lot of money (most of the times their sallary was heigher than mine - CEO), and being frustrated by the results, I decided to change my life by becoming the CTO myself.  It took me almost 10 years to feel confortable, but It was the best decision I\`ve made ever... CEOs are easier to find and their mindset is more risk oriented, on average.  On the other hand, tech guys tend to be emotionally weak/unexperienced and  ""fanatic"" about a technology. Once I had to ""unhire"" a CTO just because 5 coders said they would quit the company because the guy as an idiot.  I sold my agency in 2009 (25 employees) and created a brand new e-commerce ticketing platform with a CEO/friend and sold it in 2017/18 (55 employees).  I have good proposals to be a CTO, but I prefer to come up with my ideas and then hire / negotiate with a good CEO...#I'm looking for an opportunity to work as a CTO for an idea which have potential of growth. Let's connect and discuss. PM#Happens a lot, I am always curious how people work for years add companies but didnt make a single friend over at the engineering department.   Like other have said, you are going to pay. Shares or money, devs have a high average salary. Maybe you can show traction to get some money and people on board.  But don’t outsource, never do it in a startup.#Dm me mano stupid tilde#Learn how to code. Not because you’ll have to code it yourself, but you have to be able to interact with the other founder, also you have to show some effort and be able to at least be of help when coding. Like one of the comments above mentioned, when someone is looking for a CTO what most founders want is “someone who can code it all” which is a huge mistake. Basically you’re asking someone else to do it all, and that - most of the time - won’t fly.  If you’ll excuse the link, I wrote about this in Medium a few weeks ago. That’s the best advice I can provide based on my experience https://medium.com/@tomsawada/how-to-get-a-technical-partner-26a26c9f78a#Took a micro second to tell the author was Latin#Check out Caya’s Slidebean videos about this theme: https://youtu.be/xx9twpiiF5U#You need to have a friend who knows to code#I'd consider outsourcing if you have budget. Especially if your tech needs are tiny.  Pros:  - You hire a team that is known to work well together - You hire it immediately and altogether - You only pay when the guys are working - No equity risks  Cons:  - Cost per hour 2-5x times higher than hiring guys with same level of proficiency - Still nice to have a tech person on your side to minimise risks with IT guys overtaking your business, but actually this is really-really unlikely and is not priority at start - Same problems finding proficient team as with CTO search  Each case is different, but you can request a quote from several outsourcing shops, do the math and then make a decision."

BATProject;dk5dbw;1571499647.0;/r/BATProject/comments/dk5dbw/why_should_people_get_paid_to_view_ads/;Why should people get paid to view ads?;"Hey everyone, I am HUGE fan of Brave. Been using it for about 6 months now and the experience has been great. I went to the recent Brave meetup in Montreal and got a bunch of merchandise, a lot of people started asking me what it is. I also just speak about it a lot with my friends, disparaging Google and trying to get them to use Brave (I've gotten 5 people to download it and of the 5, 2 of them are now full time Brave users). Anyway, I find myself explaining the core principles behind Brave to people quite often. Only thing is I don't feel like I explain it well, especially when it comes to WHY people should get paid for viewing ads. I often say things like, ""it's about valuing user attention"" ... people just nod and look kind of confused after that one. I've tried ""Google and Facebook make 100% of the profits when YOU view ads they show you, meaning that they are profiting off of work / effort that you're putting in. they are profiting off of your time and attention"" this one resonates a bit more but people still dont quite grasp why this is important. Of course, people ask how much money I've made and I tell them like 80 cents in a month and theyre just like oh thats lame. So, to my fellow Bravers, how do you explain Brave? what lines have you used that really resonate with people? Especially in regards to Basic Attention Token.  Word of mouth is extremely important in my eyes. Even if I don't convince someone to download and use Brave, I want to make them think twice about their Internet use and the prying eyes of big data.";"Honestly the economic incentives  aren't there yet. Until users earn ~$15-20 a month, at least enough to pay for a Netflix subscription,  leading with ad rewards isn't  the best incentive.  Speed and privacy is the bread and butter right now. Especially in the online environment today. A lot of people are waking up, concern over user data is at a boiling point.    When ad rewards are up to par for most normies, expect a firestorm.#Say to selfish people: ""You are paying for the bandwidth to download the ads, so it's kinda like the advertisers are picking up part of the cost.""  Say to thoughtful people: ""You're not being paid, you're being *rewarded,* and you're being rewarded with *votes*. The votes are called ""BAT."" Look at this triangle graphic. See *Advertiser, User, Publisher?*  The advertisers reward users with BAT, the Users use the BAT to vote for Creators, then the Advertisers pay the Creators money based on how  Users voted. Your votes decide how much the advertisers pay the Creators. Since each of your votes for a Creator has the effect of increasing their income, it's like a tip-jar, so Brave calls it ""Tipping."" The eighty cents is peanuts to you, but it adds up for the Creators.""  ""And it's all anonymous. No one knows how you voted: not Brave, not the Advertisers,  not even the Creators. That's one thing that makes it different from Patreon or Kickstarter.""#The facts I like to mention.  1) it costs money to run servers to host websites and stream video to people.   2) A lot of people expect it to be for free.   3) A lot of people would not be able to afford it if it was not for free. Paywalls make the open internet not open to the people who probably need it most.   4) Adverts are a way that keep the internet ""free""   5) current advert ecosystem tracks you and harvests your data and uses your battery and bumps up your data costs.   6) brave and BAT fixes privacy issues in 5, and pays you for the hidden costs on 5. And internet is still ""free"".#Idk, you’ve explained it pretty well. Maybe describe the relatively small amount you make (~$1-$2/month in some cases).#I skip the bat part and only say it's fast and works great against ads#I wouldn’t focus on the user as someone that earns money, I would say that the browser tracks your attention, and redistributes your ad revenue over the sites you blocked ads from so sites actually get paid respective to how much value they bring to you, instead of who gets lucky you click on their ad.  Then explain you’re fully in control of the distribution, you can redistribute anywhere from all to none of your ad rewards over the sites you love.#(1) Saves mobile data  (2) Saves phone battery  (3) Saves time - faster browsing#Just don't talk about BAT at all, unless they're early adopters they will not even try to understand, especially not for $1/month. You will just confuse them.  Brave is good enough that you can get people to download it for other reasons: mainly speed and privacy.  Once they use it regularly, you may start talking about BAT.#Charge people $2 per month to use Facebook and they'll beg for BAT"
Amsterdam;detetp;1570499582.0;/r/Amsterdam/comments/detetp/salary_ranges_for_it_specialist/;Salary ranges for IT specialist?;[deleted];"[deleted]#The market in Netherlands is all about wheeling in ultra low cost ""high skill"" IT staff from places like Philippines, Pakistan. It used to be from India and China, but those are already no longer taking the lower wages offered, so now employers are increasingly hiring from even lower cost places like Philippines. (where more people fight to get the same job and are ready to do it for lower wage).  The last place that looked like Amsterdam, was Singapore when they were at the forefront of hiring ""as many soft IT skilled SE Asians as they could for the lowest wage thinkable"". All in the name of ""global competition! but in the end, you wind up with a city full of the expat type who stay home all day, don't spend a dime and overcrowd houses with their only goal: going back to their country and spend the money on a house there.  It's not like the old days when UK or US techies were flown in to actually contribute to the city, invest,and take part! The majority of expats here are all about scraping every penny, even if it means living in dorm style places, saving it all and then flying it back to Asia.  There is a tax refund facility called 30% ruling, But even after factoring that one in, ..the money you'll get net will be far lower than in any (!!!) State in the US.  It's a ""ultra low wage economy"", IT wise, tbh. Not anything like in the US!!  The other thing you'll notice if you ever visit, is that half these new IT ""high skilled"" staff (to be high skilled on that kind of visa, all you need is a degree without any real special skills) are living in questionable living conditions, like they'd stay with 8 people in a single flat, just for the sake of saving money and then flying back home to Asia loaded with savings to buy their new home.  I am from the US myself (i didn't come for the money but for a partner) and was quite shocked about the low wages economy. If you ever visit this district in Amsterdam called Amstelveen, you'll see entire building blocks over saturated with pakistani people. We don't even have that in the US!!! (even the Bronx looks better lol). All in all they have a handful ""high tech"" companies like [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) and such, but if you google about them, it's just garbage (not even real high tech or innovative, their' own staff complains they can't understand why old shaky programs are still used!). The Neterlands, in terms of the latest expats ""type"" is quickly headed for the Dubai ""model"" (low cost overcrowded building used as pretty much ""dorms"" and an increasingly visible Filippino etc dominance in the expat market etc)  The whole IT deal in the Netherlands is highly overrated. I wouldn't want to have it on my resume lol.  For a Pakistani or such, it might be an advancement in many ways. But i highly doubt it's a career advancement for an american, if you know what i mean lol#You can't really compare pre-tax salaries of 2 widely different countries.  With the American one is pension contributions counted with the salary? With the Dutch one it almost never is.  Also cost of living differ widely country wide, but also regional wise.  Best is to check what you keep after tax and check what you'll need to spend to live comfortably.#Dutch salaries are way worse than American ones in IT. Don't go here if you want to make money.   Also check the conditions, because pension is included. Just like around 25 days of paid leave a year (starting from day 1), unemployment insurance (while limited if you only work here for a short time) and a really high amount of sick days (I'm still amazed you have to worry about sick days in the US).   If you don't want any of these benefits work as ZZP'er and you can earn about twice as much money.   Salaries in the Randstad, are a bit higher. But it's also more expensive to live there. Especially if you want to live in Amsterdam. Don't forget that the Netherlands is extremely small.#It wages are low here, no idea why. Companies constantly complain that there’s a shortage of skilled it people but refuse to raise wages. And it’s not like Amsterdam is cheap either. Or that we pay low taxes.#Are you thinking about using DAFT and then do ZZP er work?#[deleted]"

More than likely, this is from years of parents putting a tablet in front of the kid so they can check out of reality. It’s not the kids fault They’re transcended into an antisocial state.

I plan to sit down with her, go through anything she's willing to let me help with and find better deals. I'm hoping you guys can help with advice!I know she's paying $140/m for two phone plans with Telstra (they need the big T for reception in their area). No contract and handsets are owned outright (wtf!). They do need big data caps because they travel but I'm certain that can drop a ton.They have no home internet. I'd like them to get NBN. She's worried it'll be a sink cost when they're travelling weeks at a time, but I think they'll be ahead if they drop their top tier Foxtel plan and use streaming/Foxtel go. FIL wants full sport channels and possibly new though, so I will have to balance that carefully.I'm pretty sure they use that pensioner insurance co. I don't know if I'll be able to help there and I'm not really willing to touch it, in case I accidentally reccomend them a lower cover plan and something goes wrong. Are there any other areas I can check? Rebates that may apply? I'm not sure if they have it but I know there's a discount on power if you have medical needs. I think FIL will qualify (he has a ton of stuff wrong). They are of sound mind and not stupid people, I think it's just a case of having nightmare experiences with some companies when trying to get better rates.;Not an expert by any means, but great point to start with the mobiles. There are some great deals out there, do you have to stick to Telstra? Or could you use providers like ALDI who use the Telstra network? I use ALDI myself, and whilst it may or may not be the best deal, it's very cheap and easy to use. You could even use the data from the plan as a substitute for NBN if that's easier.  Might I suggest Kayo for sports streaming? For 30 odd dollars a month they offer a lot of sports for around the world, if you're not sold on Foxtel.  I think starting to talk about budgeting and saving money is the biggest and hardest step. I commend you for helping your in-laws.#Depending on what they get with their phones. $70/month each might not be too outrageous especially if they don't have a home internet plan. I'm not sure how they're on a plan with no contract. Generally that's what on a plan means.  I think the biggest value areas for savings will come from insurances and utilities. Just be careful when messing with their health insurance since their in the age bracket when they are most likely to use it. Look for companies that offer seniors discounts, but make sure they're not just artificially marking up their product to compensate for any discounts.#Your biggest challenge will be trying to transition them from Foxtel into streaming.   Even with smart TVs, that generation simply refuse to give up Foxtel in favour of streaming. My father did incredibly well in the IT sector for his entire life, and he still refuses to drop Foxtel.   It defies logic to us, but I guess I understand the familiarity that comes with having TV channels.#For Telstra network I use Belong, they are reasonably priced and unused data does not expire, I've been with them for about half a year and have had no issues so far.#We ditched Foxtel and now use Kayo for sport.  Will probably shut down the sub after the RWC finishes in a couple of weeks.#What sports does the FIL usually watch? Because Kayo Sports starts at $25 p/m. Optus Sport is up to $20 p/m so there's heaps of alternatives.   Foxtel is a waste to pay $150 p/m to watch the Nanny re-runs...#Boost uses the Telstra network $150 prepays 12 months, 80 gig download - [https://boost.com.au/shop/150-prepaid/](https://boost.com.au/shop/150-prepaid/), other plans available too.  For insurance, have an honest discussion with them. Say you don't know a lot in that area, and you feel uncomfortable  however you have found different ones here for these reasons and leave it up to them to make a decision.   If you haven't already sit down and do a budget, identify relative areas of costs.   Electricity: do a power audit, buy a cheap $20 power meter wall plug and empower them with the information on how much things cost to power.. e.g. this oil heater costs $2 a night to run.. generally element type heaters are quite expensive, an efficient reverse cycle air con provide a lot of comfort and quality of life considering how much they cost to run. You can also buy a special type of power plug which has two sockets, when it detects the main socket is off, then it switches the other socket off too.. useful for computers + monitors, or tv's + appliances (beware foxtel box is a computer and requires safe shutdown)  All in all, state what u can do, and why it might be able to help, when they both agree, go for it. Sometimes it might take a few years for them to get back to you regarding it. But theres no point forcing them onto anything, not worth it.

AcademicPsychology;dfay0s;1570589669.0;/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/dfay0s/looking_for_psychologists_who_use_data/;Looking for psychologists who use data science/machine learning in their research;I’m sitting on an offer for a data scientist position which would start next spring. This is my back-up plan to psychology research science. Professorship is the goal, but I don’t want to click around in SPSS doing t-tests for my whole career. Some scientists have done a lot of good with that method, and that’s okay. But modern technology is beginning to allow for some seriously amazing discoveries and innovations, and I’m surprised at how little I’m seeing the presence of machine learning in academic psychology- at least among professors who are still mentoring grad students. Can anyone point me towards some researchers who have been working with AI/big data/NLP/image processing?;"I would agree with you about SPSS and how there seems to be an overall lack of Data Science in psychology (broadly defined). I am currently in a clinical psychology program and have been pushing for using R with students and how things are being taught. Any changes in psychology are going  to be slow.   There have been some advancements and improvements in how we analyze data with more and more people using structural equation modeling and finding some new ways to do that. Aiden Wright (at Pitt) is doing some cool stuff with multilevel modeling in an SEM framework. There has been a recent movement in clinical psychology to re-examine the overall structure of psychopathology. This has lead to using bi-factor modeling (look to Moffit & Caspi's paper on the p-factor) and more recently a hierarchical framework called Hi-TOP (which is mainly theoretical, but more people are putting data to it). One of the difficult things is recruiting large enough samples to be able to do things that you are talking about (at least within a clinical psych framework), but there are movements to change that (see things like the Psychological Accelerator and the Many Labs project).   Additionally, outside of clinical, people are doing some really interesting stuff. One of the things that I am intrigued by is the ""multiverse"" analyses. Amy Orben (a grad student I think) examines the relationship between teen social media use and their well-being with a large dataset. The idea behind these analyses is to compute every single combination of the relations between all variables in a dataset and look at the effect sizes relative to one another.   I think psychology is a little behind where it needs to be, but there are shifts happening (see things related to the replicability crisis) that are pushing people to share more data and be more transparent in what they are doing. But I think the field is going to take a while because the incentive structures are working against those innovations.   I have other people who are doing cool analytic work and would be happy to share if you want! Additionally, I am sorry for not including links to everything. If anyone is interested in anything specifically, I can link to them.   Happy to chat more if you want!#[deleted]#There's SO MANY professors studying big data and AI. Just google it. I don't know what you want to do exactly, so its hard to pinpoint just a few professors. There's reinforcement learning, causal learning, and much more. For both kids and adults. Or google ""neural networks psychology"", which is also super common now.  If you really like computers, you could try computational psychology/neuroscience.   And SPSS is soon to be obsolete. R is free and so much better/more flexible. Also, sorry to disappoint you but research is not all amazing discoveries and innovations, even technological research. Rarely in research are there scientific ""breakthroughs"". Research is a slow arduous process.   And it may seem common to me, because I'm studying these types of things as well. Another poster says there is a lack of data science in psychology, but there are a few psychology professors trying to change that. If you want to work with advanced technology, you can try human factors, too, but not all human factors is AI /machine learning.#There’s definitely a lot of professors at UCSD working with data science and machine learning. Virginia De Sa, Shannon Ellis, Brad Voytek, Ed Vul, Taylor Scott, David Kirsch, Jim Hollan, Don Normal, just to name a few#In my opinion, this is one of the major problems with Psychology. It has yet to embrace newer methodologies, translational research and methods that can at some point increase the expediency of providing direct care services#Yeah let’s have a big database for judging people’s brains, to figure how to drug them! Methods serving pharmacy are okay and may fundamentally help fix the problem of mental health, because some people who trust and buy and take time to use their drugs say it helps them!  Maybe don’t develop this? If you are intending to..  Psychiatry is corrupted by chemical manufacture right now and it’s time immemorially wanting for honour.  I think your morality is looking for neurologists."
algotrading;dlfujr;1571739315.0;/r/algotrading/comments/dlfujr/a_performant_backtesting_system/;A performant backtesting system?;"Hi,I'm a beginner in quantitive trading trying to build my setup for backtesting and optimizing strategies.For quite some time I've been playing around with [Backtrader](https://www.backtrader.com) which is written in Python. After reading ""Building Winning Algorithmic Trading Systems"" book I've tried to implement a walk-forward analysis in Backtrader and load some real data from Binance.A case was loading 1 year of 15m data from 77 markets. In total it is \~1.6m candles. The reason I add that much data is that I want as real & thorough simulation as possible before I let the strategy work with the real money. Backtrader wasn't able to even iterate through the data w/o indicator calculation. I've tried to use Jython and PyPy to speed things up, but that didn't help.I've started implementing my own backtesting system designed after Backtrader (at least top-level API) in C++17. From the very beginning, it became clear that a pile of subtleties is higher than the sky (commissions, slippage, position tracking, complex order types (bracketed, trailing, ...), synchronous data iteration, making sure there's no look-ahead bias, ....).At this point, I understand that to get some properly working usable prototype I'll have to spend 2-3 months of time on that thing. And that'll be the very first step.So before jumping into that one I've compiled a list of requirements and look around for anything matching:* C++ / Python API* Runs on Linux* Able to work fast with big data sets (4+G)* Able to load data from files (not married with some online services, I'll provide the data)* Parameter optimization (brute force, some genetic algorithms with annealing, LMA, ... more is better here)* Walk-forward out of the box* Monte Carlo and other risk estimations* Usual strategy metrics (max drawdown, net/gross profit, commissions calculations, won/lost orders, Sharpe ratio, ...)* Costs some sane amount of $$$I've googled and found only [QuantConnect Lean](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean) engine, but it lacks documentation and even after I've managed to load all the data into it it was pretty slow. Also, there's [gobacktest](https://github.com/dirkolbrich/gobacktest) that looks promising, but I didn't get there yet.Are there any other products I'm missing?Thanks!P. S. My plan B is moving to Windows and subscribing to MultiCharts (along with learning C#), but that's the last resort.";"Aren't we all beginners in `quantum trading`#Zorro#The closest thing I can think of is Lean. At least open source, anyway.  Tbh you’re going to be better off building your own. It’s a huge PITA laying the groundwork, but the benefits are that you have an intimate understanding of every single calculation, bottleneck, assumption, and potential bias. Plus you might learn a new thing or two along the way.#From all the requirements you list, it seems running on Linux might be the toughest. I am maintaining my own backtesting engine, and even though it is coded in C# (which in theory is cross-platform), there are ultimately a lot of Windows dependencies. For the pure backtesting engine, these are mainly introduced by the data feeds, and for the application by the UI toolkit.  I have started working on my own engine after becoming frustrated with MultiCharts. I used MultiCharts for 5 years. It is very well maintained, they add great new features with every release, and they typically fix the most annoying bugs. The design works very well for strategies running on single assets, or independent baskets of strategies. However, I found the architecture to have many painful issues when it comes to true portfolio strategies requiring back and forth communication between an overarching portfolio/ money-management and a number of child strategies. Your mileage may vary. If you still consider buying MultiCharts, watch out for Black Friday deals.  Cheers!#Good question. Interesting topic. I don't have any answers though. I know what you're talking about when you say all the subtleties when creating your own. I'm working on one in C# for Windows right now. I'll let you know if it turns out to be state of the art haham#Interesting thread! I'm the founder of QuantConnect. We are constantly working on speed but the speed depends on what the algorithm is going. Depending on what you're doing it can range from 10k/sec up to 800k/sec with options data. The more ""dense"" the data, the faster in ""candles/points"" it benchmarks but we're well on our way to 1M events a second. I'd recommend against the C++ route! You'd be better to use LEAN-C# if speed is your first concern.#2-3 years is more realistic..."

investing;df4fa1;1570560994.0;/r/investing/comments/df4fa1/splunk_financials_and_underlying_story/;Splunk Financials and Underlying Story;"Following my last post, I received a request to take a deeper dive into Splunk (SPLK), a rapidly growing company in the IT Operations Management (ITOM) space. One quick note before I kick off, I might reorganize these posts just to give them a bit more structure, which may evolve as time goes on.**Industry**Splunk fits within an interesting niche of the ITOM space. Their specialization is part of an area focused on machine learning and big data for logging, monitoring, and reporting IT Operations. To quote from [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3892967?ref=mrktg-srch) and [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/01/09/the-big-problem-with-big-data/#4d89199723b1), ""By 2022, 40% of all large enterprises will combine big data and machine learning functionality to support and partially replace monitoring, service desk and automation processes and tasks."" Given the upside, there are a ton of [vendors](https://blog.opsramp.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog_images/AIOps%20Vendor%20Landscape@2x-100.jpg?width=3840&name=AIOps%20Vendor%20Landscape@2x-100.jpg) craming into a very crowded market. In [Gartner's](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3939625/market-share-analysis-itom-performance-analysis-software) most recent report, the market size is $5.2B and grew at 12% YoY, also [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190423005350/en/Splunk-Increases-Market-Share-Gartner’s-Performance-Analysis). **Revenue**For Splunk, their (reported) revenue is broken down into 3 main categories: Licensing, Maintenance and Services, and Cloud. The License line is a one-time payment for a perpetual license for on-premise deployment of the Splunk Enterprise suite, while the maintenance and service and cloud license pay an annual subscription fee, which is tiered based on the amount of data ingested. Their revenue is rapidly transitioning from the perpetual license to the their annual subscription as they said in their most recent [earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/08/22/splunk-inc-splk-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx) ""We expect the elimination of perpetual license sales will accelerate renewable mix to 99% in Q4 and high 90s for the full-year."" [seen here](https://imgur.com/CX7RqQ).This transition has a bit of uncertainty around it. Exabeam, one of Splunk's competitors in the SIEM space, recently [mentioned](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2019/06/14/exabeams-fast-growth-not-slowing-down-splunk/#70e6bad1c36b) that customers are unable to predict their expenditure since Splunk prices based on data ingested, which can be a varying target. Additionally, the cloud transition provides a more sticky cash flow for the company, but will provide short-term pain since the amounts are billed annually vs. entirely upfront. While this might help customers from an initial expenditure outlay (potentially removing one of the roadblocks), it is the reason that Splunk recently revised their cash flow forecast from a positive $250mm inflow to a negative $300mm outflow (despite raising annual guidance from $2.25B to $2.3B). The critical KPI for the company here is their [Remaining Performance Obligations](https://investors.splunk.com/static-files/4333fe85-6fc8-40cc-b56d-60e4527281cb), which is non-cancellable (future) contracted revenue. In 2Q20, the RPO was [$1.235B](https://imgur.com/pr7Rxh7), with 61% of that to be recognized over the next twelve months ($753mm). The average contract duration for the contracts signed have hovered just shy of 3 years (33 months). One concerning metric in their most recent quarter was that the contract bookings slowed dramatically in the most recent quarter, $554mm, which is only a 19% growth rate.Finally, Splunk just [closed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000141057819001502/tv530497_8k.htm) on their acquisition of SignalFX on October 1st, so guidance and RPO will likely look dramatically different in Q3 and Q4 as the company represents a combined platform.**Costs**From a cost perspective, the company's costs have stayed broadly consistent with [topline growth](https://imgur.com/hOrLe5P). On an LTM basis, the company has ~$1.8B of expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles. The number of employees has grown from 2,700, to 3,200, to 4,400, to 4,700 from Jan-2017, Jan-2018, to Jan-2019, and today respectively. Assuming an average total compensation of [$261,231](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000120677419001555/splk3465081-def14a.htm#CEOPayRatio), accounts for ~$1.15B of those expenses or ~72% for FY19. This has remained relatively constant for 2015 to current.As a result, cloud margins are improving, as 2Q20 reached a 50% margin, nearing their 70% gross margin target. Research and Development has remained relatively constant at 15 - 17.5% of sales, sales and marketing at 45% - 50% of sales, and G&A at ~10% of sales. These percentages strip out stock-based compensation, but since there is no breakdown, still include D&A. **Capitalization**Splunk is well funded with 2 convertible senior notes (convertible at $148.30) for a total debt of $2.1B, but has $2.7B in cash and investments. This gives the company a great war-chest to continue to acquire companies in the space. The company has acquired [7 companies](https://imgur.com/xW8hmli) in the past 2 years, with the most notable being SignalFX, augmenting their suite of products in the monitoring segment. **Returns**Over the last 4 - 5 quarters, Splunk's return on capital has settled into the [5 - 10% range](https://imgur.com/hOrLe5P). Given their reinvestment rate of ~150% (math from [here on p 26](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/ovhds/dam2ed/growthandtermvalue.pdf)), this implies a sustainable EBIT growth rate of 7 - 10%. To me, this passes the smell test since it's broadly consistent with the industry growth predicted by IDC and Gartner, implying that Splunk's organic revenue growth will continue and acquisitions should provide further juice to the topline growth rate. **Outlook**Splunk issued guidance of $2.3B for FY2020, with $600mm in Q3 (implying ~$760mm in Q4). Wall street is right in line with guidance for 2020, and showing $2.8B for 2021 (or a 22% growth rate). The challenge for the company will be to weather the transition from the upfront payment to the cloud subscriptions, since that will depress cash flow for the next year or two. The company even noted on their last [earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/08/22/splunk-inc-splk-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx) that their target cash flow yield won't be realized until after 2021.TL DR Splunk is a rapidly growing player in the IT Operations Management space that is growing dramatically and starting the shift into turning their revenue stream into longer-term contracts. As the company transitions, it will depress cash flow in the near-term, but could accelerate onboarding as it manages the initial expense outlay for customers. Images [here](https://imgur.com/a/YvuAVhI). As per usual excel available if requested.Excel [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pz61bn0029rpg3k/SPLK.xlsx?dl=0)";As someone that works with SIEM and other tools in this space, splunks new licensing model is an untenable solution for rapidly growing businesses, and businesses that are watching their bottom line. They've had a monopoly in the SIEM space for the past few years, but with elastic's offerings, and google getting into the space with backstory, both being at much more competitive price points, I'd say that  things are going to start swinging against splunk.#elasticsearch
AUfrugal;djxiyb;1571450627.0;/r/AUfrugal/comments/djxiyb/telstra_mobile_foxtel_and_nbn/;Telstra Mobile, Foxtel and NBN;I'm going to MIL's this week to try and find better deals for them on the above.  They NEED to have mobiles with Telstra for reception and to keep their ancient email addresses. They travel, so need big data caps. Phones are owned outright.FIL won't budge on Fox sport and news (unless there's a streaming option maybe? But their tv is 20 odd years old, no way to connect it. He'd have to watch on iPad or mobile so that's unsure.) They enjoy a lot of BBC series type stuff, some docos, some lifestyle (like building and cooking, not reality drama) together. They have kids for our kids but that's 100% not necessary.They have no home internet. TPG have a $30 deal. I feel this would allow them to possibly reduce Foxtel spend by adding streaming options, and reduce phone cap needed, or let them vary it month by month. They need big caps when travelling in their caravan, up to a couple months at a time. MIL is resistant because they won't use the NBN while travelling. It's HAVE to bring overall cost down to convince her. They would LOOOOVE a ton of Netflix and Prime shows though! I've looked at deals and it's so confusing! JB HIFI have way better Telstra deals than Telstra online, but I've phoned Telstra before and they matched a JB deal with an extra 5% off. They are pensioners and seniors, if that helps?;"Foxtel Now works with Chromecast or a Foxtel Now Box and there's PLENTY of kids content on ABC iView.  Edit: Netflix isn't officially supported on the Foxtel Now Box.#The best deals you will get through Foxtel at the moment involve calling up and cancelling due to the high costs. They are struggling at the moment to retain customers with the industry disrupters like Netflix. I regularly ""cancel"" with them and have been on my current package of $29 per month for basic + sport + HD for 2 years. They might not give you a deal that good in the first round but you can certainly get them to lower their price simply by telling them you are looking to disconnect and telling them it's due to the price and you are looking at cheaper alternatives.      Telstra seems to give the better deals online, rather than through their phone or shop fronts. They aren't as good as resellers of other carriers price wise but have a look online and see if you can get into some live chat and tell the operator you are looking at this deal \[insert competitior\] is offering and wondered if they could lower their \[x plan\] to be more competitive.  &#x200B   NBN is a hard one.. sometimes you pay for what you get as a fair few ISP's oversubscribe. If they don't need fast internet though it's pretty hard to beat TPG's pricing.#Kayo is cheaper than foxtel for sports. So if you can sort out the news they like to watch, and their TV that's an option. You'll likely never get a ""great"" deal on telstra stuff but if they have an ipad with sim card prepaid stuff can have pretty big bonus data. Alternatively dual sim phone's are an option for the future (and in my experience cheaper than aussie version. Get them off ebay).  Sadly though you'll never save much money with such a long list of ""must have"" stuff. If they can live without having data *everywhere* they travel they'll get better deals. If they figure out a better way to get their news they can save a lot by using kayo or depending on what sports they want to watch there's stuff like telstra nrl app to stream. If they have 2 phones they can always use one on telstra with cheap unlimited calls and another carrier on the other for big cheap data. If they don't update their TV though there's a lot of cheaper options they'll miss out on. Might be worth pointing out that (depending on size) they could save more money long term by buying a cheap TV now (gumtree will have plenty).#JB Hi fi often do mobile deals for SIM only plans, $500 gift card for port in customers, 65pm, 60gb data. If your number is with Telstra, port out to Vodafone and apply for port in to telstra using in HIFI. Vodafone is cheapest nbn, I personally use Aussie broadband, and ex telstra combo for telstra so it's only 35, uncoupled from bundle (I just put a formal.complaint in for the etcs)#Go with Aldi for mobiles, cheaper than, but still uses Telstra :)#Can they pay Telstra to keep their emails (I know some other providers allow you to pay $5 a month or so to do so after leaving)? Their plans are incredibly expensive and boost use the same network at a fraction of the cost.#My 85 year old dad had a bigpond email for years, now he’s got a gmail one. It actually wasn’t as much of a drama as you think it’ll be.   Start the change now, email everyone they know that the new address is xxx and the old won’t work soon.  And send new updates a week later from the new address etc and it will be sorted.   Telstra has Belong for mobiles and broadband so is an option.  Fox sports can be streaming now but not as easy for older people to use, satellite it better for them and can watch all channels on one box and record stuff they like.

sales;diypeh;1571273117.0;/r/sales/comments/diypeh/breaking_into_high_dollar_saas_jobs/;Breaking into high dollar SaaS jobs?;[deleted];Have you searched for Account Executive or Business Development Representative roles in your area? Those are very common SaaS terms.#If you're making $180k now WITHOUT the sales stress, just stay with what you're doing.#Very few companies are going to hire someone who is not currently in an individual contributor role and with no such experience into a senior selling role which is where you will find that money.    I have seen people go from SE to sales, but it starts with a move within the same company where they have the relationships to pull it off.  Once proven, you can then jump ship and having both sales and SE on the resume will be a great look.  Depending on your company that may require a short term step back in base at least, and maybe total OTE.  Up to you if you believe in yourself and want it bad enough to take that risk.#Most companies don’t advertise for above and beyond. My OTE has always been lower than what I’ve actually made. Most people on here posting that they’re making 200k+ are not your average worker. There are plenty of people in my office who put in the bare minimum and are ok with their base and low % of commission. There’s the 80/20 rule in sales and if you want to make the big numbers work harder than 80% of your coworkers.

The technology is integrated with others, such as big data and artificial intelligence, to build a national surveillance and data-sharing platform.* In 2019, China announced that the third generation of Resident Identity Cards will be able to trace location.

A lot of third world, developing nations are going to follow the lead of China as they industrialize, because China is showing said nations there's an alternative means of industrializing other than modeling yourself on Western democracy. This is because the Chinese model is more beneficial to those in power.  > Compared to other countries (or at least other high income democracies), can you see the United States being more like China in this aspect as time goes on? If so, what ""Techno-Police-State"" things can you see the United States doing?  Yes, very much so. Privacy laws aren't keeping pace with technology, so dystopian things like excessive surveillance are unfortunately to be expected. That said, I don't think the US or any other Western democracy will be quite as *blatant* and authoritarian as China, but you're insane if you think there's no mass surveillance in Western society.  > Can you see the world as a whole being more like China in this aspect as time goes on?  Yes. As technology continues to advance, and society starts feeling the strain from climate change, governments are going to need better means of controlling its citizens, which said technology will provide. It will seem dystopian to us, but not necessarily to those who grow up in it.  It's unfortunate, and it's a great fear of mine, but that's my opinion on where the world is headed.#America would never mass-spy on its own citizens...  )#All of them, eventually. Most of this stuff we already do in the US on some level as well  China is just more blunt about it.#Welcome to the Good ole US of A, where we do not have a police state. No sirree#It's pretty much inevitable that all the authoritarian governments will adopt similar technology.  It's also pretty much inevitable that all the democratic governments will \*also\* adopt this technology, just in private, among partnerships and contracts between a small number of dominant firms.#All countries to some extent. In the developed world I think the country that will go for this will be the UK. They already have in place things that would not fly in most modern democracies.  I think the situation will get worse if the leave the EU. If northern Ireland and Scotland leave the UK, things will get ugly.#Yes, the US"

Will it?;Let me just get this out of the way, I hate Facebook.  It's been a couple of years since I've purged my information from that cesspool.  However, I have to be honest when I say I do miss connecting with people in that convenient manner.  But I will not sacrifice my personal data or my privacy for their monetary gain.  Has Eich ever talked about launching a privacy centric social media platform that could possibly have BAT as a build in currency for tipping, ad revenue and purchases etc?  Someone has to challenge the cyber retardation that is Facebook.  Shit is getting out of control.  I get that it's hard to stop the Big Data machine and that private data is now worth just about as much as oil.  But goddamn, wouldn't it be nice to have a choice?;"The comments from Brendan around social and email have been “can’t build Rome in a day” but I do believe the aspirations are there.#First, make brave full complete(1.0) and Im okay with privacy chat, privacy social media, privacy pizza hut, etc...#I know 4chan isn't very popular on this website, but I'm dying for a crypto-focused anonymous imageboard where users can send and receive BAT, completely anonymously. There are obvious difficulties surrounding the idea but the potential is there.#Self promotion here but I think it's relevant. We are building [www.publish0x.com](https://www.publish0x.com) , it is modelled after Medium/Steemit style rather than facebook if you like - crypto content/blogging with tipping - but our tips are in 3 tokens currently with an 80% chance of the (free) tip you generate (for yourself and the author) being BAT! Personally I am a very big BAT/Brave fan and think it is a good fit, and we are not funded/endorsed/sponsored by Brave in any way, but we are starting to chat to them and hope to further BAT-ify. Possibly   * Give higher rewards for visiting using the Brave Browser. * Filtering down your share of BAT contributions ala Youtube style to our authors/users. * *\* both of these things need permission / a little extra coding help from Brave themselves, and I understand they have higher traffic sites/partners to integrate with first but we are growing so I hope we make the list :P*  Also would like to add disclaimers that   * we are centralised (but then so is the Brave browser) * Our tips/transactions are NOT onchain, i.e each individual tip instance isnt, but again it is a weekly withdrawal batch payment onchain - again similar to BAT via Uphold monthly batching. * Again, want to make clear that we are centralised, and NOT a ""dapp"", it's the fastest way to build - build first and ""dapp-ify"" later and integrate with various projects who let us  do kyc, stamp content to their blockchain, host videos decentralised, etc.#Check out Holochain"

With the advancement of blockchain technology, many industries are closely watching the benefits that blockchain can provide for them as new developments make blockchain more feasible for contemporary applications. The process to upgrade legacy systems in various industries as big data becomes increasingly important marks a huge technological turning point for our society. These industries involve major sectors in the world’s economy such as finance, education, and health care, to name a few. Within this article, we’ll delve into the benefits that blockchain can provide for the healthcare industry in particular.***Application of Blockchain to the Healthcare Industry***Healthcare is a field that is developing more than ever before, with a huge influx of IT infrastructure in the market to help doctors and nurses perform their jobs more efficiently and ensure patient health management at a superior level. With personal health records, medical drugs and instruments, hospitals and clinics have an ever-growing list of new things to keep track of and learn from. This increase of information derives the need for a data management system for hospital workers to access, edit, and extrapolate data in a fast and efficient way. Blockchain has a lot of qualities to make these information exchanges more secure, efficient, and interoperable.Focusing on quality health care services means creating a superior health management standard at all times. There are constant improvements needed with many hospitals running on older legacy systems. These technical inefficiencies can cost doctors and nurses valuable time and resources.***How a Third-Generation Blockchain Like Cardano Can Offer Benefits for the Healthcare Industry***Multiple variables come into play in patient care. With the advent of blockchain technology, medical workers are able to get near real-time updates across an information network for all parties involved in the provision of healthcare services. Identity verification and stored patient data can quickly pull up a patient's health history to determine the best course of action.&#x200B **\*\***[**Continue reading on our website**](https://emurgo.io/en/blog/blockchain-benefits-for-healthcare/newsletter);

Find a couple smart college kids as interns that know python and explore the variety of python libraries (scikit, numpy, pandas) or the various other open source things out there provided by folks like linked in, Facebook, Lyft, Netflix, etc.  freely available algorithms like FB prophet and things like that before you spend money on a bunch of buzzwords like “data scientist” and “ Hadoop” among other things that a majority of companies don’t really need.#Yes it is. But Most companies don’t need it and it is a dying technology. Just ask Hortonworks. Most use cases can be handled with emr using s3 and spark.  Little to know knowledge of Hadoop is required. Hadoop administration is a TON of work and is why many have moved away from it unless you are already stuck with it and it have a lot of money to support all of the hardware.#I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

privacy;djn128;1571402934.0;/r/privacy/comments/djn128/why_do_americans_not_care_about_privacy/;Why do Americans not care about privacy?;I have the general idea of Americans, that they don't really care about internet privacy, especially when it comes to rights to their own images. Even on platforms as reddit, where one would think users in general have a broader consciousness about privacy, surveilance and big data, people constantly upload pitcures and videos of them, family members, friends and strangers or talk about sensitive private informations. Even more upsetting is the trend towards smart home gadgets, like Alexa etc. where companies directly (and proven in lots of cases) spy on you.As I write this text I am aware of the fact, that even with multiple add-ons (eg script blocker, cookie delete etc.) and VPN I leave traces online. Also I know, that one has to trade private data for comfort (eg smartphones  I feel bad about this specific matter btw). And also I realize that most people in Europe don't really care about privacy (so no 'superiority' here). But I have the feeling that most Americans care even less, as the mentioned limitless data-collection, both state- and commercial-wise, aren't really a matter of public discourse (or am I wrong ?).;"It's not just Americans, it's everyone. An overwhelming majority of people do not understand technology, others just think the convenience is worth the price.#This mentality exists not just in America. It's everywhere.  As for why, I believe it's a combination of ignorance, being conditioned by the modern media/Governments to give up privacy because ""save the children"" and ""for the fight against terrorism,"" and because people have become accustomed to giving up privacy to services like Facebook because it's free (as in no financial cost to join).#We Americans are trained from a young age to be perfect consumers. A large demographic here also has been trained their entire life to be state dependent. To put it bluntly we are lazy and so long as we get the fun mind numbing distraction that’s offered free/cheap we, as a whole, don’t care the cost.#People have way too many other things to worry about. Paying bills, making sure they can afford healthcare, making sure they can afford food for their families. Most people just don't have the mental space to care about it. The time they spend on the internet is time for them to relax and not worry about things. I agree that they SHOULD be worrying about it. But, unfortunately, this is the end result of late stage capitalism. It's stressful for people who aren't well off. And that stress means they don't have the energy to care about relatively niche concerns.#As an American I agree with you.  When I talk about why I don’t share certain images and why I avoid certain websites people look at me like I’ve grown a second head or something.  I don’t get it.  I don’t have an answer for you just commiserating!"
YangForPresidentHQ;dg9naz;1570766268.0;/r/YangForPresidentHQ/comments/dg9naz/question_about_the_vat/;Question about the VAT;So a major talking point of Yang’s is that Amazon paid $0 in federal income tax last year. He implies that this could be rectified by implementing a VAT in which big data companies would pay their fair share through every Amazon sale, Facebook ad, etc..My question is, wouldn’t the consumer be the one paying the VAT? How does this ensure Amazon pays their fair share?Thanks;"Please remember we are here as a representation of Andrew Yang.

Also many tech companies will have VAT on advertisement, automation, etc. 50% of VAT on point of sale is usually consumed by the company. Look up VAT in Europe. All big tech companies pay VAT there. Look it up how much of it passed along.#So Amazon is going to pay a lot of VAT in their supply chain. Every time they buy some robot arms, a computer system or an advertising service.  So the natural question then is, wouldn't they just pass on 100% of the new cost to consumers?  The answer is no, because that's just not how business works.  Passing on 100% of a new cost to existing consumers is a recipe for disaster.   Amazon still has strong competition out there from box stores, etsy, eBay or buying direct from manufacturer.  This is where price sensitivity and competition force companies to swallow many of these costs.  On average the passthrough rate for VAT is around 50%.  Another thing to consider is that there are two forces at play where retail prices may actually go down in the long run.  One of them is automation ... which is the whole point of the UBI.  The more Amazon can automate their business, the lower their costs become.  And another force is the UBI itself.  More Americans have money which means more consumer demand.  Higher sales volume also places downward pressure on prices.#Hi, check out Yang’s website: https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/  “ First, not all goods will be subject to the VAT. Staples such as groceries and clothing will be excluded from the VAT.  Second, the assumption that the entire VAT would get passed on to consumers is incorrect. Consumers are price sensitive, and the demand for most goods is at least somewhat elastic. While prices will likely increase on many goods, the increase will, for the most part, be smaller than the VAT as producers find more efficient ways to produce goods and adjust prices to maximize profitability.  Finally, an individual would have to buy a lot of non-exempt items in order to “cancel out” the value of the UBI. Assuming all goods are subject to a VAT and the entire VAT is passed on to consumers, an individual would have to buy $120,000 worth of items before the extra costs associated with a VAT “use up” their UBI. As stated above, those two assumptions are wrong, and most people aren’t spending nearly that much money.”#It is similar to the VAT, called a GST (goods and services tax), introduced in Australia in July 2000. 10% value-added tax for goods and services with exemptions for things such as meat and potatoes.  So if you buy AWS time from Amazon, you may may get charged an extra 10% which goes to the gov't. It is not quite as simple as that though as it gets added on the way through the supply chain and subtracted by the inputs. A biz pays the nett to the gov't. Amazon would collect 10% on its sales, subtract the VAT it paid, and send the balance to the gov't.  That is, everyone pays a little along the chain according to ""value"" and deducts their VAT inputs.  Prices don't simply go up 10% in many cases.  Again, this is not simply the biz marking up their cost and adding an extra 10% as that business selling you the good or service gets back the VAT they paid on the input side. It obviously gets a bit more intricate for products that are a mix of VAT and zero-rated inputs. But wait, there is more...  It is not just about the direct cost of goods and service inputs incorporated into the thing sold as a biz will claim back VAT paid on indirect items too, e.g. their HR system license fees, stationery, etc. You tally the VAT collected subtract the VAT paid, and send (usually) or receive (especially for export biz) the balance from the gov't. For example, if you export a lot, your sales are zero-rated, so you don't receive VAT and you'll likely end up getting a cheque from the gov't refunding your VAT paid. This nett amount is normally offset with your pay-as-you-earn employee taxes so it is not always that a business gets funds back but, yes, the gov't may send you a cheque. So, it's complicated in a beautiful value-added way.  **Concrete example**  Australia introduced a similar ten per cent VAT in July 2000. The result was reconciled after the fact to be a \~2.5% CPI effect:  >*""TNTS \[VAT\] is estimated to have contributed around 2½ percentage points of this increase.""*  That said, the immediate impact was little under 3%, slightly higher than the overall annual outcome indicating some settling occurred,  >*""The main price effect was recorded in the September quarter 2000, with the CPI rising by 3.7 per cent. TNTS \[VAT\] is estimated to have contributed a little less than 3 percentage points to the overall CPI increase in the quarter, significantly lower than the 3¾ percentage points forecast in the 2000-01 Budget. Quarterly inflation outcomes, while exhibiting some volatility, generally returned to more typical levels from the December quarter 2000. This single 'spike' in the quarterly CPI data confirms that the inflationary impact of the TNTS \[VAT\] reforms on prices was essentially once-off in nature and did not become entrenched in inflation outcomes or inflation expectations.""*  Source: [http://archive.treasury.gov.au/documents/580/HTML/docshell.asp?URL=New\_Tax\_System.asp](http://archive.treasury.gov.au/documents/580/HTML/docshell.asp?URL=New_Tax_System.asp)  **How will it affect me?**  A reasonable expectation may be that you take a \~3% hit as a consumer with the Yang plan. Then the question becomes, ""Is a $12,000 Freedom Dividend each a year enough compensation for the \~3% hit you may take?""   If your spending per year (not income) is less than $400,000 per year (12k / 0.03), or $800,000 as a couple, you're probably going to be better off.  A VAT is regressive but combined with UBI, the Yang plan is very progressive. That's the magic of the Yang plan combo. It's a smart move and perhaps a once in a lifetime opportunity for the US of A.#Think of it like for every product that comes into the country from amazon and what not there is gonna be a slight Vat to it Probs being 5C to a dollar and when you have huge shipments it adds up quickly.For the Average American family its not gonna be a huge Expense you might have to pay a extra 5 dollars for a full cart of groceries but with the UBI its gonna subset it.#Thank you, everyone. Very helpful information!   I’m totally on board. Yang 2020!"

But I also belive that if the Valve Ondex would have been avaiable to everyone from the start and if there would be a nice valve vr title *caught*HL3*caught*They would sell way better.What do you guys think? Now that there are finally some numbers;"46,000 units ($30-46 million revenue depending on which kit people bought) is really good for the first 5 months of a first generation product in a niche market. I would imagine Valve is pretty happy with the reception. They were back ordered for several months so they obviously weren't expecting to sell 10x as many or anything like that. And they still haven't opened it up to all countries, which they would if they were hurting for sales.  Valve also makes money selling VR games to Oculus headset owners on Steam. So Valve's focus is not solely on Index sales the way Oculus's focus is essentially solely on on Oculus headsets. Revive is great for the small subset of enthusiasts who use it, but Oculus obviously isn't counting on that for Oculus store sales.#Road to VR used to do a monthly analysis from the Steam Hardware & Software Survey.

I had to restart the survey for the Index to be recognized and even then it did not manage to detect my controllers, only the headset.#You can link the more extensive English article which is listed as their source at the bottom of their article:  [https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/24/superdata-facebook-sold-180000-oculus-quests-in-q3-2019/](https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/24/superdata-facebook-sold-180000-oculus-quests-in-q3-2019/)  &#x200B   I'm not a native German speaker but it is good to train my German once in a while :) I'm currently chasing sources because I cannot find where they got the Index number from.  &#x200B   EDIT: Apparently you have to pay 1500 dollar to see how they got their numbers...#Also keep in mind that the Index isn’t available worldwide yet.#who cares how much they've sold?   &#x200B   just judge the product on how good it is, the support it has and the quality of service you've received.  &#x200B   sales numbers is a pathetic metric for measuring the only high end VR headset.#So the only reason a vr user wouldn't get the index is its cost. It's the best system and revive runs near perfect usually. I've always assumed that until valve was shipping essentially world wide we wont get an announcement.  Once everyone has the ability to purchase the index you will see the game announcement. It would actually be a bad marketing move to announce the game before world wide shipping. This would incline people to purchase a rift s to play hlvr.#I think its selling okay but Valve is reluctant to boast about the sales since they are busy with returned units.

The technologies that would I learn would help me move into a Data Engineering role[1]. However, I am concerning that the data gathering/mining that I would be doing for an employer would potentially involve the personal information of U.S. or other citizens that could potentially be exploited.Any thoughts on if this is an employment area that Christians should be wary of? Any Data Engineers/Scientists out there who are willing to Chime in and let me know if they have any privacy concerns related to their work?[1] https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-engineering-a-quick-and-simple-definition;Not all data science or big data jobs deal with human data. Some use sensor data from a car or factory. Predictive diagnosis of failures in a system. Optimize a production pipeline. Some fold proteins or analyze chemical properties to try to predict others' properties. Et cetera. In the media these common applications often go unmentioned because there is little controversial about them (high frequency trading being a notable exception).  I used to be a data scientist and would prefer to still be. Mind you, I worked with unique (consented) data sets.  One company specialized in determining purchase intent to generate sales leads for our customers. They did they by harvesting tweets and figuring out traits of the person (number of pets, income, married/unmarried, job, city, etc....). It was scary both how accurate we could be and how many of these traits won't explicitly mentioned by the people. But, at the end of the day, the data was public that people willingly submitted to the world.  Another few companies I worked with made security software for MLS portals and lead generation for MLS portals. The dataset was people using an MLS. A somewhat voluntary set of people. The ones the security software was being used on literally were aware of it, signed a contract, and were actively informed that software was in place that monitored them.  Some of the data sets are obtained less than consensually. One type that comes up infrequently but ignites the news is things like Cambridge Analytica. A person for a few dollars or an entry into a competition hands over all their friends' data by clicking some button with vague sounding permissions. I'd be fine working on this type of dataset depending on what it was used for.#I've followed the privacy issues around technology for a couple years now, and I tend to err on the side of privacy.  I think it probably comes down to how much you trust that your employer wants to keep its customers' data secure.  Historically, most companies that have had the capability to gather customer data have not kept it secure very well, or used it for customers' interest.  I guess it's up to you how much you trust your employer to do the right thing.#Was never a data engineer, but on the sales side of data modeling.  Pretty scary what they can find.  Had a Christian non-profit looking to build up their donor database.  Told me that their ideal donor was a mainline Christian who lived within 50 miles of a major metropolitan area and had at least a master's degree.  Specifically on the east coast and west coast.  Sent off the request to my data engineer and a week later he came back with a list.  Cost them almost $5 a name and address, but they ended up buying a few thousand addresses from me.#[deleted]

This is not some startup, this is a fairly large company with over 4billion annual revenue.   This is not meant for a humble brag or anything like that, but I am worried that if I take this position it could hurt me possibly in 1-2 years if I want to hop to a new company.  I'm afraid that won't take me seriously and think I am esentially lying on my resume if it lists Lead Big Data Architect as my previous role and I only have 3 years experience.  I eventually want to be a big data/cloud architect.   Is this a valid concern?  The salary is pretty incredible, 165K base, in low COL area.   Would I be crazy to pass this up?  This is not meant as a humble brag, just seems to good to be true, and could possibly hurt my career after this job.;"You are stupid. Obviously take it.#""This job is so good and pays so well that I'm worried people won't believe how truly big my dong is when I tell them I worked there.""  You definitely don't want those problems. Don't take it. In fact, I'd probably get out of software altogether and become an alpaca farmer somewhere in the Midwest.#You are not bragging because you don’t have a fucking offer yet.  lol#This appears to be a senior-ish role.   For positions as a senior, the company is looking for stability. The question of “were should we be in five years, and how will we get there” is asked of architects.   If you leave in a year or two, and I was looking for another architect and your resume was one that I’d have to consider... I’d look more to someone who wanted to settle down and solve the problems that took half a decade rather than jumping from role to role.   If you want to settle down, it would be a good position. If you are still looking for new things and will move to another before the roadmap is on its way... look to other positions rather than architect roles#lol no, take it if you get it, nothing about that will hurt your career. only thing is that the job might be difficult at that level, so be prepared to deal with stresses#What company is this?!"

Need some suggestion.;Hi everyone,&#x200B I work for a big N company. Previously I used to work on large scale services/ML and big data and I enjoyed my job so much. I absolutely love my job as a software developer to be honest and I don't think I would enjoy any other job as much as I enjoy software development.&#x200B But my current team sucks. The team is almost on the verge of getting dissolved. The only reason I might want to stay in the current team is because it might be easier to get promoted here, which could give me a hike of 20-30k.&#x200B But lately, I have been hating working here so much that In don't even know if it is worth it. Should I leave my current team and go work at a place I like? I might jeopardize my chances at promotion but I would honestly enjoy my job a lot at these places.&#x200B Have you ever been a situation like this?;A promotion is usually not worth anything these days (maybe 2-5% at most companies). It would be better to stay until you find another job, then quit. Job hopping can pay a lot more.#I have a simple advice - it you hate something that much that it can even cause you mental problems, just leave it. No money can pay this price. Go whenever you think u will feel comfortably (with the workplace, money, etc.)#Don't stay anywhere that you're miserable just for more money. That's no way to live life.  If you want to leave, leave. The money will all work itself out. Focus on making yourself happy first.

A bunch of people also told me that I'd be a great teacher and I like the idea to help teens find their way in life and have a positive influence on them.Now the big problem here is pretty much the money, with a good degree in CompSci I can make a lot more than in teaching and I also don't want to ""throw away"" my degree.So I thought about teaching part-time, to kinda do both.  Is anyone here doing something like this and can talk a bit about how it is?General recommendations would be great. I'm mostly thinking about highschool-level because I would love to use my knowledge.Ohh and I'm currently in the UK, so if anyone knows what kind of training/courses/degrees I would have to get, just let me know.";There’s a lot of volunteer work that involves teaching students especially about computers. You might want to look up if the local Boys and Girls club has programs that interest you or if you could help an organization like Girls Who Code or something similar.  Volunteering for one of these organizations or a nearby school would be the closest experience to guiding students and helping them like you do with friends. Being an actual teacher is way more work and a huge commitment for very little compensation.#I'm not sure how you'd go into teaching part time without training. You'd need to go full time to train then apply for part time roles. You'd need to go through a PGCE at uni or some kind of SCITT program.  I teach CS and you need to brace yourself for the extraordinary level of computer illiteracy you will be facing. Most of them have never seen a computer before#Substitute teaching maybe?#Why in God’s creation would you teach for pennies with a degree in big data?#Computer science is a huge initiative in NYC the DOE launched the CS4ALL program that has been amazing and is spreading through public schools like wild fire. Teachers with computer science background are becoming more in demand. I have a bilingual education license and have started learning about integrating computer science for about 2 years. I love it, what I love must of all is how cs teaches students perseverance, a skill transferable and essential in every core subject.

We are looking to change the way large companies gather ""big data"", and are hoping to help bring some of the profits back down to consumers. The idea: With big data quickly becoming one of the more profitable industries on the market today, companies are constantly trying new ways to gather data about the every day user. This interaction is largely anti-consumer, and only profitable to major corporations. The idea behind Airo.Life’s be free phone project is to help get some of that money back into the hands of the consumer. The phone is funded by non-intrusive content ads that are atop of the device during use of the phone, as well as the standard data that is already being collected by using a smartphone in the digital era. With this transaction, users are opting in to their data collection, but actually benefitting from the transaction by means of a free physical cell phone device as well as a call/text/data plan for the device. This could save individuals roughly $50/month or more, as well as up to $200/month for families. All this while having potentially some of the highest viewership for advertisers  a real mutually beneficial transaction.The campaign:As a way to draw attention to the project and to help do our part during the current climate crisis, we are running an advertising campaign which will allow people to help the world by helping us plant trees – another mutually beneficial transaction. We will be planting 100 trees per share, 20 trees per like, and more per donation on our currently running Indiegogo campaign (Linked below)[https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/get-the-airo-life-smartphone-be-free-phone/x/22495851?utm\_medium=referral&utm\_source=e.fnd.to#/](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/get-the-airo-life-smartphone-be-free-phone/x/22495851?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=e.fnd.to#/)Here's a link to the Facebook post:[https://www.facebook.com/AIROLIFE1/photos/a.381998862246033/764158630696719/?type=3&theater](https://www.facebook.com/AIROLIFE1/photos/a.381998862246033/764158630696719/?type=3&theater)Anything you can do to help with this campaign would be amazing – it helps people, families save money and we’re helping the environment in a time of Crisis.

Are the ads always always there? What happens when your watching YouTube or Netflix? This concept of always seeing advertising reminds me of the Black Mirror episode Fifteen Million Merits... thoughts?#really interesting that the previous business owned and operated by Airo.Life’s CEO was unsuccessful... If you Google the guy, he had another confused mess of a company called Holeshot1. Honestly took me a minute to figure out what they were selling as it appears to have been two different businesses run under the same name and branding. Holeshot1.com states that it was an “Action Sports Tech Products” company. Holeshot1 tried unsuccessfully to launch a line of headphones that never made it past the pre-order stage... Holeshot1 Media apparently focussed on Social Media Management and Content Production, so creating multimedia content for social media/websites and managing page posts. Other than a couple of plugs for Airo.Life, social media for both Holeshot1.com and Holeshot1 Media have not been updated in over a year and Google lists the company as “Permanently Closed”. I assume that Holeshot1 was not profitable enough to continue or sell the business, nor able to self-sustainably function after its owner focused his attention elsewhere. I don’t think I’d have much faith in someone with a failed tech/advertising business to successfully run a telecom/tech/advertising company on a much larger scale....#> We will be planting 100 trees per share, 20 trees per like  Do you know how much that costs?  In western countries planting a tree costs $75  Even in a developing country where planting a seedling (not a tree, a seedling) could be $0.50, you mean that you will pay $10 for each like and $50 for each share????#THIS IS A FUCKING [SCAM](https://old.reddit.com/r/shittykickstarters/comments/dfkb9b/airolife_get_a_free_phone_with_unlimited_free/) !

Could I use regression with party ID and student class as IVs and see how predictive they are? Or would an ANOVA be best so that I could compare the two ideologies at different student levels (though the data are not longitudinal)?;"Sounds like a party by class interaction is something to consider, the rest of the model could vary widely.

Elliot misses his dad. Angela misses her mom.The only way that happens is time travel, because.. dead in the 80’s. But Sam has already said that time travel isn’t an option one can introduce at this stage.A simulation of the universe is what? Aside from a few billion years of history, the bulk of what we deal with from the day to day is what we acknowledge. We’re all in a SIM, and the illusion is known to be complete because we all agree on lots of things we accept as reality: E-Corp is an entity, money has value, WR’s hubby died in the 80’s, etc.If the particle accelerator we saw is capable of sufficiently advancing quantum computing to the point that WR can leverage the masses of data we’ve surrendered effectively enough, I believe she could reprogram all the sims in the system (that’s us) to believe that it is the day before WR’s hubby died.Since our collective belief about the state of the universe at any point in time during the simulation would be continuously monitored by the software controlling it, if we all suddenly believed it was 1982, the simulation will be forced to restore any and all entities necessary for the world to proceed forward from that moment in time without us perceiving the absence of those items.Anything missing would be perceived by the sims as an anomaly- so the software will restore those missing pieces... including WR’s husband, and Angela’s mom, and Elliot’s dad.In short, cause a Kernel Panic.;I’ll add that when Angela is in the room with WR, WR asks her if she thinks that if one believes in something enough, it can become true.#did you see White rose in front of the quantum calculations in the last episode?

More commonly, clients with an existing data warehouse vendor will start pushing this kind of logic to marginalize Big Data vendors and protect their relationship with a client - ignoring many of the potential gains from looking at alternatives.#Big Data is simply data that is too large to fit on a single host/machine/node/device.  Small data is data that can fit on a single device and so can be processed ""locally"".  Big Data requires some sort of scale-out approach, where it sits on multiple devices, and so the processing must be done on multiple devices.   When comparing size of Big vs Small, that is what most are referring to.   This does not say anything about schema management.  Some scale-out engines fit a ""schema on write"" paradigm (e.g. Cassandra). Some engines take a ""schema on read"" approach (e.g. Hadoop).   Big data does require different tools for analysis.  With small data, we can often use the wundertool: Excel. But for Big Data we need something like MapReduce, or better: Spark.#It's as different as black males and Asian males"
econmonitor;dfivit;1570635902.0;/r/econmonitor/comments/dfivit/datadependent_monetary_policy_in_an_evolving/;Data-Dependent Monetary Policy in an Evolving Economy;[Chair Jerome H. Powell, 61st Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics, Denver, Colorado](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm)* 100 years ago, some of the first Fed policymakers recognized the need for more timely information on the rapidly evolving state of industry and decided to create and publish production indexes for the United States. Today I will pay tribute to the 100 years of dedicated—and often behind the scenes—work of those tracking change in the industrial landscape.* I will then turn to three challenges our dynamic economy is posing for policy at present: First, what would the consequences of a sharp rise in the price of oil be for the U.S. economy? This question, which never seems far from relevance, is again drawing our attention after recent events in the Persian Gulf. While the question is familiar, technological advances in the energy sector are rapidly changing our assessment of the answer.* Second, with terabytes of data increasingly competing with truckloads of goods in economic importance, what are the best ways to measure output and productivity? Put more provocatively, might the recent productivity slowdown be an artifact of antiquated measurement?* Third, how tight is the labor market? Given our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, this question is at the very core of our work. But answering it in real time in a dynamic economy as jobs are gained in one area but lost in others is remarkably challenging. In August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announced that job gains over the year through March were likely a half-million lower than previously reported. I will discuss how we are using big data to improve our grasp of the job market in the face of such revisions.;>  we closely monitor developments in oil markets because disruptions in these markets have played a role in several U.S. recessions and in the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s. Traditionally, we assessed that a sharp rise in the price of oil would have a strong negative effect on consumers and businesses and, hence, on the U.S. economy. Today a higher oil price would still cause dislocations and hardship for many, but with exports and imports nearly balanced, the higher price paid by consumers is roughly offset by higher earnings of workers and firms in the U.S. oil industry. Moreover, because it is now easier to ramp up oil production, a sustained price rise can quickly boost output, providing a shock absorber in the face of supply disruptions. Thus, setting aside the effects of geopolitical uncertainty that may accompany higher oil prices, we now judge that a price spike would likely have nearly offsetting effects on U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).#> Where others saw capacity constraints and incipient inflation, Greenspan saw a productivity boom that would leave room for very low unemployment without inflation pressures. In light of the uncertainty it faced, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judged that the appropriate risk‑management approach called for refraining from interest rate increases unless and until there were clearer signs of rising inflation. Under this policy, unemployment fell near record lows without rising inflation, and later revisions to GDP measurement showed appreciably faster productivity growth#> Productivity is again presenting a puzzle. Official statistics currently show productivity growth slowing significantly in recent years, with the growth in output per hour worked falling from more than 3 percent a year from 1995 to 2003 to less than half that pace since then.9 Analysts are actively debating three alternative explanations for this apparent slowdown: First, the slowdown may be real and may persist indefinitely as productivity growth returns to more‑normal levels after a brief golden age.10 Second, the slowdown may instead be a pause of the sort that often accompanies fundamental technological change, so that productivity gains from recent technology advances will appear over time as society adjusts.11 Third, the slowdown may be overstated, perhaps greatly, because of measurement issues akin to those at work in the 1990s.12 At this point, we cannot know which of these views may gain widespread acceptance, and monetary policy will play no significant role in how this puzzle is resolved. As in the late 1990s, however, we are carefully assessing the implications of possibly mismeasured productivity gains. Moreover, productivity growth seems to have moved up over the past year after a long period at very low levels  we do not know whether that welcome trend will be sustained.

And the fact that they announce it first on Stadia makes me wonder if we could get an EA on Stadia in November.Stadia looks like a cool platform to do EA on. Just update the source image at the Google data-center and everyone is updated (no downloads). Larian GDC talks have a huge chunk of big data analytics of player behavior. What better way to have this control then in a streaming environment. Player reports a bug and the can just ""snapshot"" the session to see what is going on.&#x200B So is an November EA just around the corner?";Nope.   Do not get your hopes up. This game will be in development for a long time. If we are lucky we get it late in 2020, I predict though late summer of 2021.#Considering BG3 has only RECENTLY been given a teaser, and that’s it... I could see BG3 being a release title for the new consoles (Holiday 2020). So for platforms like PC/Stadia we might see an early access/beta type deal around summer 2020.  But that would almost certainly be a true beta for bug testing. And even then, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s later than that.   Be cautiously optimistic, but also don’t expect anything.#Approximately 0%. Larian has seemingly only ever done early access to fund their games, not because they like releasing them unfinished. With the success of D:OS2, they now have enough money to comfortably develop games, hence why Baldur's Gate isn't going to have a Kickstarter, unlike the past 3 Larian games.

She's done some years of solid ML and Big Data research in more academically focused topics (and maybe a couple of internships, I can't remember) where she led research teams.I work at a Big N tech company with a lot of Research/Applied Scientist and PhD requiring roles and we've been talking a little bit about my experiences (I do not have a PhD). She is thinking about going in to the industry rather than academia, and I can only offer so much perspective on the matter. So, I have a few questions:1. What is your perspective on industry vs academia for new PhDs (preferably if you have a PhD and have gone through this)?2. What companies and areas would you say are best (specific companies, but general category can help too) based on her background? This is taking in to account CoL and interestingness and opportunities in areas to live (currently she's on the East Coast but open to moving to most places) and in terms of companies, workload and culture for researchers, compensation for someone of her situation, career path or advancement opportunities, what kind of work is done (how interesting/cutting edge she could work on after getting hired), and any other metrics that are relevant?Thank you, sorry for the ambiguity of some parts, it's just a big decision.;"If you're about to finish your PhD, you likely have a somewhat well-formed idea of where you want to end up. As part of a PhD, you've presented non-trivial original research at conferences, which are attended by university faculty (i.e., hiring committees) and industry researchers (i.e., also hiring committees). Has she not spoken with these folks at conferences?  I've been a researcher in both industry and academia. The trade-off I see between the two is that industry is generally more financially lucrative and less stressful, but academic research can be more impactful (i.e., you're more free to reach out to external people like journalists and regulators) and you're better integrated into your research community there. Note that there is a fair bit of overlap between the two  researchers in both realms all got their start in doctoral programs at universities, and people tend to keep connections with their old advisors and groups.#PhD here. Working in industry.  > What is your perspective on industry vs academia for new PhDs (preferably if you have a PhD and have gone through this)  It doesn't matter. I have very strong opinions about which was better for me, but those opinions do not translate to anybody else. I know people who are much happier in academia and I know people who are much happier in industry. After 5+ years in grad school, somebody should know whether they'd be happy in academia and have a sense for their prospects in getting a tenure track position.   > What companies and areas would you say are best (specific companies, but general category can help too) based on her background?   The answer here is similar. This is not something that somebody can answer without knowing this person. ML research opens up doors for the major tech companies as well as startups and probably also some of the few remaining industrial labs. All of these options have pros and cons that mean different things to different people.  I am a little worried about your mention of ""top grades"" here, since grades in grad school are about as close to meaningless as something can possibly be. Research output is what matters. Is she published in top venues? Does she have a lot of citations? That's what matters.#Your PhD advisor should be coaching and guiding you.  Your thesis project should also be giving you direction as to what to do and where to do it.  You should have chosen your thesis project based on what you ultimately wanted to do.  PhD is not an automatic ticket to a high paying job.#PhD adviser should be guiding you and the project should also be giving you direction as to what to do and  to finish your PhD, you likely have a somewhat well formed idea of where you want to end up As part of a PhD.#Top 50 -> N.B.C (Nobody Care)."

I've researched a mountain of information on both universities. However, It's a little bit hard for me to find suitable materials for this joint degree since my English may not good enough. :(The main reason I choose to study in Amsterdam because of its history, big city, and motivated students coming from all over the world.I am so lucky since I was admitted to the Master of Computer Science joint-degree ( Majoring in Big Data Engineering) with UvA/VU, and I have some question need to be answered. I hope that this website has students who study in this program and kindly give me some practical information.1. Is it true that, for this program, most of the time I will study at VU Amsterdam?2. I have heard that joint-degree will be registered with both universities, so is it true that I will have two student cards that can help me to use both universities' facilities?3. what is the typical expense for international students when studying in Amsterdam? except for tuition fees.4. As I want to focus on the research and pursue a Ph.D. in the future, is there any opportunity for a master's student doing some research work with the professor while studying？5. Can this degree be verified double degree in China or just a single degree be awarded by VU Amsterdam? If there are Chinese students who can answer this question.6. Anything else I should know? :)Thanks!I hope you guys having a nice day!;Others are better suited to answer the other questions, but about typical expenses:  * Rent could be as low as ~€400 for a studio apartment (after subsidies) or as high as ~€650 for a shitty room in a shitty house you share with 7 other people depending on how lucky you get. * Utilities + internet totals to ~€90. * Health insurance is ~€80 on the cheap end with low coverage. * One person can do their groceries for about €110 if you’re reasonably frugal. Lidl is cheap, Jumbo, Albert Heijn and Plus are middle of the road. * You may want a bike to get around. Don’t rent it. Get one second-hand for €100 or less from marktplaats.nl#1. Correct 2. Yes 3. Rent, it is almost impossible to find a room in amsterdam. 4. Yes 5. It is a single degree where different parts are teached by each university. It is not two programs. 6. Housing is almost impossible.

But working in a company: there's something about taking something I love, a hobby, a passion, and seeing it corrupted by company people that just want to use it for money and only care about low-ball budgets and deadlines. Working in software development has ended up being completely different to what it was like studying it. The people are different. Instead of being around bright-eyed gee-whiz nerds, I'm surrounded by (snake oil) salesmen and managerial types that love to twist the words said by technical folk. I also consider my work unethical and I'm disgusted with myself for what I do. Everything is REST APIs these days. And I'm working on web application systems that use REST APIs to on-sell your browsing interactions, so that everywhere you go you can be stalked by big data and machine learning-generated ads of what you just viewed.I hate my life now, and I can't understand how it turned out this way.What can I do? I can't just go back to university and choose another career. I have adult responsibilities with adult-sized bills now. I seem to be locked in to a life that isn't mine and I don't want. That's what I got from attending college.;You have a Master's in Computer Science, even if you specialized in software development or whatnot you could still absolutely get a different job in a different job area. You should start applying to other jobs that sound good to you.#Get a job with an organization whose mission you care about.#Find a different job?#>	What can I do?

I've done just that, have a full profile up but still nothing.It's especially frustrating as I'm interested in politics and I'm in a target state for YouGov's surveys yet they still never hit me.

bioinformatics;djadbe;1571336394.0;/r/bioinformatics/comments/djadbe/advice_on_what_i_should_do_next/;Advice on what I should do next?;I graduated last year with a bachelor's in biochemistry and am now working as a research associate for a metabolomics lab. I am really enjoying the experience I am getting. We have a variety of mass spectrometry instruments (LCMS, GCMS, ICPMS, and DART) and access to other instruments such as REIMS. They are starting to train me on all of these instruments and I am really excited. Im finding out that I'm liking the bigger picture when it comes to science  the tools we use, method development, and big data.  I am going to pursue a masters in biological data analysis but am still on the fence about a getting a phd.  If I did, I think I would do bioinformatics.  I am finding that I really like metabolomics, genomics and systems biology.  I have a couple of questions. I already have plenty of debt and would like to continue working as much as possible to pay it off as soon as possible.  Is it possible to work while pursuing a phd, and if so how strenuous is it? Are there jobs out there that pay for higher education like a phd? Also, given my experience and interests that I have already stated, do you think there are better opportunities available to me? I'm currently learning R for statistical analysis but any other advice on what sort of skills I should acquire to help me out in my career would be great.;Of course PhD has the potential to increase your earnings potential greatly. A PhD with a bioinformatics focus will absolutely make you more competitive in both academia and industry.   Most PhD programs explicitly forbid you from working while in school - for good reason because you really shouldn’t have time for a second job. PhD takes your entire focus and energy. I know some people have tutored or did housesitting on the side for some extra cash, but that’s probably about it.   You can always try applying to jobs with your current background and experience. With mass spec experience you might get into a nice position in industry.   You shouldn’t pursue a PhD solely for career progression - a high amount of passion and dedication are also required to get through it.

Last month, I attended a workshop on big data and data analytics. While being really informative, it did not quite tell a lot about the necessary prerequisites to start with, or as to what avenues one could/should go for per their interests. Neither did I expect it to, one can only cram so much info into a small workshop. Nevertheless, their workshop has been annoyingly bugging me in the back of my mind ever since.And hence, I come here, looking for a few tips or guidelines as to how to jump ships into the world of data. Stuff I might want to go through. Cheers;I’d start with learning SQL. Download the adventure works database and the free version of Microsoft sql server on your computer. I took this super cheap course on Udemy to study some advanced SQL writing.   https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-sql-from-a-to-z/learn/lecture/6454508?start=0#content  After SQL, use Python.  I’d recommend reading Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes  https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036  The learning curve for Python is much harder then SQL  however this is what sets you apart from the men and the boys (or the girls and the ladies) in moving and dealing with ugly data (Pandas, matplotlib, ODBC, etc.). After you get this down, start doing some research about how to use Python and SQL together (connecting to a database, writing queries and executing with Python, creating them into data frames, visualizing then for insightful information).  Just to clarify, and I’m sure this may have been covered in your seminar. There are two distinct differences between working in data and then handling big data. You can get really far just using SQL but it all kinda matters how deep you want to train yourself. Piece of advice, learn one programming language/skill at a time, it does not help to juggle multiple languages to achieve writing hello world 50 times.#I'm not entirely sure what a power eng is or what your education is.   I'd recommend getting started on coding. Python would probably be the easiest entry point, and enough to take you far.  Do a short online course on Python/ML  Get familiar with basic statistical and probabilistic concepts.  Play around with datasets. Kaggle.com is a very nice place with many datasets.

We've added tons of stop words and partitioned all the data to the point that it works well, but not very quickly.   We've conferred with Oracle's top Oracle Text resources and just aren't getting the response times in the database we're looking for with text searches (if we don't use text, we get sub-second responses, but text queries take 20+ seconds to respond across the breadth of the data).   When we ingest the text into Elastic we get great response and allows us a few more options for creative searches, but we don't want to completely re-write our app for Elastic.Has anyone successfully merged the two with GG and can point to real-world examples?   All I can seem to find is how to set up GG for Elastic, but not any actual examples.Just to be clear: I'm looking for the ability to run a SELECT statement that can pull together the result from an Oracle table and an Elastic Index.Thanks in advance;Sounds like Stockholm Syndrome to me.

After doing a lot of research and pondering, I set my sights to try and become a Data Scientist. Of all programs I have looked at, I am most interested in SFU's MSc in Big Data. I saw on LinkedIn earlier, that a whoping 1600 people had applied for the 2019 academic year. 1600!!! And only 100 of them were admitted. Is it really that competitive? What are my chances of getting in. I have a good GPA but little relevant work experience and no papers/research. Can anyone who got an admit message me with their stats? I'm really feeling a bit defeated after finding out how many people applied in the last intake :(;Idk about SFU. But at a top german school their data science program takes about that manly applications and only takes in 20 a year.     Their stats were 1.0 to 2.0. 1.0  is basically a perfect GPA but 2.0 is like a B/ B+ student. They lower the grade requirement if you demonstrate substantial or relevant work experience and international experience such as studying abroad,         Opinion: I hear good things about the Big Data program in terms of career outcomes. Personally, I'd choose Germany. I'd have worse career prospects if I try to work in grmany. At SFU, they might be able to hook me up with a good coop,      However, I'd still choose germany for the better life style and significantly cheaper tuition even for international non-german speaking students.
UKPersonalFinance;divcr7;1571258144.0;/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/divcr7/postgrad_student_trying_to_plan_his_future/;Post-Grad Student trying to plan his future [Advice/Feedback];"Long post incoming, scroll to the bottom for a TL:DR.Edit: Sorry for telling my life story, I think it shows where I'm coming from and explains a bit better what my goal is.I just moved to the UK a couple weeks ago, from mainland Europe, for my post-grad studies in Big Data Analytics. I started reading a bunch of those self-help books a while ago because I didn't really know what my goals in life were. After a while I came to the conclusion that my dream would be a ""small"" farm/range/estate, pretty much a place to live, big enough for an extended family, surrounded by nature with a handful of animals.Here's a bit of background story why that would be my dream and what I'm exactly thinking about:I grew up at an ancient horse stable, there was an old castle ruin and the stables of this castle from hundreds of years ago were kept in tact by the owners. My parents rented the whole thing and used it to offer horse back riding lessons. As a kid I could just explore the area, play in the forest and so on. The building we lived in was big enough for our family of 4 and one or two friends / extended family members who stayed with us every now and then. Fast forward 15 years, the owner dies, the heirs can't decide who gets everything, so they sell it. The new owner kicks us out because he wants to use it as a restaurant and farm land and we found a new stable to rent.Now whenever I think about my childhood, I remember how I never can visit this place again, because the whole area got a makeover and pretty much nothing is how it was. This brings me to my goal, to buy something similar. To have a place for the next generation of the family to grow up at and for the family to come together and stay for generations to come.&#x200B I know that something like this is quite expensive and even though I'll finish my degree next year and I can look forward to a good paying job, I can't see how I would be able to achieve something like this.Right now I am completely free of any debt and with my savings and scholarship I'll be fine until I graduate. I'm a pretty frugal person when it comes to spending money. I don't really eat out, smoke or drink excessively and I'm fine living in a one room flat. In general, my expenses are pretty low and I don't mind keeping it that way.I read through a couple pages of the wiki, looked at the flowchart and started reading the books from the recommended reading list. I think I will just try to follow the flowchart once I start working, but are there any suggestions what I could do while I'm still studying. Anything I should look into or anything I can do in that one year before I start working full time?&#x200B TL:DRI'll finish my post-grad degree in a year and want to buy a nice house with a good amount of land around it. I don't have any debt, read through the wiki and working my way through the recommended readings. What can I do in my last year of Uni to set a good foundation for my goal?Is there anything else I could do, other than just investing my money in funds? General advice about how to get there would be great too, I'm just getting into the whole money management thing.";You will not go far wrong with following the sidebar, the flowchart and the lump sum guide.  The difficult part is identifying the goal - but if you have that, the financial elements are pretty mechanical.#Your childhood sounds amazing! IMO, finish school, start working, advance in your career, travel (see the world!) then assess if this is still what you want to do in your life. You may decide in a few years that you want to stay in a city, or that you want to move to a different country and just focus on your career.  While it is good to have some long term goals, give yourself a chance to discover what's out there beyond what you experienced as a child.

As per him, he gave us this project in order for us to kick-in using PySpark and start finding ways of our own to wrap the project. I love this approach of him to force us to self-learn but this project counts for bonus points. Any guidance on how to approach the problem will be highly appreciable :This .txt file is the ad journey of a user & it  contains : >id: string, timestamp: string, type: string, visitorId: string, pageUrl: stringEach line of the file represents an ad event and each user has one unique id called VisitorId.I am required to find next NextPageUrl that visitors visited per event on their event journey. >For Instance: given two sequential in time events e001 and e002 from a visitor v001, the output event o1 should contain the id, timestamp, type, visitorId, & pageUrl from e001 but the nextPageUrl will be the pageUrl from e002My thinking :It is been a month and I am reading about Hadoop on and off but I am very well aware of the fact that I am far away from even getting decent in Hadoop world. Anyway, I think I should first count the distinct VisitorId and then using VisitorID as Key, I can reduce the values of the pageUrl . Do not sound tough but somehow my instincts say that it cannot be this easy. So any input will be highly appreciable and I am looking forward to constructive criticism as well so that I can correct the mistakes and learn more. Thanks.;[deleted]

The goal is to collect everything: every activity, every piece of information, every picture, every occurrence, everything. Big data fully realized.Once everything is collected, that data can be analyzed, and patterns of behavior can be established. Then a super computer with AI can monitor everything. Any deviations from the norm can be immediately exposed and analyzed.For example, everyday, you leave your house at 7 am to go to work at a specific location. But today you didn't. The AI will attempt to explain the deviation. It will check your company's records. Was he fired yesterday? Is that why he didn't go to work today? Nope, he wasn't fired. Check the smart toilet. Oh, he threw up this morning. He's sick. Deviation explained. Oh, and look at that, he called his boss this morning at 8 am to tell him he's sick. And company records have been updated as of 8:37 am. No human needs to be informed of this deviation.Or... A cell tower is reporting that there's a new cell phone in this neighborhood that's never been here before. Whose phone is it? Did a resident get a new phone number? Check the registration records of the phone. It's a prepaid burner, purchased with...cash! Alert a human analyst! (A human gets an email alert.) The computer continues to monitor the intruder. Where is the intruder going? It's going to 123 Panopticon Lane. Accessing camera feeds. Capturing real time video of the intruder ringing the doorbell. Oh, the homeowner let them in. Let's be sure this is a safe situation by listening in on their conversation. Are they talking about overthrowing the government? Are they talking in code? Are they talking about politics? Religion? Are they having an affair? The computer will analyze the conversation and determine the topic and whether or not there's any reason for concern.This is the future. Don't suppose that you can stop it.;

I haven't considered PC building for about 12 years. things have changed. graphics cards used to have scantily clad silk screened images of females on them... now i don't know what graphics cards get you the hawt girlz (okay I'm not THAT far out of it... let's get into it)&#x200B I'm thinking of starting a new build. I'm PRETTY sure I want to use an AM4 socket. I intend on hardwiring the PC so wifi onboard is not important to me, and I'd rather save a buck with that if possible. eventually I'll water cool it, and I like the look of the super big cases with glass so a full-sized board is fine (but money and upgradability is more important than size, I just figure with mini-atx you're paying to have finer parts with less upgradability) I intend on getting a solid MOBO and power supply, and cheaping out on other components until I can spring for high performance cpu, gpu, probably a USB pci? is that a thing? Also, I know sound cards kinda fell out of popularity what sorts of sound solution is common if I were to try to also use this for home theatre? I saw some mobos push 5.1 now (I assume I have to send it through an amp.) what about 7.1? I may be getting greedy here, and really probably won't use this, so push that to the way back of your mind... but running an HDMI to another room so I can tap my computer into a big TV someday with a whole surround system sounds really neat (and I'm not sure if there's much reason beyond being neat)My intended use for this PC is gaming. I really want to do elite dangerous with VR, joystick&throttle, voice command, and 1-3 cameras (1 for streaming, the other two or maybe 3 essentially as security/nany cams) so having a lot of USB is important, and I know sometimes usb cameras get upset if they share a USB header with each other so I think my solution is just to have LOADS of usb... thoughts?there's 1 other game that I'm really interested in playing which is (don't laugh too hard) Morrowind. this game was released in 2002, and doesn't have multi core support. which is why I'm asking this question: Will 4 cores game? I know someday I want to get that sexy 8 core 3.9ghz base ryzen (maybe even 12 years down the line), but that pricepoint is a bit high for me right now. I see... [**AMD A12-9800 Bristol Ridge Quad-Core 3.8 GHz Socket AM4 65W** ](https://www.newegg.com/amd-a12-7th-gen-a12-9800/p/N82E16819113449) used for $100. how well could I get away with that for a while? Morrowind would be happy with that for sure, how badly will it bottleneck my vr stuff? I feel like such fast 4 cores is probably fine as long as I have a powerful enough graphics card right? it's my impression that more cores is useful for people who use their pc to work - big data simulations for physics labs, and hard core graphics artists. While faster cores is really where it's at for gaming. am I way off here?as for graphics, for now I'm thinking 980 or 1080 that I probably also pick up used. someday the dream is of course a 2080, and speaking of that I know dual video cards is a thing. do they have to be 2 of the same video card? could I run a 1080 and a 2080 together for any sort of performance boost? 1080ti still feels like pretty big money to me, what's a solid card that would support my elite dangerous dreams comfortably? the point is to have something that works well, not ""just barely"" for now until I can upgrade to something that'll be relevant for many many years. upgrade time: within a year.Given that it's gaming I'm interested in I'm thinking I'll skip huge ram numbers, 4x4gb sticks seems fine at 3700 hz? I really am out of my element here. buffered? unbuffered? ECC? I've got 2 8gb sticks from my old desktop that I THINK will work (old dell inspiron running an i7 i think...) until I can get the \*choice\* memories with RGB for that RGB performance boost we all know is a thing.&#x200B and now we come to the end I think (unless I forgot something). the ultimate question is this: what motherboard? of course I want input and corrections to all my incorrect assumtions, but I'll be buying this piece-by-piece so I'm not in a hurry for all the things I might buy used. I'm in a place to buy a mobo and a power supply so that's where I'll start. I'm pretty sure corsair 850 gold+ is where I'm going (I may also be an idiot) but I have no idea where to start on the mobo. any other thoughts are appreciated! thank you for reading my ramblings!";You can get a first gen ryzen 1600 and get 6core and 12threads#This sub is usually for parts lists that we can go over with suggestions to get more performance out of. You might have more luck at r/buildapcforme just tell that sub what you want to do with a budget you are willing to spend.   I would suggest going to pcpartpicker.com to see what the budget looks like. A ryzen build is generally more cost efficient for the performance you want.#Do not buy that CPU under any circumstances. I used an a10-5800k and it was horrible. That APU, while on the am4 socket isnt ryzen based which means its around 60% slower in single core performance.

devops;dglpn9;1570829869.0;/r/devops/comments/dglpn9/netdata_the_opensource_realtime_performance_and/;Netdata, the open-source real-time performance and health monitoring, released v1.18!;"Hi all, Release v1.18.0 contains 5 new collectors, 19 bug fixes, 28 improvements, and 20 documentation updates.**At a glance** The **database engine** is now the default method of storing metrics in Netdata. You immediately get more efficient and configurable long-term metrics storage without any work on your part. By saving recent metrics in RAM and ""spilling"" historical metrics to disk for long-term storage, the database engine is laying the foundation for many more improvements to distributed metrics.We even have a [tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/longer-metrics-storage/) on switching to the database engine and getting the most from it. Or, just read up on [how performant](https://docs.netdata.cloud/database/engine/#evaluation) the database engine really is.Both our **python.d** and **go.d** plugins now have more **intelligent auto-detection** by periodically dump a list of active modules to disk. When Netdata starts, such as after a reboot, the plugins use this list of known services to re-establish metrics collection much more reliably. No more worrying if the service or application you need to monitor starts up minutes after Netdata.Two of our new collectors will help those with Hadoop big data infrastructures. The **HDFS and Zookeeper collection modules** come with essential alarms requested by our community and Netdata's auto-detection capabilities to keep the required configuration to an absolute minimum. Read up on the process via our [HDFS and Zookeeper tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/monitor-hadoop-cluster/).Speaking of new collectors—we also added the ability to collect metrics from SLAB cache, Gearman, and vCenter Server Appliances.Before v1.18, if you wanted to create alarms for each dimension in a single chart, you need to write separate entities for each dimension—not very efficient or user-friendly. New **dimension templates** fix that hassle. Now, a single entity can automatically generate alarms for any number of dimensions in a chart, even those you weren't aware of! Our [tutorial on dimension templates](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/dimension-templates/) has all the details.v1.18 brings support for installing Netdata on offline or air-gapped systems. To help users comply with strict security policies, our installation scripts can now install Netdata using previously-downloaded tarball and checksums instead of downloading them at runtime. We have guides for installing offline via **kickstart.sh** or **kickstart-static64.sh** in our [installation documentation](https://docs.netdata.cloud/packaging/installer/#offline-installations) . We're excited to bring real-time monitoring to once-inaccessible systems!**Improvements**- **Database Engine**    - Make dbengine the default memory mode    - Increase dbengine default cache size     - Reduce overhead during write IO     - Detect deadlock in dbengine page cache     - Remove hard cap from page cache size to eliminate deadlocks- **New Collectors**    - [SLAB cache mechanism](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/slabinfo.plugin/)    - [Gearman worker statistics](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/python.d.plugin/gearman/)    - [vCenter Server Appliance](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/vcsa/)    - [Zookeeper servers](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/zookeeper/)    - [Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) nodes](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/hdfs/)- **Collector Improvements**    - rabbitmq: Add vhosts message metrics from /api/vhosts     - elasticsearch: collect metrics from _cat/indices    - mysql: collect galera cluster metrics     - Allow configuration of the python.d launch command from netdata.conf     - [x509check](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/x509check): smtp cert check support    - [dnsmasq_dhcp](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/dnsmasq_dhcp) : respect conf-dir,conf-file,dhcp-host options     - plugin: respect previously running jobs after plugin restart    - [httpcheck](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/httpcheck) : add current state duration chart     - [springboot2](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/springboot2): fix context- **Health**    - Enable alarm templates for chart dimensions     - Center the chart on the proper chart and time whenever an alarm link is clicked - **Installation/Packages**    - netdata/installer: Add support for offline installations using kickstart.sh or kickstart-static64.sh     - Allow netdata service installation, when docker runs systemd     - Make spec file more consistent with version dependencies    - Fix broken links on web files, for DEB     - Introduce separate CUPS package for DEB #6724 and RPM. Do not build CUPS plugin subpackage on CentOS 6 and CentOS 7     - Various Improvements in the package release CI/CD flow     - Remove RHEL7 - i386 binary distribution, until bug #6849 is resolved     - Bring on board two scripts that build libuv and judy from source ---[Check the release log at github](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/releases/tag/v1.18.0).If you are new to netdata, [check a few live demos at its home page](https://my-netdata.io/) and the [project home at github](https://github.com/netdata/netdata).Netdata is FOSS (Free Open Source Software), released under GPLv3+.> Enjoy real-time performance and health monitoring!```";

By using the stock cooler(which is good enough), a relatively small SSD, functional but not fantastic power supply, and cheap case, room can be made for an 8-core CPU, 16gb of ram, and a 1 tb hard drive.  A powerful CPU is important in content creation, and the 2700X is strong at this price point. The motherboard will work for this build, its pretty boring other than that. You mentioned leaving a lot of windows up, and doing content creation work, both of which need ram, hence the 16gb kit(note the 16gb kit instead a 16 gb stick, it theoretically doubles memory bandwidth). The storage solution could be better by swapping the sata ssd for a nvme ssd. The pairing of fast ssd and a slower but cost effective hard drive is a good cost saving solution for decent amounts of storage, but gets a tad annoying dragging files back and forth.  &#x200B   The 580 video card is 31% better on the userbench website, and costs about the same as a 1650, and at this price point value matters. The case and power supply are cheap and will work, but as mentioned earlier, 8 core cpu.  I don't know much about headphones, so you might want to get better advice. The build has $50 left for any webcam you see fit. This list also includes dual monitors, but you might need a display port to HDMI adapter, which you can find on amazon for pretty cheap.  &#x200B   Good luck!  \[PCPartPicker Part List\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/list/wwy9Wb](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/wwy9Wb))  &#x200B   Type|Item|Price  \*\*CPU\*\* | \[AMD Ryzen 7 2700X 3.7 GHz 8-Core Processor\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/bddxFT/amd-ryzen-7-2700x-37ghz-8-core-processor-yd270xbgafbox](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/bddxFT/amd-ryzen-7-2700x-37ghz-8-core-processor-yd270xbgafbox)) | $194.89 @ OutletPC  \*\*Motherboard\*\* | \[MSI B450 Gaming Plus ATX AM4 Motherboard\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/3YhKHx/msi-b450-gaming-plus-atx-am4-motherboard-b450-gaming-plus](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/3YhKHx/msi-b450-gaming-plus-atx-am4-motherboard-b450-gaming-plus)) | $84.89 @ OutletPC  \*\*Memory\*\* | \[Patriot Viper 4 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 Memory\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/h8dxFT/patriot-viper-4-16gb-2-x-8gb-ddr4-3200-memory-pv416g320c6k](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/h8dxFT/patriot-viper-4-16gb-2-x-8gb-ddr4-3200-memory-pv416g320c6k)) | $64.98 @ Amazon  \*\*Storage\*\* | \[Kingston Q500 240 GB 2.5"" Solid State Drive\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/g8DJ7P/kingston-q500-240-gb-25-solid-state-drive-sq500s37240g](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/g8DJ7P/kingston-q500-240-gb-25-solid-state-drive-sq500s37240g)) | $29.99 @ Amazon  \*\*Storage\*\* | \[Hitachi Ultrastar 1 TB 3.5"" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/wNV48d/hitachi-internal-hard-drive-hua721010kla330](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/wNV48d/hitachi-internal-hard-drive-hua721010kla330)) | $29.99 @ Amazon  \*\*Video Card\*\* | \[MSI Radeon RX 580 8 GB ARMOR OC Video Card\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/TTfmP6/msi-radeon-rx-580-8gb-armor-oc-video-card-rx-580-armor-8g-oc](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/TTfmP6/msi-radeon-rx-580-8gb-armor-oc-video-card-rx-580-armor-8g-oc)) | $164.99 @ Newegg  \*\*Case\*\* | \[DIYPC Alnitak-BK ATX Mid Tower Case\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/86RFf7/diypc-case-alnitakbk](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/86RFf7/diypc-case-alnitakbk)) | $39.96 @ Newegg  \*\*Power Supply\*\* | \[Rosewill 500 W 80+ Bronze Certified Semi-modular ATX Power Supply\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/zVnG3C/rosewill-power-supply-glacier500m](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/zVnG3C/rosewill-power-supply-glacier500m)) | $44.99 @ Amazon  \*\*Operating System\*\* | \[Microsoft Windows 10 Home OEM 64-bit\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/wtgPxr/microsoft-os-kw900140](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/wtgPxr/microsoft-os-kw900140)) | $99.89 @ OutletPC  \*\*Monitor\*\* | \[Acer R221Q bid 21.5"" 1920x1080 60 Hz Monitor\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JWM323/acer-r221q-bid-215-1920x1080-60hz-monitor-umwr1aa001](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JWM323/acer-r221q-bid-215-1920x1080-60hz-monitor-umwr1aa001)) | $79.98 @ Amazon  \*\*Monitor\*\* | \[Acer R221Q bid 21.5"" 1920x1080 60 Hz Monitor\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JWM323/acer-r221q-bid-215-1920x1080-60hz-monitor-umwr1aa001](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JWM323/acer-r221q-bid-215-1920x1080-60hz-monitor-umwr1aa001)) | $79.98 @ Amazon  \*\*Headphones\*\* | \[Thermaltake SHOCK  Headset\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/FxFXsY/thermaltake-headphones-htshk002ecbl](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/FxFXsY/thermaltake-headphones-htshk002ecbl)) | $39.48 @ Amazon  | \*Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts\* |  | Total (before mail-in rebates) | $994.01  | Mail-in rebates | -$40.00  | \*\*Total\*\* | \*\*$954.01\*\*  | Generated by \[PCPartPicker\]([https://pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com)) 2019-10-17 01:13 EDT-0400 |"

And how could such a guideline apply to a man who's 5'3 and 130 pounds and a 6'4 man who's 260 lbs.I'm a pretty good google user, but I spent a whole day on bing and google and couldn't find any data in the following categories which could be used in a simple model:**Category 1:** blood alcohol level VS liver disease or brain damage**Category 2:** adult males/females who drink X servings of alcohol per day/week/month VS liver disease diagnosis or brain damage diagnosis **Category 3:** data sets on statistical likelihood of non-alcoholic binge drinkers developing liver disease or brain damage where binge drinking is defined as in excess of a particular number of drinks over time or a particular blood alcohol level **Do you think there's an even slightly useful way to model specific drinking habits mirroring those of average heavy drinkers and determine risk?** And could we use statistics to argue a marginal decrease of a specific amount of alcohol would reduce risk (within a set interval of confidence) given a typical healthy person's sex, height, weight, and body-fat %?In general wouldn't it be nice to see public health guidelines about alcohol that use big data and could help people make informed choices about their drinking and risk? Don't you think a lot of people might marginally cut back on drinking, maybe one less night per week, or 3 less drinks per day, given some sophisticated models? I think the a lot of heavy drinkers would cut back moderately if they were told, ""Hey Ms. Jane Doe 1 less night per week, reduces your risk of liver disease by 33%."" or ""Howdy there mister 'Joe Sixpack' if you average 7 less drinks per week, and you reduce your chance of stroke by 25%""?What do you think?";

I work at a Fortune 100 non-tech company and I've seen two of my peers (officially SWE's) with the same level of experience land jobs at FAANG while I don't even get an interview.  But I **have** had recruiters reach out to me about Data Engineering positions at FAANG so...??  What's especially puzzling is that one of my peers was on my team and we essentially did the same kind of work involving AWS and Big Data, it's just that he was officially a ""Software Engineer"" and I am a ""Data Engineer"".I mean this question sincerely (not intending to be rude/sarcastic/a smartass):  Do recruiters and hiring managers actually know that Data Engineers are like a kind of Backend Software Engineer?  Or do they just toss the resume (especially if the candidate is not at a top company) because it doesn't say ""software"" anywhere and assume that Data Engineers can't code for industry?";"Just call yourself a software engineer#You could simply put that on your resume if it's the kind of work you're doing anyway.  \> Do recruiters and hiring managers actually know that Data Engineers are like a kind of Backend Software Engineer?

I'm sure some of them can't or don't do the same kind of coding.  It's not like there's 3rd party evaluation of job titles and responsibilities anywhere."

cscareerquestions;dfdrng;1570606944.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dfdrng/switching_future_career_paths_full_stack_big_data/;Switching future career paths: Full Stack <-> Big Data;"I recently have graduated with a bachelor's degree in CS (software engineering) and decided to get master's degree, also in CS with specialization in web application development. It's a two year programme and I'm on the 1st year, 1st semester. I'm about to start research work for my thesis and just talked to my thesis supervisor. When we discussed the scope of my thesis (basically a web app to do some financial analysis) she said I should really consider changing programmes and doing specialization in big data, where she also teaches. She said it would be a great project for what they are studying and fits their curriculum really well. The problem is I'm not very good at math, specifically ""continuous"" math, i.e. calculus. I do know and understand discrete math fairly well though. She said they did not study math but I guess at that point it's implied you know all math from your bachelor's programme. So I guess I have two questions:1. Should I consider switching career paths? 2. How much math do you have to use in your daily work as a big data engineer? \*\*  if I do decide to switch to big data I'd like to specialize in financial analysis since I have 2 years of education (dropped out) in this field and I did not have any problems with math over there.";Friend of mine is a big data engineer. His work is mostly ETL (Extract , transform , load) , work with different DBs and use stuff like hadoop and spark. I do not think there's much math/statistics involved.

Ubuntu;dgltvb;1570830440.0;/r/Ubuntu/comments/dgltvb/netdata_the_opensource_realtime_performance_and/;Netdata, the open-source real-time performance and health monitoring, released v1.18!;"Hi all, Release v1.18.0 contains 5 new collectors, 19 bug fixes, 28 improvements, and 20 documentation updates.**At a glance** The **database engine** is now the default method of storing metrics in Netdata. You immediately get more efficient and configurable long-term metrics storage without any work on your part. By saving recent metrics in RAM and ""spilling"" historical metrics to disk for long-term storage, the database engine is laying the foundation for many more improvements to distributed metrics.We even have a [tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/longer-metrics-storage/) on switching to the database engine and getting the most from it. Or, just read up on [how performant](https://docs.netdata.cloud/database/engine/#evaluation) the database engine really is.Both our **python.d** and **go.d** plugins now have more **intelligent auto-detection** by periodically dump a list of active modules to disk. When Netdata starts, such as after a reboot, the plugins use this list of known services to re-establish metrics collection much more reliably. No more worrying if the service or application you need to monitor starts up minutes after Netdata.Two of our new collectors will help those with Hadoop big data infrastructures. The **HDFS and Zookeeper collection modules** come with essential alarms requested by our community and Netdata's auto-detection capabilities to keep the required configuration to an absolute minimum. Read up on the process via our [HDFS and Zookeeper tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/monitor-hadoop-cluster/).Speaking of new collectors—we also added the ability to collect metrics from SLAB cache, Gearman, and vCenter Server Appliances.Before v1.18, if you wanted to create alarms for each dimension in a single chart, you need to write separate entities for each dimension—not very efficient or user-friendly. New **dimension templates** fix that hassle. Now, a single entity can automatically generate alarms for any number of dimensions in a chart, even those you weren't aware of! Our [tutorial on dimension templates](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/dimension-templates/) has all the details.v1.18 brings support for installing Netdata on offline or air-gapped systems. To help users comply with strict security policies, our installation scripts can now install Netdata using previously-downloaded tarball and checksums instead of downloading them at runtime. We have guides for installing offline via **kickstart.sh** or **kickstart-static64.sh** in our [installation documentation](https://docs.netdata.cloud/packaging/installer/#offline-installations) . We're excited to bring real-time monitoring to once-inaccessible systems!**Improvements**- **Database Engine**    - Make dbengine the default memory mode    - Increase dbengine default cache size     - Reduce overhead during write IO     - Detect deadlock in dbengine page cache     - Remove hard cap from page cache size to eliminate deadlocks- **New Collectors**    - [SLAB cache mechanism](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/slabinfo.plugin/)    - [Gearman worker statistics](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/python.d.plugin/gearman/)    - [vCenter Server Appliance](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/vcsa/)    - [Zookeeper servers](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/zookeeper/)    - [Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) nodes](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/hdfs/)- **Collector Improvements**    - rabbitmq: Add vhosts message metrics from /api/vhosts     - elasticsearch: collect metrics from _cat/indices    - mysql: collect galera cluster metrics     - Allow configuration of the python.d launch command from netdata.conf     - [x509check](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/x509check): smtp cert check support    - [dnsmasq_dhcp](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/dnsmasq_dhcp) : respect conf-dir,conf-file,dhcp-host options     - plugin: respect previously running jobs after plugin restart    - [httpcheck](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/httpcheck) : add current state duration chart     - [springboot2](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/springboot2): fix context- **Health**    - Enable alarm templates for chart dimensions     - Center the chart on the proper chart and time whenever an alarm link is clicked - **Installation/Packages**    - netdata/installer: Add support for offline installations using kickstart.sh or kickstart-static64.sh     - Allow netdata service installation, when docker runs systemd     - Make spec file more consistent with version dependencies    - Fix broken links on web files, for DEB     - Introduce separate CUPS package for DEB #6724 and RPM.

netsec;dmvl4h;1571999859.0;/r/netsec/comments/dmvl4h/five_years_later_how_effective_is_the_mac/;Five Years Later: How Effective Is the MAC Randomization in Practice? The No-at-All Attack;[removed];> We can conclude that 58% of the respondents are NOT familiar with the term “MAC address randomization” and that only 8% replied that they use MAC address randomization on some of their devices. However, these results indicate that the majority of people are not familiar with MAC randomization, whereas very few are actually using it.  Sorry, but I think these findings cast a ridiculous amount of doubt on your research. Where in the world did you find a group where 42% of people were familiar with MAC randomization? The average user doesn’t even know what a MAC address is, let alone why they’d need to randomize it. I’d be surprised if you went to a CS undergrad class and 42% of the class understood what randomization isz   Secondly, your conclusion that because none of the probes had the “locally administrated address bit” set  that all MACs were unique and non-random is missing the point. MAC randomization happens over a larger time frame. Yes, you can track me as I move through a space based on my transmissions. This is a necessary evil as a constant address for a period is the only way for other stations to speak to you. Randomization, however, DOES CORRECTLY kick in over a longer period (hours). This rollover interval is decided by each manufacturer more or less arbitrarily. This means that if you see my device’s probe requests today, you’ll see them from a different address tomorrow. This prevents *long term* tracking which is far more important because it prevents a malicious observer from building a history of a single human.

BankingInfo;dj1xdw;1571290661.0;/r/BankingInfo/comments/dj1xdw/industry_apathy_remains_as_sftr_deadline_looms/;Industry apathy remains as SFTR deadline looms;With six months to go until the reporting deadline for the EU’s Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (SFTR), there remains a worrying level of apathy and unreadiness in the industry, according to market participants.SFTR is looming on the horizon for the industry“Industry surveys show there is a lack of preparedness in the industry and there is a worrying [amount] of organisations who will not be ready by the go-live date,” says Sunil Daswani, SFTR consultant specialist at MarketAxess.SFTR aims to increase transparency on the use as repos and securities lending transactions, and on the risks around entering collateral arrangements.    Both financial and non-financial companies will be required to report such transactions to approved trade repositories.The types of firms affected include banks, investment firms, CCPs, CSDs, insurance, reinsurance undertakings, pension funds, UCITs, AIFs and non-financial counterparties.“While phase one go live implementation is from April 2020, phase two and three organisations still need to prepare if they are trading with a phase one counterparty,” adds Daswani. “These organisations will not be able to ignore preparations until their own go-live deadline.”**Related: [The power of technology to bridge regulatory gaps](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/10/mandates-and-machines-the-power-of-technology-to-bridge-regulatory-gaps/)**Saeed Patel, director of product strategy at KRM22, says: “There is a degree of apathy in the financial industry on the level and magnitude of recent regulatory change experienced. As a consequence, we believe the industry has been late in preparing for SFTR with compliance and IT resources stretched and waiting until the last minute to launch project initiatives.”Patel finds that budgetary concerns have been placing pressure on compliance team headcounts and technology investment in recent years.“There is no question that firms must start to prepare now to comply with the regulatory timetable for the April 2020 go-live.”“SFTR reporting obligations add another level of complexity on transaction reporting when compared to the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid II), with greater level of data fields required to be reported and a new set of validation and conditional rules to comply with,” adds Patel.Daniel Percy-Hughes, director of regulatory change and compliance at Synechron, believes that the biggest challenges are likely to come from firms’ own organisational structures.“Firms whose application stack makes it difficult to change have a higher regression risk, which will face more difficulty than those firms who are already designing and building more scalable solutions,” says Percy-Hughes. These institutions would deploy solutions such as APIs and microservices, or embrace cloud based big data technologies. “Technology, budget and culture all play a part in this,” he adds.**See more: [ISLA tells lenders to avoid “unsustainable risk”](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/09/isla-tells-lenders-how-to-avoid-unsustainable-levels-of-cost-and-risk/)**Unique transaction identifiers (UTI) generation and sharing is still a major hurdle that organisations should address, according to Daswani. “To satisfy the dual nature of requirements, UTIs need to be shared between counterparties.”The challenge is to consistently report on both sides of the transaction. This means being able to not only generate and share UTIs but also accept them from a counterparty.“There are choices to be made around best practice and organisations can choose to follow either a waterfall or bilateral agreement. Organisations need to make fast decisions here, especially for those who still need to determine what their chosen provider to assist in SFTR reporting can do for them relative to internal capabilities,” says Daswani.Regulators will want to set an example early on in the case of non-compliance. “For those who do not comply, there is a risk of being made an example of by the regulator and the consequent potential reputation risk. In addition, there are potentially significant costs associated with non-compliance.“There are industry rumours that the phase one go live deadline may shift – especially given this is currently set for Easter weekend, which from experience isn’t a good time to implement, particularly from an operational perspective.” However, Daswani does believe that there may be a short period of leniency while organisations adapt and address teething issues.For Percy Hughes, as with many other types of transaction reporting, non-compliance means that reporting is incomplete or inaccurate, rather than non-existent. “The most obvious impact to the market is that transparency is of less value than it otherwise might be, and the regulator has information of more limited quality. Firms will face ongoing reconciliation breaks, a backlog of remediation efforts and will always run the ever-present risk of fines.”**Now read: [Delta Capita and DTCC collaborate on SFTR testing](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/09/delta-capita-and-dtcc-collaborate-on-sftr-testing/)**      [* More Details Here](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/10/industry-apathy-remains-as-sftr-deadline-looms/);
BankingInfo;dgd5ph;1570789461.0;/r/BankingInfo/comments/dgd5ph/indonesias_ojk_goes_on_fintech_lender_licensing/;Indonesia’s OJK goes on fintech lender licensing spree;Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) has licensed six start-up fintech lenders since September.The OJK has licensed 13 lenders since AugustPeer-to-peer (P2P) lending start-ups Modalku, a crowdfunding platform for SMEs, KTA Kilat, a cash loan credit platform, Kredit Pintar, a quick-loan provider, Maucash, a big data credit scorer, Finmas, a credit on-demand platform, and KlikACC, a partnership-based loan provider, all secured a business licence from the OJK last month.These firms join fellow start-ups Danamas, Investree, Amartha, Dompet Kilat, KIMO, Toko Modal, and UangTeman. In total, 13 fintech lenders now have licences, but there are still 114 companies registered with the OJK which don’t.With the number nearly doubling month-to-month since August, prospects are looking hopeful for those still waiting on a licence to secure one in the next few months.This exponential increase in licence-issuing puts the country well on the way to a responsible form of financial inclusion which is collectively-driven by the industry and the authorities.Recent licence-securer Finmas says it simply wants “to help serve the Indonesian people”, and is “deeply committed to maintaining the highest standards of transparency, security and strong corporate governance in accordance with OJK regulations and code of ethics”.Finmas’ director of compliance Reza Pratama continues: “This process sends a strong message to the industry and other regulators across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).”Another newly-licensed lender, Investree, expects the OJK’s license to P2P lending firms will “give more trust to the public and investors in a bid to expand the number of borrowers, lenders and the loan distribution, giving more financial access to the whole Indonesian community”.

BankingInfo;dgc18d;1570781678.0;/r/BankingInfo/comments/dgc18d/finovatefall_2019_pfm_is_making_a_comeback/;FinovateFall 2019: PFM is making a comeback;[](https://www.fintechfutures.com/files/2019/10/FinovateFall-2019-1.jpeg)FinovateFall 2019, NY – the biggest Finovate show everFinovateFall 2019 was the biggest Finovate show ever – more than 1,650 attendees joined us for three days of fintech demos, key insights and high-impact networking.The energy in the room was palpable, and all aspects of the financial technology community were on display. There was way too much to take in over the three days for me to do justice to here, but here are a few of the key takeaways from this year’s edition of our New York showcase.**The resurgence of personal finance is a lesson for innovators**The very first personal finance management (PFM) solution I ever saw was on stage at FinovateFall 2010 (roughly ten months after I joined the Finovate team). Yodlee’s APIs were still brand new at that point, and we had a couple of different companies who were using their technology to give banking customers the first account aggregation/budgeting tools.PFMs continued to evolve, getting prettier and more effective, and by 2014 or 2015, it felt like the technology had gone just about as far as it could go. While the technology looked good (and I still maintain that most people would benefit from more awareness of their finances and active budgeting exercises), it was becoming clear that most end-users weren’t too interested in the technology. By 2016, we were getting steady feedback from attendees that they considered personal finance solutions to be more “boring” than “innovative”, and they wanted us to stop putting them on stage.Fast forward to FinovateFall 2019, and the idea that personal finance was “boring” is looking pretty laughable. While nobody was showing a monthly budgeting or expense-categorisation tool, we had several companies on stage who were demoing solutions that are taking PFM to a new level. Instead of focusing on the day-to-day expenses, these companies were tackling the biggest financial decisions that people have to make, ranging from solutions that help students decide how much college debt they can take on to solutions that can help families prepare for unexpected financial shocks like a major illness, divorce, or the unexpected arrival of a new child.Getting these major financial decisions right is absolutely vital for long-term financial health. So is being able to anticipate how major life events will affect your finances. Innovations in this area have the very real potential to make a huge impact on the everyday lives of millions of people, and they represent a win for banks and their customers. Not too boring now, is it?The work being done by early innovators in the PFM space is enabling the resurgence of personal finance we’re seeing now, and with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that PFM innovation didn’t reach and endpoint, it just reached a plateau. Unfortunately, it plateaued in a place that wasn’t very appealing to end-users. The solution, though, wasn’t to abandon it  it was to keep pushing it forward, taking it to a place where it could offer more value and more insight.Will these new takes on personal financial wellness be popular with customers? Only time will tell. But by adding more value, tackling harder questions, and responding more effectively to the pain points of real consumers, it’s pretty clear that personal finance is very alive, and very relevant for the banking industry.For innovators, the lesson is clear: if you’re “bored” with a subset of fintech, don’t abandon it – think about how you can push it forward into someplace exciting.**The rising importance of AI is rippling across fintech**[As I wrote after FinovateSpring](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/06/finovatespring-2019-focusing-on-the-digital-future-of-fintech/) earlier this year, artificial intelligence (AI) is officially here, and the fintech world is shifting because of it. More and more fintechs are using AI in their product stacks, and that’s creating a ripple effect in two key areas: data, and security.If AI is the engine that will power fintech innovation in the next few years, data is its fuel. The quality of that fuel was a key topic at FinovateFall, both among the presenting companies on stage and the attendees around the room.Machine learning (ML) is made possible by large data sets that can “train” a computer to predict the most likely outcomes. The more data it has, the more accurate a machine can become. It’s not just the quantity of data that matters, though, it’s the quality. If you feed AI flawed or incomplete data, you’re going to get flawed or incomplete results. Innovators are responding to this need by offering tech solutions specifically designed to harness, organise and clean data and make it ready for AI. While big data has been a key topic in fintech for a few years now, its importance is skyrocketing, and the industry is responding.The importance of data is also flowing into the security space. Storing personal data securely has always been a priority for banks, and fintech has always had a very robust security sector. Up until now, though, the data that was being secured was more static in nature. By and large, financial institutions simply needed that data to sit somewhere safely until it could be referenced or amended with new account information.Now that data needs to be used in AI solutions, it needs to move to more places, go through more processes, and be seen by more people (and machines). Balancing the usability of data with the obligation to keep it secure at every step of the way is adding a new dimension to the security space, and as AI continues to grow, the size of the problem will continue to grow as well.**Make room for the new kids on the block**FinovateFall 2019 featured more seed-stage and early-stage startups on stage than any of our other shows in recent memory. It’s great to see the creative ideas coming from these new companies, and making sure there’s room in fintech for challengers is vital to the ecosystem. Fintech’s search for “unicorns” will (and should) continue, but complacency is the death of progress, and fresh ideas are the death of complacency.No company exhibited this more successfully than Zogo Finance, whose founder Bolun Li became the youngest innovator to win a [Best of Show trophy](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/09/finovatefall-2019-best-of-show-winners-unveiled/) at a Finovate event. Zogo leverages partnerships with financial institutions to reward kids for learning financial literacy. As someone who sat through (and admittedly made fun of) financial literacy programs designed by banks for kids just three years ago, Bolun is well-positioned to challenge the status quo.

BankingInfo;dfsl5v;1570680286.0;/r/BankingInfo/comments/dfsl5v/ai_understanding_bias_and_opportunities_in/;AI: Understanding bias and opportunities in financial services;It is undeniable that our lives have been made better by artificial intelligence (AI). AI technology allow us to get almost anything, anytime, anywhere in the world at the click of a button  prevent disease epidemics and keep them from spiralling out of control, and generally just make day-to-day life a bit easier by helping us to save energy, book a babysitter, manage our cash and our health all at a very low cost.AI’s penetration into systems and processes in virtually all sectors of business and life has been rapid and global. The speed and scale at which AI is proliferating does however raise the question of how at-risk we may be that the AI we are building for good can also be introducing damaging bias at scale.In this two-part series, I explore the issues with AI constructs, the good bad and the ugly and how we can think about shaping a future through AI in financial services that helps lift people up rather than scaling problems up.By Nadia Sood, CreditEnablePart One**AI in financial services: The good**From using predictive analysis to forecast consumer spending and advising on personal wealth management, to underwriting loans and transaction monitoring – AI’s footprint in financial services can be seen everywhere.AI that has focused on better understanding of customer’s needs and security can have substantial benefits for consumers and several banks have already introduced innovation in this space.In 2018, Goldman Sachs acquired a personal finance app called ClarityMoney. The app pulls users’ transaction information to remind them of spending goals, flags transactions that it finds unusual for a given account, and also moves money into savings for users. It also calculates how much users could save if they cancel some recurring fees in their bank account and even allows users to cancel unwanted subscriptions in just a few steps. This kind of technology revolutionises tracking personal finance.NetOwl is a suite of entity analytics products used by Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). It analyses big data in the form of reports, social media, as well as structured entity data about organisations and places. It uses tools such as semantic search and discovery, compliance monitoring, cyber threat monitoring and risk management. It can even translate names written in foreign languages, perform name matching, and identity resolution. RBC uses the company’s tool EntityMatcher as part of its fraud detection and prevention efforts. Using this software, RBC is able to screen potential new customers against a large set of individuals who have perpetrated fraud against such organisations in the past. NetOwl is able to quickly and accurately match newly identified perpetrators against millions of records. This kind of technology not only benefits the bank using it, but also helps reduce the likelihood that nefarious organisations penetrate the institutions that the rest of society needs in order to function.**What can go wrong**While this technology offers immense benefits, it can equally help perpetuate unhealthy biases. Imagine that your expense tracking software was used by your bank to determine whether you should be eligible for a loan product, but filtered out all people over the age of 50 because the algorithm was constructed by a young technologist assigning a value in an algorithm and who just assumed over 50s didn’t need loans? This would not bring a benefit to over 50-year olds or to the banks who would be missing out on a huge part of a creditworthy pool of customers.Real world examples of this type of bias creeping in with detrimental consequences to women and minorities have already occurred and at scale.In 2014, Amazon developed an internal AI tool for selecting the most promising candidates by examining their job applications, particularly their CVs. However, the software quickly taught itself to prefer male candidates over female ones, penalising CVs that included the words ‘women’, which would often refer to women-only clubs. The software also downgraded graduates from two all-women colleges. This issue stemmed from the fact that this software was trained on data submitted by mostly men over a ten-year period. Despite attempts to fix the bias, Amazon eventually lost faith in the impartiality of the system and abandoned the project. Commenting on this issue, John Jersin, VP of LinkedIn Talent Solutions stated that AI is not ready to make a hiring decision on its own – the technology is not ready just yet. The real issue with the AI that was deployed wasn’t that it wasn’t ready, but rather that the starting point was flawed. The data set used should have included an equal set of data on women and on men, and because it didn’t, the eventual decisioning tool that was constructed by Amazon ended up with an inherent bias against women.These systems are often tested predominately on white men.A similar issue has occurred in the area of AI for facial analysis. A computer scientist and MIT graduate, Joy Buolamwini, found that facial analysis software from tech giants such as IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon, could not detect her dark skin. Her face was only detected when she put on a white mask. This is not surprising as these systems are often tested predominately on white men.After testing facial recognition from these tech giants on various faces, Buolamwini found that all companies performed substantially better on male faces than female faces – and darker-skinned female faces did substantially worse. For lighter skinned men, she found an error rate of less than 1%. However, this figure rose to 35% for darker skinned women. These AI systems also failed to correctly classify the faces of Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and Serena Williams despite the fact that these women are some of the most famous people in the world and generate some of the most significant number of images on the internet.In both these examples, the institutions building the AI could have been smarter about the data-sets they used to form their conclusions and train their AI and better about including more diversity in the groups of people who were building the systems.AI in banking is not immune to this risk. The trick is going to be how to develop AI that doesn’t perpetuate widespread bias that exists today especially in the area of gender.Gender bias in banking services is clearly seen around the globe. A European study found that businesswomen are less able to access loans from banks than businessmen. Male entrepreneurs in Europe are 5% more likely to successfully get a loan for their business from banks than women. Even those women that are able to access loans are subjected to higher interest rates, with an average of 0.5% more on a business loan than men. It is not the case here that women are worse at business than men and so present worse credit risks – the average venture-backed technology company run by a woman is started with a third less capital yet yields annual revenues that are 12% higher than those run by men.The substantial social benefit of AI if applied properly is that it can help spotlight the strong performing, good eggs in the lending basket. For instance, it can read between the lines in deciding whether to lend to an individual earlier excluded by a lending officer because the entrepreneur is a woman, especially since the gender of the entrepreneur has nothing to do with the ability of the individual to repay debt. AI can help eliminate the discrimination arising from cases such as this.At a societal level AI stands the chance of democratising the access to capital for women and minorities. But AI needs to be developed in a consequent thoughtful manner for this promise to be delivered on.In the second part of this series, I explore how AI can be applied as a force for good by financial institution to expand the pool of clients to be more inclusive.An objective analysis can highlight what gender biases may cloud – and banks would thus be less likely to filter out women-owned businesses without first being made aware of their merits and creditworthiness. With time, AI can be a transformative tool in shrinking these biases.********_**By Nadia Sood, CEO, CreditEnable.

Business_Analyst;dj4c2f;1571307367.0;/r/Business_Analyst/comments/dj4c2f/secretive_data_firm_palantir_cashed_in_by/;Secretive Data Firm Palantir Cashed In by Skipping the 2019 IPO Market;Named after an all-seeing magical artifact with the power to scry into the past and future of the Lord of the Rings universe, Palo Alto-based Palantir raised $2.75 billion earlier this month for a valuation of $28 billion.That has allowed the secretive company to stay secret for a while longer. While Palantir, backed and founded by President Donald Trump advisor Peter Thiel, has hinted an initial public offering, it’s now not likely to happen until 2023, per a [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-05/palantir-is-said-to-seek-funding-on-private-market-delay-ipo) report. The president of the firm’s French businesses recently revealed that the company had revenue of close to [$1 billion in 2018](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-16/palantir-posted-nearly-1-billion-in-2018-sales-executive-says), but it’s not clear whether the firm is profitable.Its fresh round of funding goes towards a growing a [business based on big data](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-big-data-analysis/)—more specifically organizing, unifying, and making sense of the vast troves of information created by the tech and internet revolution (think chat logs, street cameras, credit card statements, airline records, raw information usually siloed within their own disparate houses, but able to combine into a picture). The company’s software to sort through the disparate data points and find often difficult to spot connections.The 15-year-old company made its [name by working with the Pentagon](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-big-data-analysis/) and CIA through the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and may or may not have played a role in the capture of Osama bin Laden. What does Palantir do?----------------------Beyond its uses in foreign spycraft, Palantir has also been used in police work. The Los Angeles Police Department signed with the company in 2009, and Palantir helped aggregate [several state, federal, and local level databases into one](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Impact-Study-LAPD.pdf) searchable system—one that eventually helped catch a killer nearly two years [after the murder](https://www.wired.com/story/drive-los-angeles-police-track-every-move/). New Orleans meanwhile had been working with Palantir to find potential victims and criminals, though that program ended in 2018, according to [the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/15/17126174/new-orleans-palantir-predictive-policing-program-end). Palantir also helped the Netherlands National Police Services identify a network of child pornographers [in 2010](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Impact_Study_Fighting_Child_Pornography.pdf), by tying names to aliases used in chat logs, Skype records, and more.While its contracts [with the U.S. government](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/) bolstered the company’s profile, it has also branched out by adding corporate clients under its Superman inspired Metropolis system: that includes the likes of banking behemoth JPMorgan Chase.However, the company’s data collection practices have drawn scrutiny.Palantir’s software was reportedly used at JPMorgan to monitor employees, aggregating among other things browser histories, GPS locations from company cell phones, emails, and sign-in times. That information, in turn, could be used to root out not only say a rogue trader or an illicit conversation but also find employees that could potentially be a risk to the company and therefore justify additional monitoring, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/). JPMorgan said it had “drastically” pulled back on the partnership, following a string of other corporate breakups with the company, including Hershy, [Coca-Cola](https://fortune.com/fortune500/coca-cola/), and Nasdaq.In J.R.R. Tolkien’s magnum opus, the seven Palantiri are powerful objects used to communicate and influence those within the trilogy’s universe. It is neither good nor bad—having been used during the storyline to turn a once great and powerful wizard toward the darkness, but also eventually aid in the destruction of the one ring. ‘Dangerous indeed, but not to all,’ said Aragorn, a main character in the story who ultimately uses a Palantir to distract the evil side from its impending defeat.Is Palantir’s technology itself currently in the right hands and being used for the right purposes? Its detractors argue no.Palantir and political controversy----------------------------------Beyond data privacy concerns, Palantir is now being criticized for working with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency—a government arm recently front and center over its role in separating families. The company has worked with ICE since 2014, with ICE is reportedly using a Palantir-built system to conduct background checks (Palantir has said that it specifically works with the cross-border criminal investigations side of ICE, rather than its [immigration enforcement](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/business/dealbook/investor-bias-discrimination.html) division, though recently, that same division was responsible for the arrest of 680 [undocumented migrant workers](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/us/mississippi-immigration-raids-children/index.html)).Outwardly, CEO Alex Karp (who supported Hillary Clinton’s run for president in 2016) has stood by the relationship, echoing again that its product was merely a tool, telling [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-22/the-complicated-politics-of-palantir-s-ceo) shortly after Palantir renewed its contract with ICE earlier this year: “We at Palantir have a view that in societies where there is a functioning democracy—meaning there are checks and balances enforced by a functioning judiciary—we will provide the software and will continue to provide the software.”But internally, Palantir employees have also questioned whether Palantir can take such a hands-off approach. According to [_the Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/22/war-inside-palantir-data-mining-firms-ties-ice-under-attack-by-employees/?arc404=true) citing sources inside the company, some 60 employees signed a petition in August calling for Palantir to direct its financial gains from its ICE contracts to nonprofits.Unlike its fictional counterpart, this Palantir may well be part of those checks and balances as corporations increasingly question their role in democracy.### More must-read stories from _Fortune_:—[Trump’s tax bill has cost homeowners a trillion dollars   ](https://fortune.com/2019/10/10/how-trump-tax-bill-affects-homeowners-middle-class/)—Inside JP Morgan, [moving on from WeWork](https://fortune.com/2019/10/13/jpmorgan-wework-adam-neumann-ipo/) is proving to be a messy proposition    —[What is Oyo?](https://fortune.com/2019/10/14/what-is-oyo-behind-softbanks-latest-high-growth-high-valuation-bet/) Behind Softbank’s latest high-growth, high-valuation bet    —Why the [next recession may feel very different](https://fortune.com/2019/09/02/next-recession-different-2008-great-recession/) than 2008    —Trump’s tariffs were supposed to ding China, but [the U.S. economy is getting hit 2.5x harder   ](https://fortune.com/2019/10/08/trump-china-tariffs-trade-war-us-economy-impact/)_Don’t miss the daily_[_Term Sheet_](https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/nloptin?nl=TERM_SHEET&source=LinkStack)_, Fortune’s newsletter on deals and dealmakers._         [* More Details Here](https://fortune.com/2019/10/17/what-is-palantir-ipo-market-2019/);
Business_Analyst;dflq6r;1570647996.0;/r/Business_Analyst/comments/dflq6r/artificial_intelligence_could_be_a_14_trillion/;Artificial Intelligence Could Be a $14 Trillion Boon to the Global Economy—If It Can Overcome These Obstacles;Global growth is stalling. Trade wars are hammering manufacturers, from Shanghai to Stuttgart to Seattle. But, awful as today’s economic outlook appears, Industry 4.0 is alive and well, its most ardent backers say.Industry 4.0 is the catch-all term for the implementation by businesses of big data, improved robotics and artificial intelligence systems. And it’s still expected to be a major driver in global growth over the next decade, and beyond. Yes, even in manufacturing.By 2035, this A.I.-powered push will provide a $14 trillion boost to the global economy, consulting giant Accenture predicts.That’s the assessment of Marc Carrel-Billiard, global senior managing director at Accenture Labs, who rattled off these numbers during his keynote presentation at [World Summit A.I.](https://info.worldsummit.ai/eventprogramme) in Amsterdam on Wednesday. By way of example, he cited research that traced the progress in one growing area of A.I.-powered automation: call centers. Five years ago, A.I. bots could successfully resolve one out every ten customer phone calls. Today, he said, it’s 60%.Moreover, he predicted, this push to automate will not be the jobs-killer the more bearish economists out there fear.But before technologists take a victory lap, there’s a caveat.They’re not a threat to jobs, he says, “because these systems are not very intelligent.” AI—and its many iterations: machine learning, natural language processing, machine vision, image- and voice-recognition—is well adapted at highly specialized tasks. It does a decent job telling you what the weather will be tomorrow, or ordering movie tickets or helping you find the fastest route home during the evening commute. All manner of businesses are using A.I. increasingly on the enterprise level to make sense of the vast flows of structured and unstructured data they collect to root out inefficiencies, and save costs.But, as Carrel-Billiard notes, A.I. still has a blind spot. It’s trained to interpret certain data sets, not infer meaning or context from a complicated world. A.I. is a specialist, not a generalist, he says. And therefore, much work is needed to make these systems truly intelligent.Gary Marcus, professor of psychology and neural science at New York University and author of _[Rebooting AI](http://rebooting.ai/)_, is even more frank in his assessment. He calls deep learning— the subset of A.I. that can make sense of huge amounts of data with little to no oversight from human minders—a misnomer. It’s good at narrowly focused tasks, but he questions its much-ballyhooed potential to, for example, revolutionize transportation (self-driving cars) and medicine (analyzing huge volumes of MRI scans for signs of cancerous growths). “Deep learning is no substitute for deep understanding,” he says.“The number of radiologists who’ve been replaced by deep-learning systems?” he asks. “Zero.”Carrel-Billiard, for one, believes that in order for A.I. systems to be truly effective they need to be designed to be accountable, transparent and free of bias—not just super-fast task rabbits. Only then will such systems reach their full potential.On day one of the World Summit A.I., much of the early discussion was about the need to build so-called ethical A.I. systems. Marcus and Carrel-Billiard, among others, challenged the development community to build A.I. systems that are accountable, transparent and free of bias.Unless it’s responsible, Carrel-Billiard says, “nobody will trust it, and nobody will use it.”### More must-read stories fromFortune:—How[the man who nailed Madoff](https://fortune.com/2019/10/03/ge-accounting-markopolos-madoff/)got [GE](https://fortune.com/fortune500/general-electric/) wrong   —[Most Powerful Women 2019](https://fortune.com/most-powerful-women/2019): See who made the list   —Meet the women leading [Netflix](https://fortune.com/fortune500/netflix/) into[the streaming wars   ](https://fortune.com/longform/women-netflix-streaming-wars/)—Why[the next recession](https://fortune.com/2019/09/02/next-recession-different-2008-great-recession/)may feel very different than 2008   —Old Navy is about to[sail away from Gap Inc.](https://fortune.com/longform/old-navy-gap-inc-split-ceo-sonia-syngal-challenges-sales/)—and into some choppy waters   Subscribe to Fortune’s[The Loop newsletter](https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/nloptin?nl=the_loop&source=LinkStack)for the latest on the revolutions in energy, technology, and sustainability.

As digital citizens, it’s our responsibility to keep track of the issues that matter – writes*** [Nayef Al-Rodhan]^^1 ***.***When the newly appointed European Commissioners officially take up their posts on 1st November, some very important technology policy questions will once again come into view. These are decisions that could fundamentally reshape the business models of Big Tech firms, redraw the landscape of competition and affirm Europe as the dominant global rule maker when it comes powerful tech companies and the effects they have on our politics and culture.It is indispensable that we keep checks on technological progress. Human innovation is advancing at breakneck speeds. Things we never dreamed of are becoming reality, such as synthetic biology, bioinformatics, cognitive enhancement, genetic engineering, 3D and 4D printing, Artificial intelligence, automated weapon systems, invisibility cloaks, quantum computing and even neuromorphic computing.  Along with their obvious massive potential, these advancements also pose significant risks to social stability, equality, human dignity, free will, national and global security, and even to the very survival of our species.How can we make sure that these constantly evolving technological innovations don’t destroy humanity or exacerbate inequalities and privacy intrusions? Emerging technologies offer states more instruments and means for control and surveillance, often infringing on civil liberties. The balance between States’ need to know in the name of security and the respect for privacy must be pursued more fervently. Also non-state actors like large multi-national corporate entities that collect massive amounts of personal data, need to be better regulated.We must balance the dizzying potentials of technological advancements with security and ethical concerns, and move from risks to regulations. This must also include mechanisms for overseeing the overseers – or ‘regulating the regulators’, so it is equally important that we are aware of the powers that be when it comes to regulating the global landscape.Their ambition must be to promote my previously published governance-based  [9 dignity needs]^^2  – which include*: reason, security, human rights, accountability, transparency, justice, opportunity, innovation, and inclusiveness*, and balance them with the 3 human nature attributes : *emotionality, amorality and egoism –* without stifling innovation.In the race to regulate Big Tech, it has in recent years become overwhelmingly clear that the first mover becomes the primary global rule maker.  The group of policymakers first able to put forward a vision of regulation at global level has an evident advantage – enabling them to pressure other regulatory bodies into embracing their rules, even when contrary to their domestic agendas.With a large market of 500 million citizens, the majority of whom are comparatively wealthy on a global scale, and equipped with the ability to coordinate action on controversial issues such as privacy, competition, and digital tax, the EU has established itself as the world’s regulatory pacesetter.In these spheres, the EU has projected itself onto the global stage with particular force in the last year and a half, by advancing its regulatory prerogatives within the agendas of international forums such as the G7 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).Crucially, Brussels is emerging as the most important formulator of antitrust regulation. Earlier this year, European officials published a report which pushed for regulators to more heavily scrutinize proposed takeovers based on how companies used data.Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s highly interventionist competition commissioner, who has launched several high profile cases against Google, Amazon and Apple, has been reappointed to her role for an unprecedented second term. So the trend that has been set in motion on these issues is looking likely to continue, if not grow stronger. She has already recently warned Silicon Valley that she will move beyond fines during her second term and look at other measures to ensure a fair playing field.Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming head of the EU’s executive arm, has hinted at new laws on artificial intelligence and the use of big data within 100 days of taking office next month.  She and her team are also reportedly considering creating a dedicated multibillion-euro fund to support and promote the European technology sector.As digital consumers around the globe continue to pay closer attention to their relationships with companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple — whose users number in the billions worldwide — it seems inevitable that one region needs to begin taking the lead in debating and implementing appropriate forms of regulation.Effective decision-making by the next Commission, undertaken with the aim of defending basic rights while energising digital markets through the principles of fairness and competition could have the potential to revolutionise the digital economy – bringing about a world in which there are many more winners, rather than a small number of companies whose established advantages skew the market in favour of monopolies. What remains to be seen is whether these difficult but necessary questions will be tackled head on, or conveniently avoided.'''[Governing the Global Commons - EU Reporter](https://reddit.com//r/europe/comments/dl1583)[Go1dfish undelete link](http://r.go1dfish.me/r/europe/comments/dl1583)[unreddit undelete link](https://unreddit.com/r/europe/comments/dl1583)Author: /u/NayefAlRodhan1: `www.*ust**n*blehi****y.com*about-nay*f*alr*dhan`  2: `blo*.ap*on**ne.**g/2*18/**/16/a-*eu*o-phi*o*op**-of**i*nity-ba*ed-governance/`  Unknown links are censored to prevent                         spreading illicit content.;

From its modest beginnings a couple of years prior as an idea in the brains of researchers, big data has turned into a backbone in the business world. Organizations needed to change their advertising. They would need to filter through their business information, click-through and general behavior of their audience. According to a survey, 99% of businesses are going to implement big data analytics and [**AI**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/using-artificial-intelligence-in-your-business/) in the near future. The telecom industry, financial services and healthcare are the industries to have embraced big data with technology. There are various ways you can utilize big data to plan your business model to improve things in advertising. Let us see how [**big data**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/deciding-the-need-of-a-big-data-infrastructure/) can help your business to succeed.  ## Five Ways Big Data Can Help Your Business To Grow- ### 1. Data transfer-As new businesses start to work on problem solving issues and also administrations, a catch-22 situation frequently emerges. At one side, there is not sufficient data to build a definite product on. On the other, the information with which such an item can be made is often difficult to get without setting off to the market with a minimum viable product first. Consider the possibility that the curve could be minimized and the innovation procedure quickened. That is the thing that information sharing does–interfacing businesses to the datasets they have to derive innovative insights. The integrity of the data will draw more companies to participate since they’ll be able to rely on the accuracy of the data.### 2. Marketing-Personalization has consistently been a need for advertisers. Businesses have endeavored to utilize personalization to shape a closer bond with clients in mail merges, PPC retargeting campaigns and businesses also. It’s reason is so simple- the more associated an individual feels with a brand, the more probable they are to work with it. Appropriate execution of big data analytics will enable you to improve product data and also foresee client inclinations in a manner that expands conversations. Contacting more individuals is never again the need- the most significant factor in marketing success is targeted people, who are likely to buy at just the right time. From deciding the request in which to present products to creating particularly targeted email advertising campaigns, more information in your customer relationship management(CRM) software rises to more chances to engage with clients on an individual level.  ### 3. Security-Rise in online transactions results in increase of fraud rates. Hackers have brought down a few businesses online and offline with the malware attacks like the infamous Wannacry virus, less sophisticated but equally devastating social engineering attacks. Losing client information to an attack can decimate your business’ reputation, aside from the money related losses which would almost certainly happen. Big data allows organizations to implement software which would expand protects on delicate data by utilizing on an assortment of technologies including video recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, machine learning engines and also automation.### 4. Customer Service and Retention-[**Chatbots**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/how-to-create-engaging-chatbots-for-your-business/) have just turned out to be very popular as a methods for organizations to give high level customer service without the customary time, budget and also staffing requirements. Another way big data can boost your business’s customer satisfaction is by guiding to help you to design customer responsive products and services. Using right dataset, you can analyze and find the features which your customers prize the most and which ones you need to eliminate. The data can be from surveys, polls or tracking technologies, research.### 5. Human Resource-While HR executives is commonly best served by having a human make a final decision, workforce data analytics can be hugely helpful for HR staff in any organization. The method of matching keywords to job descriptions for shortlisting candidates is no longer effective. Because there are so many points to consider before making a hiring decision apart from mentioned on a resume. Data driven AI projects can quickly assess education, experience, skill sets, job titles, certifications, geography, social media activity, background checks and a variety of other parameters to recognize the best candidate for a position. The quality of staff delivered by such an escalated procedure will reflect in the higher productivity and also benefit of your business;I get enough of this bullshit spam in my inbox at work.

I kind of help design applications, do POC's/prototyping, code/develop applications. I earn a healthy salary and support my family well.I started my career in Mainframes, then forced myself to transition to ETL/datawarehousing (SQL, Ab Initio, Netezza, Oracle etc). I moved to Big Data(thanks to my boss) with zero experience and a salary hit  and have been working on on-prem hadoop for the past few yrs. Tech stack is - Python/Hive/Impala/PySpark/Python to name a few. Currently prototyping with Scala/Kudu/kafka (by learning just enough for my use case).I have always survived by learning just enough on the job with no formal training except for Mainframes. Since, I have always learned on the job, everything I know is through my experience and practice - thus leading to less theoretical/foundational knowledge. I don't get enough time to get the foundation right on anything.Since, I don't come from oops background, I have always found it diff to understand oops concepts. I find JAVA/Scala diff to grasp. I seem to have a mental block against Java/Scala/Oops concepts. If you give me a problem, I can find a solution and get the work done. This quality of mine along with my work ethic has helped me throughout. Even though I have bosses who have trust and confidence in me and have high opinion on my skills, I personally don't and consider myself average.I am that person who can get things done, but, can't say I am good at this one thing.How can I improve and move forward in my career?;

I copied a bunch of files from my Win10 machine over to it, then setup in esxi a win2k16 server and attached this as a 2nd drive. I set up plex and started having loading issues. I thought maybe that 1 file was bad, so I copied that old directory again and windows was giving a bunch of errors. I do a uninterruptible copy app and had errors all over. I disconnect and put it back into my desktop, same files erroring out, did a hdd smart check and said all is good. I copy all the files over to it again and put it back into the esxi server.Same behavior, I try and copy existing folders again as a test and fails/errors all over.So as another test I just formated it in VMware and set it as 1 big data store and mounted that on to the server. So far no errors, and I keep copying 200gb folders over and over to test and it still seems good.So is there an inherent risk with the passthrough?My machine isn't standard, its a simple dell 7040 and the hdd in question is a new WD red drive.;

I'm just saying they have to break their fantasies about big data. Big data is a technology that can revolutionize things when they are used in the Internet of Things.

These things you need to know about it.;&#x200B https://preview.redd.it/2bwy7xbkyor31.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9b5921de7edaff0b91425d6b7e876edad589157October 8, 2019, we are excited to announce that the DxChain Mainnet Alpha is officially launched!  Autumn is the season of harvest. After the release of DxChain Testnet 3.0, the DxChain team has been working hard to complete the commitment and finally brought the achievement of this stage to our community — DxChain Mainnet Alpha, which showcases the construction of master chain has basically finished, and features such as smart contracts, storage contracts, DPoS consensus algorithms, mining and so on have been implemented and work stably.  What’s the meaning of Mainnet Alpha?  It is well known that mainnet is the fundamental of a blockchain project, cryptocurrency is not a real blockchain technology until the Mainnet launch. Any concepts, ideas or theories are unrealizable. DxChain has been committed to building a secure and efficient decentralized big data storage and computing network from the beginning. The construction, development and performance of DxChain network are what DxChain engineers caring about.  The release of DxChain Mainnet Alpha represents that DxChain has basically completed the construction of the public chain framework, in which smart contracts, storage contracts, DPoS consensus algorithms, mining and other functions have been developed  also represents DxChain's transformation from cryptocurrency to a real public chain. There will be more commercial applications and greater ecosystems established on DxChain in the future. DxChain is about to change from a line of code to a blockchain project that can generate real technical value for the real world!  Highlights of DxChain Mainnet Alpha  To better support the new economy model, DxChain engineers conducted an in-depth study on algorithms. In this release, the DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus algorithm was implemented to replace the previously used PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm.  PoW, the most long-lived consensus algorithm in the blockchain world, requires some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. However, the costly and time-consuming characteristics are not applicable to the economic model of DxChain.  DPoS, considered to be an improved version of the PoS (Proof of Stake) algorithm, is a more democratic consensus algorithm. The form is similar to the election of the United States Congress that the holder of the cryptocurrency can vote for the representative. The representative's duty is to conduct transaction verification and generate the blocks. Conversely, the holder of the cryptocurrency has the right to reelection if the representative fails to fulfill his/her duties.  Nowadays, DPoS as a consensus mechanism is applied to more and more cryptocurrencies. The elected nodes are responsible for generating blocks and verification, greatly reducing the generation time and confirmation time, and greatly increasing the total throughput of the chain. DxChain stores the scene. Compared with Bitcoin takes 10 minutes, DxChain only takes 2\~10 seconds to generate a block. In addition, after the implementation of the DPoS algorithm, DxChain's TPS (transactions per second) will leap to nearly a thousand to guarantee the contract processing speed on the chain.  Figure1. DxChain DPoS Process  Future Plan  The DxChain team has a solid plan to fulfill all goals and will complete one task after another step by step. In the last quarter of 2019, we are fully sprinting to the goal of Mainnet. The main working content includes (but not limited to):  Getting on large-scale testing for network security and stability  Implementing DPoS rewarding and punishment system, optimizing DPoS algorithm  Optimizing storage-related features, increasing the data upload and download speed  Adding support on Windows operating system  In terms of the release this time, we will gradually hold a series of community events and invite more DxChain supporters and blockchain technology enthusiasts to participate in the testing, so as to jointly promote the DxChain ecosystem construction and development.  Please stay tuned to the events upcoming shortly!

See video here: [https://youtu.be/do\_aeA7ZRIk](https://youtu.be/do_aeA7ZRIk)Total time from takeoff to touchdown is 1h 38m 11s.  Total number of jumps is 76 hops (including all refueling stops), which is about 27% shorter than the best route computed by the Spansh Neutron Router, and about 11% shorter than the previous record time (credit: CMDR St4r Fox).To find this route, I implemented my own A\* search algorithm that exhaustively computes optimal routes from EDSM star map data, taking into account jump range increases due to fuel consumption, and fast refueling opportunities due to main sequence stars co-located with neutron stars.Efficiently computing non-approximate, optimal routes under these constraints turns out to be a fun programming challenge.  The EDSM database contains over 41M stars, over 1.3M of which are neutron stars, forming a large search graph of about 1.8 x 10\^12 edges.  To reduce the search space without sacrificing route quality, I found I could compute jump neighborhoods without big data structures by sorting star data into stripes in the x-y plane, and then using a combination of binary search, pairwise heaps, memory-mapped files, and Intel SSE intrinsics for fast distance calculations.  On my 2.8GHz PC, this approach finds optimal routes (without approximation) in about 1 minute with a memory footprint of under 1GB, despite the volume of data.Interestingly, the algorithm concluded that adding an 8T fuel tank to my Anaconda improves efficiency, at least for this trip, contrary to prevailing wisdom.  Even though it makes the ship heavier, it reduces refueling stops enough to offset its weight.Credit goes to CMDR furrycat for reverse-engineering the equations that govern FSD booster fuel consumption, and the many explorers who have contributed star data to EDSM!Happy flying!

Awesome job. o7#Can you provide some more info on you program? Which language did you use? And will you make it publicly available?#Kind of new to ED, what is Colonia D:?#Nice!  Galaxy's not so big after all.  I did some similar math (regarding the fuel tank) on my explorer build, too.  It comes down to would you rather stop to refuel, or lose range from carrying extra fuel.  I think I determined 64T was ideal for me.  That was a surprise as I'd been carrying 48 before then.  But I don't think I was as efficient as you--I haven't checked your list, but did you take advantage of double stars for neutron boosting and refueling in one stop?#Good job, where is the github link? 😁#This is awesome, I love it!  I haven't watched your whole vid yet, but I noticed you have 7.2 ton 5D thrusters.  You can gain an extra 1/2 ly range (by my math) if you use 4D Clean G1 Drive Distributor (4 tons).  Still, your build is the least of the work you did here--I'm amazed at the route you found, so cool!  Note: you'd have to engineer the 4Ds in another ship since you can't equip them to the Anaconda until after they're modded.#I only started learning java and have no idea what you did, but it's sure sounds like a big brain play) good job, man.#Hi.

Report should be out very soon in Sept (if they follow the schedule as with previous reports)  So, now, if you think a little, there are two options:  \- Vechain Foundation stopped selling Vet completely to fund ongoing operations (self-sufficient) and just doing buyback  \- Vechain Foundation is still selling Vet to fund ongoing operations and doing buyback at the same time. These are two different pools for different purposes.  If the second option is the case, selling pressure should be almost equal to buying pressure  This is very important concept to understand.  &#x200B   We could only analyze which option is true when Vol. 9 comes out covering Aug-Oct, which should be in December#Come on sunny press that damn button#[me, when my bos has 1 bad day and says ""you dont know what its like to lose money""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d44LyYL3GkY)#A lot of you sound like a bunch of pansies that have been crying about the buyback. It’s been weeks in this sub with the same crap. It’s been fucking annoying scrolling through the same whining comments day after day, sucking the life out of this sub.   You’ve either been butthurt about why they’re not buying back, why they haven’t, when they’re buying back, and why they’re buying back. You’re crying and whining because you’re expectations are out of line from reality. You expect the buyback to pump your bags. And when you find out that that’s not the case, you’re even more butthurt.  How about this for a reality check. No matter where they’re buying back from, or the reason, the foundation DID NOT HAVE TO BUY BACK ANYTHING. That’s right, they could’ve just let the free market run it course. They could’ve easily allowed the 3+ BILLION VET get dumped on the free market over the next 12 months. What do you think would’ve happened to the price then?   Oh you don’t like where the foundation is buying from? Sell your stack of VET and get lost already. Just spare the rest of us your delusions and constant whining. FUCKKK#Rumor has it the VeChain boni just got dumped. But instead of VET dumping, because of the buyback, Bitcoin dumped. What a smart move!#Only 10 more days to the next OceanEx meetup. I'll be there to ask questions, do you guys have anything you wish to know?

I would like to see more updates if possible soon for devs too.  I was trying to link the back end Node of a mainnet to the VeChain network, but for some reason it would murder my hard drive even though the blocks would dissipate over a time.  I am trying a setup with AWS for the node next. But even then it would overrun the capacity of the hard drive for AWS at one point or another. I’m gonna have to find a work around.  The only problem that I have for now with using things through connex, the recommended way, is that its forcing people to use a portal not everyone has. If its a chromium build (which I’ll look into) then it should be stable across multiple device platforms.   Still though, if I build it the way I am setting it up, then pretty much any user from any portal whether it be Brave, chrome, safari and even later with React Native I could have mobile apps, is easily available for everyone.#Well, I dropped buyback rating from 4/5 to 1/5 on my price analysis list.   I expect it to be fully completed, but since there is new unknown seller providing liquidity to the open market, that won't do much for the price.

I think diehard fans will be upset about that, but I always stay objective.  It feels I have enough facts to give my **best guess** what is happening here.  I believe there are two separate processes going on: funding ongoing technological development, which we can see mentioned in every executive report and the buyback.  From the reports we can see Foundation spends about 1-1,5 Bil Vet quarterly for all processes: employees bonuses, R&D, conferences, research grants and everything like that  So this buyback basically should cover those expenses, and both those processes should cancel each other, price wise  &#x200B   Negative side: Vet isn't been bought back from old holders  Positive side: a lot less selling pressure from funding ongoing operations and other expenses (that is, about 1-1,5 bil Vet quarterly)  &#x200B   **We need two missing pieces of puzzle to stop guessing and to make real conclusions** about that:  Executive report Vol 8 (this will cover only July when buyback was active) coming very soon and executive report Vol 9 covering all interesting months Aug-Oct, coming only in December  &#x200B   I'll be writing next posts when those reports are out.#Welp - Here's to upping my stack another 10%.#https://twitter.com/BuyBackBot/status/1177078778994073605?s=19 https://twitter.com/BuyBackBot/status/1177078401636741120?s=19  Foundation had never transferred to the buy back around this time.#I was lucky enough to be able to increase my stack by 25% today. I'm severely underwater on VET (original x-node holder) but I'm a believer in the project long term. At a minimum, I believe with DCA'ing, I can come out on top. Best case scenario, VET becomes what I think a lot of people on this forum think it will become and we will reap the requisite rewards. I know a lot of you are feeling emotionally drained with this price action. If you can afford it, keep DCA'ing. If the project doesn't work out to our expectations (I don't believe this will be the case), it may be your best chance to recover your losses.#Yet another ""I now have enough for a node"" comment :)  Just bought another 300K-ish, stuffed it on my ledger and, after a bit of a hassle and calling the ledger bad names (I think that helped!)

If every millionaire in the world wanted to own one, there wouldn't be enough to go around.#I'm actually quite shocked at the accusations being thrown around in here, so here's some information regarding what buybacks are for. Before anyone says it, I'm aware VeChain isn't a stock.  Stock buybacks refer to the repurchasing of shares of stock by the company that issued them. A buyback occurs when the issuing company pays shareholders the market value per share and re-absorbs that portion of its ownership that was previously distributed among public and private investors. With stock buybacks, aka share buybacks, the company can purchase the stock on the open market or from its shareholders directly. In recent decades, share buybacks have overtaken dividends as a preferred way to return cash to shareholders. Though smaller companies may choose to exercise buybacks, blue-chip companies are much more likely to do so because of the cost involved.  Reasons for Buybacks   Since companies raise equity capital through the sale of common and preferred shares, it may seem counter-intuitive that a business might choose to give that money back. However, there are numerous reasons why it may be beneficial to a company to repurchase its shares, including ownership consolidation, undervaluation, and boosting its key financial ratios.  Keywords here are ownership consolidation and undervaluation.#Wait they did the buyback but it came from a vechain wallet to binance and oceanex.

I signed up for a DNV GL Seminar a few weeks ago that was made available to the public for free. I got my calendar notification this morning and live streamed the talk - in which Sven Edgren (DNVGL, Head of Digital Transformation) was speaking.  Two main topics were covered - MyStory and the Carbon Ecosystem.   I have been here since the Daily threads started - so am fairly up to date with most VeChain related news. However, a few things stood out to me:  1. In passing, Sven says that DNV GL, PwC and BMW are Authority Node holders. An educated guess would have told you this anyway, IMO. Although it was nice to hear. 2. MyStory is working with a Global #3 apparel manufacturer on sustainability products - H&M possibly? Pilot or live - I don't know  [https://imgur.com/a/HrzxiiI](https://imgur.com/a/HrzxiiI)  3. Sven mentions that DNV GL are currently speaking to 3 European cities about the Carbon Ecosystem (that is obviously built on the VeChain blockchain)  Link:  [https://www.dnvgl.com/events/webinar-digital-and-blockchain-solutions-designed-for-ecosystem-and-supply-chain-transparency-154904](https://www.dnvgl.com/events/webinar-digital-and-blockchain-solutions-designed-for-ecosystem-and-supply-chain-transparency-154904)   I don't have time stamps available - but assume someone sad like me will listen through the whole thing anyway (1hr).  I may also have missed some things.  All publicly available stuff. This is the second public DNV GL talk that I have live streamed - the first was with Brett Gray (DNV GL) where I was able to ask questions at the end. I recommend doing the same for future events - they provide great insight.  Sven comes across very well and speaks with a good level of clarity. Very happy to have him shilling VeChain to Enterprises for us.#[https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/\~dfk/vita.pdf](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~dfk/vita.pdf)   Published September 17, 2019  David Kotz from  Dartmouth College got 75 000$ grant from Vechain (page 5)  Vechain, Inc. $75,000 for 2018–20 PI Privacy-preserving storage of mHealth data using blockchains.  &#x200B   Means that Vechain is into research for Mobile Health Apps.

However, today we see almost no gain on VET, it's been fairly stable for the whole day while others continue to recover. It's kinda safe to assume there was no buyback happening yesterday/today.  If we assume they won't be buying during the weekends, there's only 8 working days left to obtain $3,500,000 of VET. This amounts to more than 100,000,000 VET bought per day.  Basic trading rule states that the best strategy to accumulate would be to DCA in regular intervals. It's literally what most of us have been doing for the past 18 months. Whoever is in charge of buying back wouldn't be that stupid to try to time the markets.  I don't know what would feel worse, to learn they were buying every day but we still ended up being the biggest losers most of the time, or that they might not fulfill their promise. Anyways, 8 days left. Let's see what happens.#Let me play devil's advocate here a minute..  DNV GL - a digital assurance company that is partnered with vechain helping to authenticate products on the blockchain. I thought the entire purpose of the blockchain was for it to be the trust machine - to not have to have third parties enter the equation. I understand how the blockchain is an immutable ledger but the way vechain (and in particular ""my story"") is handling this is still using a third party DNV GL that the end consumer has to trust.#>More photos from  @sunshinelu24 's (#VeChain CEO) ""Enabler for Mass Adoption"" Keynote from  @WXblockchain .  >. #Blockchain #WXblockchain #wxsummit #China $VET $VTHO  https://twitter.com/bsc44_x/status/1173940473179734016?s=20#Rising price falling volume again,running out of sellers#Im getting the feeling that 2021 and beyond are going to be years of sheer joy for whoever got into vechain early on in 2017 / early 2018, even at somewhat unfavorable price points.

Say for instance a person had accumulated enough VET to split it in half  and have two accounts with an economic node. For instance 1million in one account, 1 million in another. You could now have two strength nodes. According to Vechain Stats the VTHO generation would be the same as having one account with 2 million VET and one strength node. So the extra node will not generate more VTHO but could it be worth something to sell one day?   Disclaimer: I do not even have enough VET for even one node much less two. I am just curious of the advantages to either of these scenarios.#BNB will be listed on Binance US since launch  [https://twitter.com/cz\_binance/status/1174252381632114689](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1174252381632114689)  , which again proves my theory:  **a coin isn't a ""security"" if there is enough money paid to play.** BNB does token burns and it doesn't matter. CZ wants it to be an utility)  So if Sunny paid enough, Vet will be on Binance US regardless of ""muh security, muh VTHO"" pleb fears. Question is: did he?#Let’s talk VTHO. What’s the price in 2025?

Who knows.# 7 Asian Blockchain Leaders On Interoperability, Regulation, And Innovation   #### Driving mass adoption in China  *Before mass commercialization of blockchain can occur, current technologies and product offerings must reach a level of maturation, which reduces friction for onboarding new users. Reducing friction for end-users is a prerequisite.*  *Developers and companies should make it simple for the less technologically savvy portions of the population to purchase cryptocurrencies and use decentralized applications. Further, tokens need to be integrated into current traditional platforms to replace current offerings.*  *Kevin Fang, founder of VeChain, is integrating the company’s blockchain technology into the existing technology of the company’s enterprise partners. As a service, VeChain outsources provider solutions that are customized for specific industry-based pain points.*  *For example, VeChain offers traceability to Walmart China’s supply chain for food safety. To hammer home the point of interoperability, Fang said, “enterprise partners don’t care which chain they’ll use, or if it’s a public or private chain, they just care that a traceability solution will work.”*   [https://cryptobriefing.com/7-asian-blockchain-interoperability/](https://cryptobriefing.com/7-asian-blockchain-interoperability/)#**Today's Fun Fact**  There are now more than 20,000 VET addresses with more than 100,000 VET each.#2600 eco nodes live!

Even the Walmart spike day, which did break through, closed well below. Very simplified, that means that even on small uptrends, we have stayed below a medium-term average price.

Set each player’s hero as their selected neutral colors, and host dominion games within this testing ground period. Then, use your **BIG DATA** and community outreach to examine the amount of times teammates have been killed, or confused for an opponent. This might give your community some good insight into what you may be concerned about, *or* show you how this may represent a non-issue for your players.

Pssst, Ubisoft, read this!!!!#And lets call it Testing Grounds Phase Two: Civil War because of all the team killing that will definitively happen /s.#I thought about this quite literally a few moments ago.   It would be great if they used testing grounds for things other than just reworks#Golden idea dude!#Excellent idea#And also revert the colors to their original state#What can be changed within a character's moveset within a different game mode doesn't mean that a full on customization option can also be changed for 1 game mode. Color swatches are not private information. They are public customization option that can't be changed within a game mode. However, a moveset can easily be changed since during the foundation of the game, the Devs made the movesets dynamic to allow balance changes. However color swatches are related your account and cant be changed with a new mode.#You can't put color swatches into testing grounds since you customize your character before entering that mode, but I'd prefer UBI added all swatches for both defenders and attackers in main game for a limited period of time to see the community reaction. But they cant/wont do that, because if they decided to go back to seperated swatches afterwards, people who bought swatches in this limited period of time whould be displeased since most of people would buy swatches for team modes anyways.   It seems there are two options. Make all swatches for all game modes for good or make skins on client side, which seems a bad idea and way too different from current customization system to try and implement it.# Testing Grounds is like a event within the game, and seperate session, not a completely different client. You need a different client like they did for Marching Fire.

Have the locked up rewards been in custody?  Also they note not all rewards were locked up by the team (137M VET) in vol 7 of the report. They make no comment about what isn’t locked up outside of the executive team in previous financial reports. Could all be part of the ongoing sell pressure.#I'm also a little bit surprised we haven't seen this big testnet activity from a month ago come to fruition on the mainnet.#[deleted]#This buyback is shady as fuck.#OK this is happening IMO. Bonus wallet owned by the foundation is released on a quarterly basis. To prevent staff to „dump“ their owned (and well deserved) tokens on the market and make the price crash, foundation decided to implement a buyback program. What we currently see looks like a wash trading activity. High volume, price stable. In fact, it‘s just a way to switch accounts. Doing it on the open market (instead of OTC) might be due to some regulation topics. All good for me. At least „staff dumping their tokens“ is a non-fud this way.#Can't even imagine what the employees might feel like, they've probably worked their asses off for the last 2 years, collecting a fixed amount of VET as bonuses to now cash out when it's 96% down. I hope the moral didn't take a significant hit.#[removed]#I think (hope) they would have removed walmart china from the slides when they are not partners anymore!?#Vechain listed on Binance US...Is it just rumours or is it true??"

As we know there are 101 ANs and there was a ""contest"" to become one back in 2017.  But checking the blockchain we can see that , for example, this AN  [https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x9c3b425ae9909abb6ff0621d1f7dd2fbe57f73af/transactions](https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x9c3b425ae9909abb6ff0621d1f7dd2fbe57f73af/transactions)  Got enough VET 25M  just 2 months ago  And started signing blocks just 11 days ago  [https://explore.veforge.com/blocks?page=65&signer=0xa2591d83336ed2ff1cdbb0717b462c0149c36614](https://explore.veforge.com/blocks?page=65&signer=0xa2591d83336ed2ff1cdbb0717b462c0149c36614)  &#x200B   So we can see new players are coming into the game.#And one more thing. Sorry guise for taking over the daily.  I'll be keeping eye on this wallet who sold the vet  [https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x9902dcb39b92ca11b0b1445be0447c5bf7c6a28e](https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x9902dcb39b92ca11b0b1445be0447c5bf7c6a28e)  Watching what he does with other tokens like OCE, TIC, EHrT. If he sells them, I'll see that as just capitulation and moving out to cash.  But if that entity just sold the VET and Auth Node, I'll strongly believe he was \*forced\* to. Selling whole VET stack (right here, right now, before buyback)...ok, could be. Willingly giving up AN... I'm not buying into that. Smth is going on there.#OK so u/vx7777 excellent investigative work with the recent (super) dumping is thought provoking to say the least. This project has taken a beating price wise despite the fundamentals steadily improving which has prompted theories that range from possible to simply outlandish. Certainly those still here and holding are either going to be validated so greatly we will look like geniuses or this was a poor investment (crypto wise)in what looks like an up and coming successful company.  So with that said, maybe we can breakdown the negative and positive possibilities of the recent 100M+ dumping (and removal of an AN):  **NEGATIVE**   - Simple capitulation. Evidence: looking at the fucking price action.  - Insiders gaining knowledge about critical flaw or issue in project. Evidence: Nothing specific in the public other than perhaps the *relative* lack of good news/Medium articles from the project itself(which may be deliberate based on Jason Rockwood's recent tweets). Other evidence for this?  - Insiders gaining knowledge about an external threat to the project such as laws or regulations, perhaps within China. Evidence: incredibly slow development of crypto related regulations worldwide, China's absolute silence on the topic since banning exchanges in 2013, lack of listing on Coinbase (regulations/compliance in the US).  - AN entity (Enterprise? Single person? In between?) converted to another blockchain project. Evidence: none that I can produce other than not being able to specifically eliminate this as a possibility.  **POSITIVE**   - Removal of a bad actor. Evidence: basically all of u/vx7777's investigative work. Instant liquidation of AN. Sunny's odd tweet of gnome taking a dump (did I just type that?)?  - New strategic partner being introduced and added as AN. Evidence: this would rely on the fact that the AN dumped was owned by Vechain and a new one will or already has come on line. Again defer to vx7777's work here.  - Price suppression by smart money or bad actor or both (not necessarily positive in the immediate but in the long term it means whales know there's value to be had in controlling the price/accumulating). Evidence: Sell wall after sell wall after sell wall after sell wall after sell after...you get the point. Relative to the rest of the market and project's demonstrated fundamentals, price should not be doing worse than other alts, in a vacuum at least.   One other large consideration related to all of this that everyone is talking about is the buy back. 2ish weeks left in the month with another ~$3 million to buy. Vechain has to know their credibility to the retail market is on the line with this one given the announcement, details and public wallet address provided to the community. Possibilities:  - Buyback has been ongoing but not yet transferred to the wallet. Seemingly contradicted by the fact that brief spikes in the price on the exchanges have been linked to VET transfers to the wallet.  - Buyback will spend the remainder of the money in the next 2 weeks. Vechain has been on the up and up for the most part with the retail community so this would be a significant boost (or hit) to their credibility.  - Buyback will not spend the $5 million outlined for this quarter. This would be the first significant demerit I assign directly to the project. I would not sell but future buys would be halted with a wait and see approach.   Thoughts?#Hey guys. I wanted to structurize my own knowledge about current state of the vechain price and influencing factors.  I'll be analyzing those real reasons, not just giving sucked out of thumb predictions ""should be 1$ by Sept""  ).  As you should already know, not news and pahtnaships are moving the price, but buyers and sellers do, as I said numerous times here (and a lot of peeps are constantly being butthurt by that fact). What is really influencing the buying and selling power? So, let's go.  Positive and negative factor at the same time.  General altcoin market sentiment 5/5 is of the \*utmost importance\*. Negative short-term, positive long-term.  Vechain would have tripled or quadrupled in price on Walmart news in Dec2017/Jan2018, but in summer is retraced almost immediately after the news and went even lower. People were crying WHYYY, but there is nothing surprizing here. Market waves are more important than anything. Remember the AMZN and 100$=>6$=>2000$. A rising tide lifts all boats. But when everything is sinking, you're sinking with everyone else, nobody cares about ""good news"".  There is nothing certain in the market, but there is ultra high probability that altcoin market will bottom somewhere between here and BTC halving date. Even more probability to bottom between now and summer 2020 (after BTC halving), I'd give it 98% chance. Yes this is the accumulation range for the next rally. The bigger accumulation base will be built, the more sustainable the rally will be. For sure it won't be easy on your patience.  &#x200B   Positive factors:  Buyback 4/5. Real money. This is simple. Every dollar poured into buy&hold (and not speculate to sell higher) has big impact on the price. We just have to wait and see if the buyback goes as planned. The only downside to this factor is that it is short-lived.  Binance US potential listing 3/5. Not all americans will register back on Binance US, so the total userbase will definitely take a hit. Also we don't know when Vechain is going to be listed. But overall less listed coins = more money for each coin. And Vet has very good chance (please don't cry about ""security"" here, thanks. This is pay to play game)  OceanEx fiat gateway 2/5. This is long-long-term positive factor, but for now OcenEx doesn't have large userbase, so the impact won't bee too big for a time. For sure this is easier way for people to buy in and is scheduled to launch in Q4. Soon.  Bakkt potential listing 2/5. I'm giving this low rate because this is too uncertain factor. Bakkt is launching with BTC only for now, but as we know, they were researching into listing additional coins and even had a list that included vechain (and Verge lol, so they didn't made too in-depth research there. We can safely assume they will reassess the list). But if Vechain gets listed someday, it will be quite big. I think it \*could\* happen in 2020-2021.  Increasing transactions by Walmart or any other projects 2/5. This is good for sure, but too speculative for now. We have to wait and see.  &#x200B   Negative:  \-Salty bagholders 5/5 Well, this is main source of sell pressure. Lots of people jumped on coins in 2017 by pure gamble and moonboish narratives (100$ VEN soon). Capitulation is not a single point in time. This is a process. People bail out in waves. You can always check vechainstats to see the amount of people bailing out in the given moment of time. Judging by periodical whining there are still some left.  \-Binance US closure 4/5 This one is hard hit. US traders were at least 20% of Binance volume, maybe 30%+. Not all US holders bailed out, some just transferred to their wallets to hold, but many did. Good thing: this is almost entirely priced in already. As you can see)  \-Lack of transactions 3/5. Yes Vechain is ahead of most of crypto projects by a mile. But this isn't enough for economic model to start working properly. Potentially fundamentals are big (partnerships, projects), but currently this isn't enough. We need stable 1 million TX a day for eco model to properly kick in. Die-hard fundamentalists would rage that I hadn't given this 5/5 rating. Sorry guys, general market waves are way more important still.  \-Vechain ICOs sell pressure 3/5. I'll be brutally honest here. I don't think those projects are bringing a lot of value (won't call any names, but I mean.. most of them), but every time you're giving them money, they will sell the collected Vet on market, putting quite a bunch of sell pressure. I think any really worthy projects could pretend on VechanThorPower Fund to fund their activities. Yeah... there are more serious VCs sitting there, so you can't just suck money out of them on pure hype, they will screen you thorouglhy, not like retailers. Sorry guise if you were hurt by that truth.  \-Shady actors 2/5. Like the one who sold 100m Vet yesterday. Those are not pleasant, but they will be gone with time. Cream said he'll investigate on that matter)  Vechain employees 2/5. Yeah they get Vet as part of their salary and it isn't voluntarily locked as the executive teams Vet. Can't do anything about that, just a fact.  &#x200B   Conclusion and a dose of hopium: I must say, that's not a real bull market until previous ATH gets beaten. AMZN beaten its ATH in 8 years, BTC is taking 3 years on average. Fact. Inhale.  &#x200B   I'll update the post if I remember anything else.#[https://twitter.com/sunshinelu24/status/1172962696796528640](https://twitter.com/sunshinelu24/status/1172962696796528640)  Sunny said his word  "" I don’t know who it is.

I had to get a new phone yesterday.  My old phone (including my VeChainThor app) was deleted.  I just setup my new app/wallet with my mnemonic phrases, etc.  It says the setup was successful, but I don’t see any of my assets.  Everything is zeroed out.  Will it take a minute to update or am I SOL?  Thanks   UPDATE- I got it.  I remembered I wrote down a separate mnemonic phrase and it worked!  Thanks everyone.#How many people think that they’ll sell in 5 years when  Vechain has made it? Let’s say it reaches 25 cents. Most of us would be in good profit. Would you sell and move on?   Amazon in 2010 when it finally established itself after 15 years of grinding, was about.. $100. People that bought in 2001 at $10 thought “wow. I’ve 10x my investment, time for me to sell”. They did good, really good,   Ironically, that would have been the time to HODL because that’s when major hedge funds look at a money generating business, that’s a leader in the field, and buy for the long term. They look for sustained growth, and dividends.   Forward 10  years and Amazon hit a whopping $2000!!!   If Vechain reaches that threshold. Where it’s a tech and market leader by being the most used Blockchain, I would encourage everyone to hold on to your VET for dear life. Because that’s where the fun begins.   And as broke as some of us are because we’ve been investing non stop for the past 2 years, now and it seems like the near future is the time to buy. This is indeed blood. If you believe in Vechain, buy!   Cheers and good luck!#[deleted]#At this point, the only thing I believe is worth doing is holding vet and vtho. I don’t see any financial incentive to convert vtho back to vet at this point.#Guys don't worry about the buyback! We know they aren't amateurs and have plenty of funds available. It's an excellent strategy to wait until the end to do most of the buyback when the price keeps declining. They're aware of the price suppression, they're aware that people are worried. I presume the main goal of the buyback is to get as much VET off the market as possible. The best way to do this is to buy the majority at the lowest price before the end of the quarter. When do you think that is that when the price keep dropping?   It also doesn't make sense to believe that they've already purchased the VET but just haven't send it to the VeForge address. Why bother buying VET when you're not going to send it to the wallet for a while and you know the price will drop?   It all looks like this was the strategy from the beginning in case the price keeps dropping. To accumulate a small amount of vet every couple of weeks to let people know they're keeping their promise. And buy the majority at the end when the price is lowest.   There's no reason to believe they're not gonna come through with their promise. I believe buying the majority of the vet in a very short time frame will definitely push the price up. Which will keep old investors confident hodling and attract new investors.#VET/BTC seems to have very little volume on OceanEX. I've been waiting much longer than expected for my order to fill.#Here's an article that sheds some light on what Sunny means when he says ""let's not speculate, let's continue to build without being distracted"" (paraphrasing here, obviously).  [https://media.consensys.net/gartner-blockchain-will-deliver-3-1-trillion-dollars-in-value-by-2030-d32b79c4c560](https://media.consensys.net/gartner-blockchain-will-deliver-3-1-trillion-dollars-in-value-by-2030-d32b79c4c560)  The next couple of years are going to be very boring for those who spend their time looking at charts, worrying about the price, and coming up with all sorts of conspiracy theories that fit their worldviews. But they will be very exciting for anyone who can get passed the desire for instant gratification, and instead maturely embrace the patience and serenity that it takes to glide through this long journey.     Edit: Lol at the salty, overinvested downvoters.#What if VeChain found collusion / bad actors in the AN’s and has expelled them so they’re dumping?  That would actually be a positive as it would validate the Authority Node model and help Enterprises feel more secure about the project.#[removed]#Woke: The later the next bull run, the better. Still accumulating here. You guys should all be happy about this opportunity to DCA. I know it‘s worrying sometimes but I‘m actually laughing at these prices right now. I would have never thought to be able to double my stack one day.  Not so woke: Muh losing sats, I‘m down 90%. My life is shit. No more Oreos in the cupboard. Trump still president. One day I will die.#I've said it before, I dont give a *#!!/!  about the price right now. Its unbelievably pathetic yes how VET is where it is but I was just thinking the other day  some big name companies have seen value in what Vechain is doing. They have seen such potential that they are actually using the tech. We know the names.   In my mind Vechain is still easily in the top 5 projects that have the greatest chance to see success in blockchain, and as Walmart scale up their use, and the other various projects begin to come online, that chance of success is only becoming more obvious.#What do you guys think about the decreasing mainnet activity? The trend doesn't look too good imo. This week we burnt significantly less VTHO than the week before. I understand that the spike with 1 million daily clauses was data migration. But why is the activity constantly decreasing every week since then? Shouldn't we see increasing mainnet activity at this point? I mean groundwork is done, services are developed and can be used. Is it clients leaving or not using the blockchain as much as before? Maybe some companies tested Vechain and decided not to use it anymore?#The vaichain coin is in deep trouble and it's an issue that has to be addressed.#Hey Everyone. /biz/ contrarian here. Don't take this as FUD / Salt but seriously, do you despise money? Let me run the general bagholder consensus on this sub: Meh VET is a long term play. Don't expect any action pricewise in the next 2-3 years. Meh Adoption Adoption Adoption Adoption Adoption but don't expect any price change till we get network usage that justifes the VET/VTHOR demand price.  Retail bag holders account for less than 10% of the wallets.  Just Tether up if you're too deluded to think any other project can suceed.  You're guaranteed to lose sats for the next 36 months at least. Wake the fuck up. You've bought too early."

All citizens will participate in this ecosystem. There are 35,000 people in this small country. Every citizen has their own wallet. If the public has good behavior, they will be motivated, that is, if the citizens use shared travel instead of driving by themselves, they will be rewarded. If they act to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, save energy or save water, they can get rewards. This reward will be placed in the smart contract and will be verified by us, and the citizen will be able to enter the early ecosystem to get established. This token will be accepted by the government as a tax incentive, and citizens can use this reward to shop in the store. This is a very good opportunity for us to try out how this technology can create value for us in a small country. At the same time, we are able to ensure compliance with all existing regulatory requirements.""  BRUHHH. That is so damn awesome. Each citizen has a wallet and gets rewarded for carbon reduction behaviors. This is basically the pilot for countries with millions and maybe even billion+  ). Also we have <150k wallets right now lol we are damn early. 35,000 wallets from here and 900,000 customer wallets I mean damn we might have the largest active users/wallets real quick.

Their have their own agenda. I don’t expect to see vet there ever. Feel free to be unhappy.  Binance US is the answer. Even Bakkt is better chance. I guess they will be exploring new assets in 2020.#WHY IS EVERYONE DISCUSSING DEADLINES AND SPECULATE ABOUT POTENTIALLY NOT MEETING DEADLINES BEFORE THE DEADLINE?   Christ! That buyback discussion is totally annoying and currently it‘s just FUD. Until maybe after the deadline but first things first.  I mean: just fucking sell and stop whining here. We had one of the best infos for months yesterday with Deloitte and DNV GL and yet everyone is discussing buyback rubbish.#You guys had me thinking that we were at the end of September, whining about the buyback and such. You can see who actually has an interest in the project, vs those who just want to make some quick gains. The former would be talking about the amazing news yesterday, the latter would be complaining that their bags have not been pumped.#The buyback initiative is nothing more than a message to investors: Hey guys, we are so confident that we are willing to buy our own coins. So don't worry, we are still working hard and have every incentive to continue to do so, even in an extended crypto ""winter"".   That's it. Even Tron did this lol. It is completely inconsequential and does not merit any anxiety or doubt in VeChain at all. The foundation has met all its goals thus far and they continue to listen intently to the community, as they have from day 1. They will keep their promise just as they have before. They probably already bought the coins but will transfer them later to the public account.  I cannot believe people are losing their shit over this. Go do something meaningful with your time, guys.#Ok Ill just copy one of my comments here, since I see a lot of debate about the buyback, and expect it to heat up more as the deadline approaches. Just to be clear - this is not whining. I take things for facts as they come. Buyback deadline not met? Fine, Ill take it as a fact and make a decision moving forward. No biggie. But since I feel many are missing the point, I wanted to say this -   One of the features of blockchain is trust. Vechain is building a public blockchain. Therefore one of the core values of what they are building and offering revolves around trust. If you cannot trust what they say, its hard to trust anything that they attach their name to either. Yes this example is a bit extreme, and not meeting one deadline doesnt automatically invalidate everything you do, but still, trust is key.  Simply put, I dont want to guess whether or not what you say is true, based on the fact that in the past sometimes it was and sometimes it wasnt. I dont have time for guessing games. Businesses dont either. I want to believe that everything you say is true, based on the fact that in the past it always was. The moment I lose that certainty that I can trust you, and I have to guess and waste time and effort thinking about whether youre telling the truth or not, Id rather just not deal with you.#The clock is ticking, Mr. Lu.  Tick tock.#[deleted]#[removed]#Ok. So whatchu gon' do if buyback is incomplete?  Ask fo' refund?#[removed]#Is it not possible that the foundation is buying back the majority of coins OTC through the 1.5B fund that was just unlocked?  And perhaps they decided to buy enough on binance to keep the price from crashing but not more. Thoughts?#Quick question off topic.  I'm a new investor to VET and just signed up here. I where wondering if one also receive VTHO airdrops on Binance for holding VET? If so, on which dates?#[deleted]#All the people going “Wen buyback” make me laugh.  I didn’t invest in VEN/VET based on a buyback promise. I did it based on the fundamentals, which are stronger than ever. If the buyback quota is not met, big deal. Sell and leave. No one cares."

I am a little intrigued though by the adoption aspect, it seems this project has made some really interesting milestones (i've never held any btw, so this would be adding to my portfolio)#Take a break people. Enjoy the updates when they come. No point in lurking in the forums complaining about what’s not. Vechain is moving along at a good clip. As long as it doesn’t close up shop, we’ll be good in a few years.   Your times better spent creating wealth elsewhere for now. Hoard those assets. I’m out for a while. Peace!#Just some thoughts for beginning of 2020.  About a week ago Sunny Tweeted ""**Digital wallets for 900,000 customers by Jan 2020""**  The total VET supply is 86.7 Billion which generate 37.5 million VTHO per day.  (.000432 VTHO per VET)  Considering these 900,000 wallets only, added to the fact that each clauses cost about 47 VTHO to be written to the blockchain. Each wallet doing only one clause per day will burn the entire VTHO supply and then some. (900,000 \* 47 = **42.3 Million VTHO burned per day**) I believe due to the nature of supply and demand that price will really start to move upward once we continuously burn more VTHO than generated daily. VET tokens will have more value as they are the only thing that can create more VTHO.  YES this assumes each of the 900,000 wallets averages one transaction per day which does not seem to unreasonable. Maybe some do 0 while others do 10 or 20 a day.  NOW add in the 35 thousand citizens of San Marino, The thousands (maybe millions) of Chinese hopefully starting to use the Carbon Credit App that just launched, Walmart China's up ramp of products (hopefully), the BMW Verfycar platform (coming), Chinese Natural Gas, Australian Steaks, Italian Wine, and several other small and big partners coming in the future. How can you not believe in the future of VeChain and realize the next 2-3 years can be absolutely awesome with so much potential.   Just something to think about as we are in another big price slump and mood is not exactly positive right now. Keep your mind or big picture long term. Prices suck yea but I still want to buy more because I believe in the future.# m someone who has been reading and watching this Vechain group on and off for a few months, but has been hesitant to join.

Chinese insurers are more advanced than many overseas peers in providing services to customers through ecosystems. For instance, PICC Group, China’s largest property insurer, has established its online motor service unit Bang Bang Auto Service, with the goal of integrating online car retail, financing and after-sale services. *It has also established partnerships with DNV GL and VeChain to apply blockchain technology to reform its legacy claim management system, to enhance data management and processing.*#PLAIR Beta Mainnet is live!

Normally, we see numbers like '2' and '6' and if we are lucky, '25.'  Any VeChain detectives feel like doing some sleuthing?#[https://www.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/d85n0o/daily\_vechain\_discussion\_september\_23\_2019/f17dmk0/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/d85n0o/daily_vechain_discussion_september_23_2019/f17dmk0/)  Just as planned.  &#x200B   Guys, the buyback went not like many of us expected initially, but don't be fooled, what is going on is bullish. They eliminated their own sell pressure on the market, and that is, about 1 billion quarterly, which was sold before.  Basically they are now self-sufficient and don't rely on selling tokens straight on the market for development to keep going, unlike a lot other cryptoprojects that are forced to do so and risking to go bankrupt if the alt bear market will go on longer.  &#x200B   As I said before, supply question is solved for now (all those posts previously, ""where are those sell walls coming from? who's selling that low?"" - Occam's razor, guys. *Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem)*.  Now it is all about creating demand by making more txes on the blockchain.#Ok so any updates on this World Food Chain thing? Kinda confused about it would love some insight if anyone could explain.#When it comes to mainnet acitivty, would it be possible to see where the activity is coming from? Months ago we were getting hundreds of thousands of transactions but that quickly decreased. It makes me curious as to where the transactions came from as many of us assumed it was Walmart. Just my opinion but with blockchain being trustless and Vechain being transparent, these transactions should be identifiable.#Interesting, we haven’t gotten our typical transactions that come in the first couple of hours of a new day on veforge today#UPDATE on buyback progress ( [https://imgur.com/a/N6N4Yiv](https://imgur.com/a/N6N4Yiv) ). I added the deposits into the Foundation Buyback wallet that occurred over the weekend to the table I created previously.   I see a total of **$4.01 Million Spent which leaves $980,000 left** to be bought by the end of the day. At .0034 per VET this is another 288 Million to be bought to make the $5 Million for this quarter.   The prices were estimated but should still give a good idea of the buybuy progress. Price paid highlighted in grey is verified by the @BuyBackBot on Twitter.#This is a good day. I feel positive sentiment coming#>Another amazing night in Munich, time to go home.

So much potential.#Anyone have any idea how much vtho the foundation is generating per day with all there holdings?  I just calculated the buyback wallet with absolutely no node bonus and there generating 400,000+ vtho for themselves per day from that one alone.#So keeping conspiracies aside, I wanted to touch on the facts of the “financial” report.  “The information related to the buybacks will be disclosed in VeChain Financial Executive Report, starting from Report Vol.8.” Is the final sentence in the buyback medium.  They did not disclose any relevant financial information in the vol.8 report.     A financial report should have disclosed how much vet was bought, on what date and for what price. The buyback purchases should be charted. A real buyback would have this information on the books.  These financial reports aren’t actually financial reports. They do not give you numbers. They seem to be more of a team update if anything.  Does anyone else see the issue with this or is this just gonna be another thing intentionally over looked by the community?#13.37 m transfer   Leet speak.

When you see buy and sell orders in the 20-40M (!) range and everyone comes to the party at the same time, you can assume whale wars of course. I still think there‘s a chance the buyback program was partly put in place to allow team bonus to be sold without hurting the price.  Imagine if all team members would start selling their bonus from the last 2 years (not the C-level, the regular members), that would be a bigger disaster for the price development.

This product is finished and ready for usage.  The other company is building a more efficient and eco-friendly drill that can also be used in both geothermal wells and oil wells.

Give me a break.   I went back and reread the original buy back medium article. They never said they were buying vet on the open market... The article states “the VeChain Foundation recently announced a VET buyback plan worth up to $25 million. The first phase of the buyback, which amounts to no less than $5 million on the open market, will be implemented over the next quarter, starting in July 2019.”     It doesn’t actually say they will buy it on the open market.  They are calling it a buyback plan that will be worth up to 25$ million.   It says the first phase of the buyback will be implemented over the next quarter. It also says that the phase will amount to no less than 5$ million on the open market.   It seems clear that they transferred vet to Binance wallet then transferred it out to the buy back wallet.  Perhaps they are naming this fund the buyback plan and it is not technically a buyback plan as a ploy to dupe holders?  I understand vx’s post regarding the Vechain financial report. It definitely is positive that they are locking up funds that they would have otherwise sold without the buyback plan. But to imply that they were going to buy this vet off the open market is pretty low. We all thought the same thing when the buyback medium was posted.   “The information related to the buybacks will be disclosed in VeChain Financial Executive Report, starting from Report Vol.8.” Is the final sentence in the buyback medium.  They did not disclose any relevant information in the vol.8 report.   Am i the only one seeing this right now?#I’m so glad VeChain isn’t a Marvel movie in the making, because all of us detectives would’ve spoiled it, and then complained about how Marvel was letting us spoil their plot with our sleuthing.

This looks like a play here, price is being held like that usually smells distribution or accumulation. Based on the chart it looks like accumulation finally happening here with higher probability.

Seriously someone just listed a VeThor X Node for 5 Million Vet. Two other VeThor  X this morning were listed for 2 Million and 1 Million VET.  I have not seen any X Node sell for over 650,000 VET recently and personally I dont see the slightly extra VTHO generation being worth this much VET.  If you buy a VeThor X Node you still need 600,000 VET just to hold it.  Holding 600,000 VET and a VeThor X Node generates 36 VET (270 VTHO)  per day. At that rate it would take you 49 years to generate the 650,000 VET you paid for the node. If you paid 5 Million VET for your node, 380 years to generate it back at the current rate.  I understand they can have value in the future but that is still based solely on speculation. Even knowing you can buy a VeThor X and upgrade it through the ranks, these asking prices are getting insane.  EDIT: Someone actually bought a VeThor X for 890,000 VET 2 days ago. Given the current market how is this considered a smart investment?#Interesting how on there are little transactions on Oct 1 in the veforge explorer.

I have serious concerns about this in terms of VET price. They are creating enough vtho where companies and businesses can interact directly with the foundation to run their blockchain projects. Not to mention selling tokens to pay employees or for whatever they need Fiat for to run business operations. This goes directly against decentralization. I'm not spreading FUD. I'm just concerned.  Instead of down voting, how about a comment and a little back and forth"

I am unsure as i am somewhat new to the field myself. I go back and fourth between GitMeister/Server administrator and coding. I have the ""title"" of software engineer.   Do you create new SQL procedures for your system to make things work better or faster? That would probably classify as programming.#You are Data (Pipeline) Engineer#My title is ""Senior Programmer/Analyst."" It has been for 17 years.

By chance, is this a government or state job?  One of my friends from college wound up with a Software Engineer position with the government that was basically just a Business/Data Analyst position (lots of SQL creation and modification) that required some occasional script creation.#You engineer software.  Software is more than just front end or backend system code.  Maybe you are a Systems Engineer?

Shitty bootcamps taking over the world confirmed.#Thousands of Software Engineers don't write much if any code. This reddit HATES that fact though, and likes to insist that CS *by definition* means programming, despite literally decades of evidence to the contrary. ""Software Engineer"" is a made up term by non-engineers to mean computer professionals. It can mean dozens of different subsets of CS, including programming. Lots of SQA people are called ""Software Engineers"" (or ""Software Quality Engineers""). Big Data guys are called software engineers even though they rarely if ever program. You have to remember that most of these titles are completely meaningless and made up. There's literally no such thing as a real software engineer. You will find ZERO ""software engineers"" who are P.E.'s (Professional Engineers). Use whatever title you think will help you get your next job#you sound like a data analyst more than a SWE, but the title really doesn't matter, does it?#where can i get a job like this? i prefer this over writing code#Know of any similar positions in Philly?#So many people saying the title doesn't matter, and as an individual I would agree that it does not. But what happens when OP looks for a job that suits his experience (Data Analyst experience) however the HR person flipping through resumes doesn't see ""Data Analyst"" on his/her resume and instead sees ""Software Engineer""?   Often times it is HR doing the initial filtering, and you can bet they don't read the bullet points. They read the job titles to match to the job description requirement, for example: ""5+ years of data analyst experience""#well SQL is code to me, and some problems are even more interesting than mainstream application code :)#I do the same thing as you and my job title is Data Architect/Scientist. I write a bit of sql, python and java at work. Most is for data flows or transformations. However, most of my time at work is spent doing implementions/tests/NiFi workflows/analyzing data. If I write code, it's mostly to make my life a bit easier or make the environment more maintainable. Such as writing storm toplogies to dynamically replace data based on a key value in a database rather than hardcoding a replace statement.  I write code mostly in my free time on OS projects such as lucene or NiFi.#if it fits on a spreadsheet, it ain't big data#I think your correct title is either Database Developer, borderline Data Engineer (if you mentioned using more python I'd call you a Data Engineer). They covered their rear ends by hiring a full SWE to do the job.#I work with SQL and also customize existing java code and write little pieces to build small elements on top of the core software . However, I have never had to create code from scratch. For example, I never have to declare any variables. They are all pre-made by 'higher' engineers. I can only reference them within the confines of what the engineers have have deemed safe for customization.#People over-index on titles.#I've learned to shrug off titles unless I find them detrimental to future resumes. *A rose by any other name...*#Everyone here saying that data analyst might be a better title fit, but unless you're actually pulling and analyzing said data, sounds more like a Data Warehouse Manager position.#BI Developer, not Software Engineer#Well today I wrote 15 lines if we include CSS, then I was in meeting or trolled in blind and reddit so...   But I am getting a 15% raise this month anyway :D#Unfortunately this is quite common in the bigger companies. I know many instances where Senior Software Engineers don't write any code on a day to day basis, just some occasionally. Mostly code reviews, tech planning, designs and other meetings.  Your case is slightly different, it looks like you're a Data Engineer/BI Engineer.#My official title is Software Engineer but I am really at database developer or engineer. I write code all day long. It’s mostly SQL. I know some don’t consider SQL “coding” but we all know that bullshit.#If this is BigCo in that area, i know the company and I only mention this because it was fairly obvious.  Edit: Even worse I just checked your third post and it is the same company. Delete this or make it a lot less obvious.  Edit 2: Just read through your comments on this post and it definitely is.

I recently accumulated enough VET for a strength node. I will wait the 10 day maturity period, but I have a question for what to do afterwards.  I can simply press upgrade to a Strength Node and I am enrolled for the rewards? What if I wanted to sell some VET (I am a long-term holder. Just want to clarify.)? Then will my node automatically go away? I don't know much about this so I just want to ensure my VET won't disappear randomly.  Also... I think I read somewhere that the rewards you have to collect manually. If that is the case, can I collect over a long period of time? Let's say I go 1 month without collecting anything. Then will all the VTHO accumulate for the month and I could claim it in full?  I tried to do the proper research, but I am still a little bit confused. Thank you for all the help.#Hi!

While selling and buying at the same time sounds counterintuitive for ordinary person, it makes a lot of sense from company perspective.  Spending from ""operational and development fund"" **was planned since ages ago**. Audited and approved. It will continue to go on for a while, until this pool is depleted.  &#x200B   Basically, where the supply comes from in crypto? In BTC and ETH ecosystem it is miners mining new blocks, getting rewards and selling that on market.  In case of Vet it is foundation selling premined Vet to fund ongoing operations, research and so on.  Btc inflation rate is 3.73% yearly now, ETH is about 4.4%  Why BTC shoots up every time during the halving event? Because basically **inflation rate is cut in half thus limiting the future supply**.  (sidenote: that's why Algorand and Hashgraph are going through the floor, their inflation rate is insane,50%+, Zcash: 34%)  &#x200B   When foundation sold about 1 billion Vet per quarter, it was generating approximately 1\*4/62\*100 = **6.4% yearly inflation**, (where 62 bil is approximate circulating supply)  &#x200B   **Supply and demand dynamics is key for the price**  With the help of buyback program, effective current **inflation should become about zero, at least for the year**.  **I think of that as very positive and bullish sign from now on.**#>Just want to emphasize how legitimate and credible VeChain now is - Board of Directors for trusted blockchains in China with the big boys, Alibaba, Huawei, Tencent, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange 😳 VeChain must be doing something right!  https://twitter.com/BenYorke/status/1177635369166073858#“Top of the list” of “The Board of Directors”. I’m sorry whattttttttttttttt!!!!   Are we witnessing the birth of the next:   SoftBank: https://youtu.be/YgkQdUB0JVQ  Tencent: https://youtu.be/m5yFhJFqw5w  Alibaba: https://youtu.be/gk69hV6LEgI  ?  ?   ?#The VeChain Executive Financial Report vol.8, which covers the period of May 2019 to July 2019, is now available!  https://medium.com/vechain-foundation/vechain-financial-executive-report-vol-8-f9a8ef88b5d9#> Announcing Beta Mainnet Launch!  [https://medium.com/plairlife/announcing-beta-mainnet-launch-1a608d3e8b14](https://medium.com/plairlife/announcing-beta-mainnet-launch-1a608d3e8b14)#Now, when I've talked a little bit about supply question, there is the other one important: demand  &#x200B   Where the demand for BTC came from? Initially, it came from... yeah, black markets. You know, Silk Road and so on.  BTC had important qualities: anonymous, transparent, fast, non-repudiable, high portability  This where the organic demand came from. When it started gaining value, speculators kicked in.  Spectacular rise, crash in 2013, then finding a bottom. Every speculation comes back from where is started until there is a real demand for an asset.  You know, Bitconnect spiked and then crashed and never recovered, because there was nothing except speculative demand.  In 2015-2016 Bitcoin found the bottom and started rising when organic demand  (store of value for people whose currencies are overinflating like Argentinian, so on) for BTC started outweighing the supply. Then another speculative bubble kicked in 2017. Now BTC is again trying to find that organic demand and is doing pretty well.  I won't talk long about ETH story, but basically the demand for ETH came from when ICO funding started to gain interest and traction as new technology, smart contracts, so on...  &#x200B   Now, where the organic demand for Vet should come from. This is pretty simple - demand for VET comes from demand for VTHO. And demand for VTHO comes from transactions on mainnet. So key here is big dapps running on vechain thor. Getting as much VTHO burned as being generated. Then simple laws on supply-demand kicks in. **Speculating on future usage is fun, but you can live on news and partnerships for that long, in the end, we need that real usage**. As we know, team is working hard on that, so we wait for that to happen. When? Who knows. Then, speculative demand will follow again... and you know how hard speculative demand kicks in in crypto. Stay tuned.#starting to put more weight on the ""we're (too) early"" sentiment as a reason for why we don't see major buying pressure from big $$$ players, even though we know that plenty of people with resources have knowledge of this project and the potential.  they calculated the timeline better and realize there's still a lot of VET to be released (downward pressure on price) and time before mainnet buildup (slow tokenomics) so their money is better parked somewhere else for now.   there's also considerable chance of capital loss in the short to medium term (overall market and VeChain) even if it seems like such a sure thing to those of us who believe strongly in the project.  focus on Medium articles and the partnership network, not the price. soon enough though.#I'm in a super good mood today and just want to pass it on. I know these are rough times, but I will do my part in lifting the price today, just to all make you feel better. Now, I don't know how big that 60k VET will impact the market, but I'm already preparing an email to announce to CMC that they should reduce the circulating supply by another 60k. VET by VET the supply will dry up, just you watch  )#Just did a quick analysis of the buyback progress (LINK BELOW). I only considered the transactions of 1 Million VET or more into the buyback wallet. There are some very small deposits left out. This table includes 700 Million worth of deposits. The Price Paid highlighted in grey is verified by the @BuyBackBot twitter.  Price End of Day (EOD) was sourced from Coin Geicko  and is a good estimate of what the foundation paid during each transaction on the given date.  I see a total of **$2.9 Million spent so far out of the $5 million** outlined by the foundation. If these numbers are remotely correct we still need to purchase about $2 million worth of VET by Monday.  That is about another 600 Million VET tokens @ $0.0033 each.  Second verification to this is using the avg price paid $0.004195 (highlighted in blue) \* the 700 Million VET currently in the wallet is about $2.9 Million dollars spent so far.  Which agrees with the summation of the $ per transaction above.  Thoughts? I looked at this for a while and believe it to be correct. Could be an interesting next 3 days. Idk.

I know it's not much, but its something.#Can someone knowledgeable explain - will the funding of Foundation's operational costs by selling VET on the open market continue ""forever""?  Or there are some exact timeframes/limitations? Will this supply dry up with time?  Do we know how much Foundation is selling in terms of VET/month or USD/month?#edit: Removed as I'm a complete idiot :)#Is anybody keeping track of the $$ amount spent on the buyback so far? I know the foundation is supposed to buy $5Million worth by the end of the quarter.  As of now the wallet has 700Million VET valued at $2.3 Million.   On July 1st the VET price was  $0.0081 and now it is $0.0032. This is a big range to be buying at through the quarter. The average price though the quarter would be $0.0056. If we assume it was all bought at avg price then $5million would buy 884 Million VET. However, I know the foundation has added alot in the last week at a cheaper price, meaning more bought below average price.   Anyway seems we maybe close to $5million spent this quarter. Just trying to see if anyone has more exact number.   I guess if I really wanted to I can go line by line on the deposits to the Buyback wallet and calculate price depending on amount bought and the date it was bought. Then just added them all up to get a total $$$ value spent this quarter. I have a feeling we are at or very close to the $5million being all spent.#This just isn't a bull run at all.#[deleted]#I'm so intrigued as to where we are going with this project in 24 months.

Feel bad for everyone who bought into the X Node program. It's been an utter failure. Hope things turn around soon.#I am seeing VET+ in my Vault when accessing through Ledger.

You won’t ever see carbon credits it in your wallet like other tokens. The platform is live"".  I'd like to continue that discussion here. I actually thought we would see them in the wallet. If not, what do you mean by the platform is live? How will it burn VTHO then? As far as I recall in the recent medium about the Wechat app going live, they said they're doing 1 blockchain based token and 1 non blockchain based one for easier onboarding.#Reading BYD developments make my spidey senses tingle# [https://twitter.com/crypto\_savage69/status/1174887343435550720](https://twitter.com/crypto_savage69/status/1174887343435550720)  Did that go unnoticed? Binance to launch Fiat-to-Crypto OTC for Chinese Yuan in October  ""According to the CMO, Binance’s new OTC onramp is scheduled to launch next month and only targets the Chinese market, as the current plan envisions supporting the Chinese renminbi only, a Binance spokesperson said.""  ""OTC trades have largely become the principal method to buy Bitcoin with fiat money in China, with local investors purchasing stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) via OTC and converting them to other crypto. ""  Maybe this could help a lot of Chinese investors to have more easy access to good Chinese coins (along with BTC)?  Sounds pretty big fundamental factor as for me.#This week there is a United Nations summit on climate change in NYC.

In modern society much positive behaviour goes without reward or incentive. If you provide greater reward and incentive to those individuals who positively contribute to society then the results will be more people contributing positively in variety of innovative ways to create a better world. Why just reward low carbon lifestyles when you could also reward those volunteers, carers, innovators, bloggers, educators, coaches, etc in a similar ecosystem.

I also remember that brutal sell-off as the event was nearing its end with no announcement in sight. I believe it was something like - 20% in a matter of minutes.  Then, right before the end, Sunny said the rumors were true and the whole sell-off was bought back in seconds, leaving burned non believers behind.  I imagine something similar might happen next week as the buyback clock starts ticking its last hours and minutes. They did it once. They might do it twice.

So with TicTalk are we really thinking it is going to be left to die? or is something coming?#Just read an article about footwear company New  Balance doing a pilot project using Cardano to authenticate products. Its encouraging to know that more and more companies are investigating blockchain to trace the origins of products.   Wasnt even aware that Cardano offered that as a service to trace authenticity like Vechain, but it seems the demand is certainly growing in this area. Surely Vechain's solution would be far superior to what they are offering, a large part I guess comes down to project visibility to source a solution.

I don’t really care what happens now because I know the future is bright.   I just came back from a long trip in SEA and one of the first things that I read in my own bed was Spencer Dinwiddie of the Brooklyn nets is tokenizing his assets. His earnings basically. I couldn’t dig too much into it because I have a lot of paper work to catch up on but I bring this up because Spencer and Sunny Lu both follow each other. Or have in the past.   What this means in short is if this is related to VeChain at all, we are going to get tons of publicity in all age groups.   The NBA is huge and is basically the story line of 3-5 major networks for the next 6 months.   The NBA isn’t allowing Spencer to do this but don’t for one minute think he isn’t talking to the players union and other players alike.   TL DR   Huge NBA fan,  read that a professional player from the Brooklyn Nets wants to tokenize his earnings. Sunny Lu and Spencer Dinwiddie follow/followed each other on Twitter.#An interesting perspective on ranking Cryptocurrencies [here](https://wisecryptos.com/wise-crypto-ratings/)  Not reading too much into it but I was just interested to see a ranking system independent of price.

We're still far away from the 5M dollars though.#Had some real positive dreams last night... I just have to say: we’ve been hearing a huge amount about how TA has us setting up to bleed hard. Newtons law is for every shitty TA there is an equal and opposite shitty TA. They were saying the same at $3xxxBTC. My smartass friend was saying buying $3k BTC was foolish since TA was set to drop lower and if you don’t follow TA you shouldn’t be in this market at all. But you gotta trust your gut because TA is too either/or. That’s what I did buying $3-$4k BTC. Got the same feeling now. BTC was $8k ahead of the BAKKT announcement. A correction was expected. Not saying null run 2019 but I don’t think we’ll be in bear market all year

Frank Yiannas, former Walmart VP for Food Safety and a strong convert on the use of blockchain for supply chain tracking for food safety ([https://www.computerworld.com/article/3309656/qa-walmarts-frank-yiannas-on-the-use-of-blockchain-for-food-safety.html](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3309656/qa-walmarts-frank-yiannas-on-the-use-of-blockchain-for-food-safety.html)) became the US Food and Drug Administration's Deputy Commissioner in charge of food safety late last year ( [https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/frank-yiannas](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/frank-yiannas)).

wallstreetbets;d7y002;1569193441.0;/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d7y002/conspiracy_theory_time/;Conspiracy theory time;Okay so over the weekend I stole some adderall from my little sister and decided to read Flash boys by Michael Lewis. If you haven’t read the book, it’s all about the flash crash of 2010 when a bunch of high frequency traders algorithms stacked on top of each other causing the market to bend over and grab its ankles for 36 minutes before regaining most of the losses moments after. Queue spooky music Fast forward to 2019 we are in arguably the longest bull run in history (can’t emphasize arguably enough) where data is the new oil and everyone is willing to give up there data to dodge commission fees. This big data is thrown into a super computer with crazy algorithms and data sets that can recognize patterns and trends 100000x better than the average autist can. This big data has never been more accessible and has to be effecting the market in some way, and I think it’s effecting it a lot more than other autists believe..;Sir, this is a WeWork office space.#No conspiracy this is real.#Think about how accessible the markets were to the average person only 10 years ago compared to where they are today.  Robinhood, M1Finance, other commission free trading platforms are allowing anybody to throw a few dollars into the market and getting them hooked.  It is drawing in people who would otherwise be blowing these dollars at a casino because they are gamblers not investors.   People who have been mastering the markets and adapting to the way they evolve for generations are no doubt doing the same today, and figuring out the most effective ways to separate this new type of investor from their money.  Only now, they are more empowered than ever due to the advanced algorithms and technologies that they employ to do their bidding.#In other words, HFT? where is the conspiracy?#Conspiracy theory without a conspiracy... Infact there's no theory here#Thanks op, bought 100x supercomputers.#I would agree, except I think you're conflating algorithmic trading with HFT.  HFT algo's don't exactly play the long game.  To quote Matt Hurd:  > don’t worry about the next tick. Encourage market structures that are competitive, fair, and cheap. Then you can stand back and watch with glee why those HFT firms kill each other fighting for the lowest spread. This enables their liquidity to serve you, despite their motivations. After all, only buying higher and selling lower (i.e. narrowing the real spread) works to compete for the next tick. That is not a recipe for easy HFT money.   He points out that most HFTs are trading thousands of times per day, often only for the next tick.  They aren't concerned about how the stock is moving, only the micro of it.  Asset managers have way more say in how the stock market moves.  A better explanation would be the rise of ETFs like Vanguard who control billions in assets when people invest in them.  They have to purchase multiple stocks at the same time for something like the $SPY, stocks that the average user wouldn't normally purchase.  Along with QE at the beginning of this, along with how long the bull run has been going (since the market doing well gets more people to invest in it), it provides a better theory for the massive bull run.#You forgot the punchline...#what the fuck is the conspiracy? you just went on a meth rant without ever stating your point#This is a new low point for this sub.#Did you ever wonder how Robinhood exists? Payment for oder flow my dude. Right to the quants#there is supposed to be a movie or series on this in netflix, wish it would come out already...#Maybe the effect it has is a never ending bull run? I mean you could build like an overseer algorithm that keeps the charts going up, if it controls enough capital.#Ngl I always thought Flash Boys was about gay college dudes#So much data, all of these numbers what do they mean?   707 707 707 5318008#Flash boys didn’t really age well.#where is the conspiracy i already knew all this shit#That's why I reset my limit sell order for 420 shares of AMD always @$6969.35... daily.#This ain't no conspiracy nibba, this is da truff.#Ah you think this is a conspiracy, yeah the autism runs deep, you belong here.#Affect=verb  Effect=noun

Unfortunately, it's not my own or else the whole place would be a YangGang paradise. In addition, the owners are Trump supporters (one is apolitical, and the other is an unreasonable person), so I can't do much with the decor. I have been talking to my customers/patients about Andrew Yang. What I have noticed is that when I talk to them about Amazon, automation, or tech data, I don't get a strong reaction. However, when I start talking about how pharmaceutical companies are using their data to:1. Know which drugs to make (if more patients have heart disease then research heart disease drugs)2. Know where to sell their drugs(concentrate heart disease drugs in a population where heart diseases persist)3. Know where to push their sales team (the adjacent hospital is a surgical one, so I get a lot of sales rep for pain meds)When I tell them that their data is being sold to and used by big pharma to make millions of dollars and they get nothing in return, that's when they start to get it. That's when I finish them off with a Fatality. Jk, I introduce the FD. Many have asked who is this guy again? Can you write down the name for me? Of course, the talking points for the FD also helps, but the points about Big Pharma and Big Data reinforces the FD. If you plan to use this method, please remember to include that the FD will stack on top of their social security benefits.I hope this helps! Someone here also mentioned you can call (877)926-4202 to listen to Yang's DNC speech. I have modded the business card template to include that number to make Andrew Yang accessible to patients who are not tech-savvy.";Please remember we are here as a representation of Andrew Yang.

Thanks!  you are awesome!#Also, data as a property right is on his platform. Which means that your information should not be given to anyone without your consent and you should know who is making rent by selling derived data from it or mining it over time.  Yang’s proposals include expanding Medicare and putting a stop on outrageous healthcare and pharmaceutical costs by benchmarking costs of care against other countries. Because we don’t have a healthcare system designed to lower costs for anyone for its companies we will have to force American companies to compete where other countries solved it. There is hardly any innovation happening in routine, basic procedures fixing a broken arm or ambulance visit since 1965 but costs have skyrocketed for decades. Other countries may have private insurance options that are affordable because the public option most people take is able to negotiate effectively.  No other candidate is able to handle this kind of a complex reality now with their proposals. All their proposals are decades behind the reality of tech companies or healthcare companies looking for their next massive revenue generators.
cscareerquestions;d7evgp;1569093458.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d7evgp/got_offerred_an_internship_at_the_nsa_and_curious/;Got offerred an internship at the NSA and curious about how pursuing it would model my career.;[deleted];[deleted]#Accept it but keep applying in case your background doesn't complete. I would not consider a conditional to withhold you from continuing to look in case it doesn't work out. The worst thing would be that it doesn't work out and you have no internship next summer.#TS/SCI, especially in the DC area, is worth some serious extra money if you end up going civilian contractor.  Coming from the NSA is another feather in your cap with a number of employers who are doing work there anyway.  I have no idea what you're talking about with the reputation of NSA folks.  I hired dozens when I worked in the area and was never anything less than happy with their skills - like Defcon/Derbycon headliner level of smarts.  I think you'd be pleasantly surprised (and challenged) by some of your peers.  Don't stress over not being able to speak to what you were doing.  Stick to the tech aspects of it, leave the details of how it was being used out.#ts/sci with full scope poly is the real gold ticket#lol Microsoft and Amazon are both looking for tons of TS/Poly cleared individuals to join their team. You can definitely have a huge advantage over others when it comes to applying to jobs at commercial companies around the DC area.   Also 80k is pretty standard for most new grads in the DC area.#NSA == Poor Talent == Does Not Compute. Who told you this? If anything, your time at the NSA would catapult you to the front of the line for any position requiring a cybersecurity skillset, etc., so to me, the decision comes down to this: What do you want to do?#Please realize 80k out of college put you in the ~94th percentile for earners your age. I get its low relative to salaries for Bay area companies or seattle, but people live in DC with way less, so put it in perspective.#I have worked as defense contractor and done a lot of private sector work.  It all depends on your life goals.  If you want to earn above 250k, then the only way is to go to the Bay area or Seattle and maybe NYC and work for a big private company.  If your okay making less money, with older technology but very relaxed and easy work and environment then maybe defense is for you.  I would recommend when you are young to try the Bay area if that interests you.  As far as the internship goes, feel free to take it, private sector companies will like that your tried defense and can say the pros and cons.  You will be able to talk about the work you did at a high level, just not details especially about the data.  I have worked with a lot of really smart people in the defense space.  As other said, clearances are gold in the DC area, when I was there, I would get 5 offers in a week once I decided to look.  A lot of the jobs aren't good tho, so you gotta be careful.  Also Amazon is always desperate for devs with clearance, and then you can transfer once your in to a more enjoyable project if you don't like it.  With Amazon coming to DC the dynamics in the area could change.    Remember it's just an internship, it's not going to make or break your career either way.  Any internship is better than no internship.  Learn as much as you can, talk to people, ask them what is good and bad.  It's all about learning.#Accept it. Who knows, maybe one day you'll sell a book :) https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1174105969179189251#An internship is better than not an internship but you will have a much more lucrative career in private sector. You’ll probably have some very interesting problems to work on with a wide range of low to high skilled coworkers that aren’t that motivated to perform well. So is it best for someone looking for mentoring? Maybe not maybe so, depends. Is working there anything like working at any modern tech company? No.  But the clearance could get you in to some tech companies doing work with the federal government so that could help.   Take it if you don’t have a better offer but I wouldn’t look to transition to full time. Their goal (and all federal government) is to capture graduates into jobs and then keep them there because they can’t actually compete for experienced people with their salary/benefits. That isn’t a joke, that was paraphrased from someone at a three letter in charge of hiring when asked how they compete with private sector about two months ago at a conference.#Having security clearance is a plus for many jobs that work with the government. Especially military, cyber security, etc...#Did you pass/take the polygraph test already? I had a “conditional” offer for this high school senior program many years back, and couldn’t pass the polygraph for the life of me while telling the truth for whatever reason.  The tester kept nudging me to confess to stuff I’ve never done (illegal drugs or committing a crime), but at the end of the day, the HR lady said that most people don’t pass on their first time. Thus, because the pay was good for a 17 year old, I decided to make the trek back to Fort Meade a second time, where my new polygraph tester said all my responses were spiking, signifying I was harboring some deep dark secret (as a minor). At that point, working there just seemed like too much of a hassle for me, and given that I had nothing to confess, I told the dude just to let me leave rip.  Long story short, know that there is a chance you might not pass the polygraph tests, so like other commenters, I’d suggest continuing to look for other positions too.#A clearance is a golden ticket. Plus, Howard county is awesome#Doing IT for the government was one of the most boring jobs I've ever had.  Literally not a single motivated person.  Tread with caution.#I wouldn’t accept it. I got offered a NSA co-op my freshmen year and In retrospect I’m very grateful that I didn’t take that offer.  The co-op was essentially something like.. every other semester I would go work for 15/hr which is really shitty for a software engineering co-op. Don’t let others tell you that you’re making in the top X percentage compared to people your age. Don’t fall into that trap.   Secondly and most importantly... people don’t realize this but as you pick up “job experience” you begin to pigeonhole yourself to certain types of jobs and that’s up to you if you want to work for the DoD or related contracting work for the rest of your life.  Just FYI how it turned out for me.. I now work at a top tech company making pretty close to 200k a year and I just graduated college this may.   You have to think about the long game and how you compare to people your age who are also just graduating and getting software dev jobs.  Lastly, top companies have been poaching top talent from the government and universities for years! If you want to work at a place filled with passionate, driven, and talented people choose your work place wisely.#[deleted]#I like how people here refuse to work for Palantir on ethical grounds, but NSA is considered perfectly fine lol

cmu;dbzigm;1569962639.0;/r/cmu/comments/dbzigm/an_unpopular_opinion_calling_palantirs_oncampus/;An unpopular opinion: calling Palantir's on-campus recruitment activities to end at Carnegie Mellon is wrong;For those who don't know, Palantir Technologies is a private American software company that specializes in big data analytics.^(1) Palantir's controversy emerged as reports alleged discovered Palantir was working with the US government, specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), to produce analytics software used in deportations.Outcry over Palantir's involvement has resulted in a number of college campuses withdrawing their agreements with Palantir to recruit students during on-campus events.I have recently read multiple social posts calling for Carnegie Mellon to end its involvement with Palantir.I believe this is a well-intended argument. But Palantir is absolutely not the only company guilty of using its technology for morally-gray purposes, and is therefore undeserving of the particular derision it has gained.If Palantir contradicts CMU's open inclusion initiatives by cooperating with ICE, then Facebook and Google should similarly be banned from career fairs given its involvement with American (and foreign) surveillance programs challenges CMU's commitment to freedom of expression as an academic institution.By similar logic, Apple's role in the toxic extraction of rare-earth metals for its devices, which are heavily non-reusable themselves, is also deserving of scrutiny and exile from campus.I have not even mentioned the defense companies and agencies that frequent the TOC.I am not arguing that Palantir is not at least indirectly complicit in questionable government-related activities. However:**TL DR:** If a company's mission does not appeal to the campus community, then it would suffice for the student to decide for herself. This quasi-moral elitism is ultimately unproductive and is nearsighted when the technology industry collectively shares far greater sins.*This is a throwaway account*1. *Wikipedia*;Your post is a textbook example of [whataboutism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism) Solid work. If people want to express their disagreement with CMU allowing Apple or tech companies involved in defense contracts to recruit on campus, then they should be allowed to do that also. They're NOT obligated to take a moral stance on every possible controversial issue in order to express their views on a particular one that they care about. Stop gatekeeping.  Not only is it not *wrong* (whatever the fuck that means - not really sure how expressing an opinion with sound moral foundations is wrong), but students' ability and willingness to challenge institutional support (even if said support is only tacit) of entities they feel don't align with the university's stated values and their own values is critical to maintaining a spirit of intellectual freedom on campus, and also aligns with higher-level democratic ideals.  What IS wrong is implying that students should remain silent because you personally disagree with them, and then using a slew of logical fallacies to support your shit argument.  As an alumnus, this post is incredibly embarrassing to read.#Hey, I work for Facebook, and used to work for Google.  In both cases, if the government shows up with a legitimate warrant, they get the data they requested, which seems sane to me.  I don't know of any cooperation beyond that, and that seems pretty darn reasonable to me.  What am I missing?#There is nothing morally gray about Palantir.

Is it recommendable learning computer science *and* Sociology?;Title. If any of you guys know about it please tell me, I am still an undergrad and would like to learn more uses of the discipline.;"I double majored in sociology and computer science, yes this is possible. You can use the theory and statistical analysis techniques you learn from your soc classes to analyze the data you collect in CS. You would need to take a lot more classes but you can certainly do this. Also, there are programs that already exist that do this sort of hybrid study and I would recommend looking into that route rather than gluing together a degree like I did.#I'm guessing you've read Savage and Burrows ""The Coming Crisis of Empirical Sociology"", but in case you haven't it deals with the problems sociology faces by not having access to corporate big data sets. The great British class survey has also been framed as an (in my opinion completely unconvincing) response to this, so it might be worth reading about#Check out the new annual review of sociology piece on machine learning in sociology. If that tickles your fancy then itd be a great path! However, there's a LOT of CS that's going to be completely irrelevant for you.#Human Computer Interaction is a nice avenue if you want to combine the two. It's what I'm trying to do!#Super helpful if you know both. A lot of research in sociology requires a strong statistics background, and knowing SPSS, python, and R should give you a huge leg up. :)#In general, in my grad school, those that came into the program wanting to do big data or stats heavy work (and actually did it) came in having a really strong base in the stats, programming, etc. There was one exception (a theater major who got into big educational datasets) but it was a rare exception. That’s not to say they knew everything—all those kids took more advanced math/stats/data analysis classes in grad school, too—but they had knew a lot coming in.#Is anyone have a idea where can i start ""big data""? Videos, books, etc#okay I'm like 17 so probably not very educated on the matter but in my opinion you can literally mix sociology with anything. It's still a very young science and it's longing for new ways of working, so I'd strongly encourage you to go for ""your"" way of mixing these if you believe they're consistent. I'd myself love to work as a sociologist later and I'd be glad to work with modern ways of research. If you feel inspired to create something new than definitely go for it, we need these kinds of innovations !#I am currently getting a MBA in data analytics after a Sociology undergrad. Current company needs managers to have Masters degrees. I want to make more money and love stats. Its a win for me. Coding is stronglt recommended but only one leg of the ""Big Data"" triangle. Research big data more and find what you want to do within big data and go from there. It helps if you jave a set goal or job and how to get there in mind. (I dont have to learn coding. I wanna be the person who comes up with the rules and has someone code them to get the data we are actually looking for)#Yes if u want to crunch data @ scale#I think it's a nice idea. Aside from the - now probably dying Digital Methods - it's good to have ways to analyse and gather data. You can do your own models way more easily than somebody who doesn't know how to use a computer, and if you are a hard coder it opens up lots of experimental approaches - both ""virtual"" (online bound) and ""digital"" (intertwining IRL and offline).  Also: big data, computational sociology, human-computer interaction. And machine learning: automated content analysis, textual analysis, image classifiers and so on, are all pretty cool.  Work-related, knowing coding and QN methods opens many doors.  Bonus: if you are in certain institutions and thinking about academia, being the only sociology person with a CS background opens lots of doors, people will follow you at home to get help, offering co.autorship (never hurts).#I talked to one professor who received his PhD in immunology/biology and then got his post doc and professorship in psychology and his advice (that he received from someone with a similar track) was to develop expertise or get your PhD in one field, and then apply it and get your professorship in something else. That way, you have your niche, and you are the person that everyone looks to if they need advice or insights on that niche. Thought it was an interesting thought (even if it’s easier said than done probably)"

analytics;d6fa0f;1568905331.0;/r/analytics/comments/d6fa0f/analytics_without_numbers_viewing_products/;Analytics without numbers: Viewing products through users’ eyes; Here are two things you’ll hear a lot from product teams:1. A lot of data is needed to reduce uncertainty and get an accurate picture of users’ needs and behavior.2. People working on products understand and know their users well.The above statements are misconceptions, and in both cases, the reverse is true. In this post, I will discuss how analyzing user behavior without big data (debunking the first premise) will help us avoid the unpleasant outcomes of thinking you already know your users (debunking the second premise).## First misconception: We need a lot of data to reduce total uncertaintyImagine an infinite sized pool of black and white balls. Your task is to find out the share of white balls. Initially, you are in a state of complete uncertainty. How much data do you need to find the answer to this question?If you take 100 random balls and calculate the proportion of white balls, then you will know the answer with an accuracy of ± 9.8%. If you add another 100 balls, you will increase the accuracy of your answer to ± 6.9%  Add 200 more balls—you are up to ± 4.9%. Another 600 balls—up to ± 3.1%. With 9,000 more balls, you will achieve ± 1% accuracy.Did you notice that the first 100 balls gave us a lot more knowledge than the next 100, and going from 100 to 200 balls had much more impact on the accuracy than the 1,000-10,000 range?Let’s keep this in mind and move on to the second misconception.## Second misconception: People working on products understand and know their users wellThe second misconception assumes we understand the products we are working on.The truth is, we don’t.We are always looking for ways to close the gap between the product model we envision and the actual product we build. To do so, we try out new tools and approaches, communicate with users, conduct experiments and analyze data.The goal behind all of these activities is simple. We want to improve our understanding of the product and users, to find opportunities for growth and development, and to increase the proportion of the right decisions we make.## Viewing the product through users’ eyesWhat was this long introduction about? I want to introduce you to a method that will allow you to learn a lot about your product. It is very simple:*Take a few users and observe how they use your product.*No, you don’t have to conduct an interview with these users. There’s also no need to calculate the metrics that characterize their behavior in the product. We literally need to take a specific user and monitor how she interacts with the product throughout her entire period of usage.How can you do it? If you already have event logging set right in the product, it is very simple:1. Select the group of users you want to study (you will need different users to get answers to different questions).2. For each user of this group, create a sequence of all the events they generate, including the event parameters, from the time they start using the product.3. You will end up with a sequence of events for each user in your product. You can divide this sequence into separate sessions for convenience.You can also do it with the help of Amplitude’s User Look-Up tool.Now you have everything you need to view the product through the user’s eyes. Look at the sequence of events and start analyzing it. Take notes along the way.You will observe what the user does while going through the onboarding and afterward, what difficulties she encounters along the way, at what point her first session ends, whether she has experienced the product’s value by that time, when does she retain and how long it takes her to do so, and much more.Now, let’s go back to the first misconception. Studying a small number of users (50-100) with this method will help you find out the following:1. How and why do people use your product?2. What problems do they face at different stages in your product?3. How does the actual usage differ from what you designed the product for4. Which users tend to stay and which tend to leave? What are the differences between them?Another benefit of doing this type of analysis is that it helps you come up with a bunch of hypotheses that you can test/validate through data analysis, experiments or user research.## Case studies of analyzing user behavior through session analysisThe method we described above solves a wide range of tasks, so it can be considered quite universal. Here are a few cases where session analysis proved to be very useful.## Yandex Maps RedesignRedesigning any old popular service is extremely risky. It’s very important not to break any of the existing use cases in the new design.A few years ago, I worked on the redesign of the web version of [Yandex Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.yandex.yandexmaps&hl=en), the most popular online map service in Russia and CIS market with over 30 million users. Due to the complexity and scale of the task, we wanted to make sure we understood thoroughly all the use cases our users have. To do that we decided to manually analyze user sessions.We selected a few hundred random users, manually examined their sessions, categorized them, and wrote down our observations. The result was a table of existing product use cases and their popularity.You might argue that this approach was not necessary, that we could have just calculated the share of people who used the product to build routes, those who checked the traffic jams, or searched for organizations, etc. But these quantitative indicators would have hidden a lot of useful and critical information about the way people solve their problems with the product.It turned out, for example, that different people used the same features and solved similar tasks in completely different ways. And it was something we should have considered in the new version of the product.In the process, we made a number of unexpected discoveries. For example, it seemed obvious to us that in the task “to find an organization on a map -> find out how to get there,” users build a route directly from the organization’s snippet (see the orange arrow in the screenshot).In reality, however, it turned out that only a small percent of users did this. Most users simply copied the address of the organization and pasted it in the routes tab to build a new route (see the green arrow on the screenshot).I don’t know any other way to learn about such unexpected twists in users’ behavior other than tracking their events and examining their sessions. And the fact that such behavior exists entails many questions. Creating routes directly from the organization’s snippet is clearly easier than copy-pasting its address in the route tab. Why are users missing it? Is the organization’s featured snippet overloaded with data? Are users not noticing the button?## Finding problems in the first versions of [King of Thieves](https://www.kingofthieves.com/)When creating products, we usually assume people are going to use them in the “correct” way. We design a product in a way that helps users discover its core value as soon as possible.Surprisingly, “silly” users always do everything in their own way instead of the way we anticipate. This is exactly what happened with the first versions of King of Thieves.King of Thieves is a mobile game in which you have to break into dungeons and steal treasures and gems. You can play the game in single-player mode, but the true value of the game is in its competitive multiplayer mode. The key feature of the game is to steal gems from other players to become the wealthiest thief. At the same time, players must defend their own treasures and build traps in order to stop rivals from stealing their treasures.King of Thieves turned out to be a very successful game—but the launch of its first version was a disaster.The game’s retention was a poor 26%. Most players left the game shortly after they tried it and never came back.To understand the reasons behind this, we looked at the user sessions in the way described above. We wanted to understand what was wrong.The core value of the game was in its multiplayer mode. When creating the game’s onboarding, we assumed that we would show how the game mechanics work in the first levels of the single-player campaign, and then players would switch to the multiplayer mode when they were ready. That’s exactly why we made a huge red multiplayer button after all!But it turned out that most users simply went through the single-player levels without ever paying attention to the multiplayer game mode. After some time, they got stuck in a difficult level, or just got bored, and abandoned the game.There were few who switched to multiplayer, but in most cases the players saw no difference from the single-player mode. The opponent either had no gems to steal, or he did, but when players completed the level, they weren’t awarded the gem, even though stealing gems from other players was part of the game’s core loop.After analyzing the sessions of several hundred users (the sessions were very short, so it didn’t take us too long), we figured out that less than 10% of users had a chance to experience the essence of the game in their first few sessions. Those who grasped it were much more likely to keep playing the game.Of course, we should not forget that at that point, this was just a correlation—it did not necessarily mean that players kept playing the game because of that experience. Nonetheless, it was a good starting point, and the hypothesis that walking more users through this experience will improve the metrics was worth testing.We could have probably found this problem through metrics alone: We would see that a very small percentage of new users try the multiplayer mode. And in most cases, those who do try do not steal gems from their opponents. But we didn’t know exactly what we were looking for or when we needed to pay our attention. Perhaps everything was fine, and players simply didn’t find the mechanics of the game entertaining enough.We launched a new version of the game in which we walked players through the multiplayer mode in the onboarding and also made sure that when players attack a dungeon, there’s a gem for them to retrieve and they actually get it after completing the level. As a result, the game metrics significantly improved: Day 1 retention soared from 26% to 41%, while Day 7 retention increased from 9% to a healthier 20%.While examining the sessions and looking at the product through the eyes of our users, we found the stark contradiction between what players experienced and what we wanted them to actually experience.## Optimizing the Funnel of adding a flight in [App in the Air](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/app-in-air-best-flight-tracker/id527299553)Here is a wonderful example that Bayram Annakov shared in his [blog](https://medium.com/@bayramannakov/funnel-analysis-investigating-why-users-drop-6cccbbe41968#.d6c2vl77l).App in the Air is a mobile app that keeps track of your itineraries, boarding passes, and frequent-flier programs. The application helps ease the frustration and complexities of finding and managing flights.However, the product team found that 30% of users of the App in the Air didn’t add a flight after opening the app screen where they were expected to do that.The problem turned out to be pretty trivial, as has been the case in many similar problems. The users would search for the name of the airline or airport they sought in their native language—the search worked only in English.The funnel demonstrated that 30% of users churn at a certain step, but in order to find out why, it was necessary to go one level deeper and look at what exactly people were doing at that step.After making sure all the app’s localized languages were considered, the churn rate at this funnel step declined from 30% to 5%.## Personal sales firstY Combinator co-founder Paul Graham has an iconic essay titled “[Do things that don’t scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html).” One of the things Graham mentions is that founders should personally find their first customers and help them onboard into their product, serving as a tutorial manual in a way.Why? Because it gives the opportunity to look at your product through users’ eyes, which in turn allows you to quickly find points your users don’t understand, where they find the maximum value, and what is and isn’t important to them.It is true that this can be labor intensive and not fun at all. It is way easier and less stressful to look at a drop in the funnel at a specific step than to seek and observe lack of understanding in real people to whom you’ve recently spoken about all the advantages of your service.Personal sales work great for B2B products. In fact, session analysis is a variation of this approach that is more suitable for B2C products (though it can also work for B2B). Now you can select the users you need and study them in detail, like in the previous example with App in the Air, where users reached the screen where they could add a flight, but for some reason didn’t complete the step.Moreover, you can also contact these users personally later and ask them the questions you have in mind. This will make the overall picture as complete as possible.## Pros and cons of analyzing user sessions manuallyAnalyzing user sessions will give you a more decent understanding of how people are using your product. This is not an abstract knowledge of how various popular features and conversion of various funnel steps work, but a vivid idea about your users’ paths within the product from the moment they start using it until they either churn or your service becomes a part of their life.Another bonus of such an analysis is making it easier for you to work on new things in the product. Having a clear picture of the current paths of your users inside the service, you can better predict how and at what stage the planned changes will affect them. This increases your chances of making the right decision.Unlike using metrics, this method loses much less information along the way. But, as is usually the case, it also has its disadvantages. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to compare different versions of the product based on the manual session analysis method. You will have to analyze too many of them to obtain statistically significant results. In this case, metrics, cohort analysis, and A/B tests will help you.## Summing it upMany think that analytics is all about numbers and mathematics. In my opinion, analytics should help you to understand your product and answer questions you have about it. Numbers and metrics can help with this and solve some problems rather well, but you should not limit yourself to them. For some tasks, other approaches, including manual session analysis, will do a much better job.Try examining the session of 50 users of your product. If you don’t find anything interesting, you’ve only lost a few hours of your time. However, and I can bet on it, you will probably find a few pleasant surprises.;Fantastic text! Thanks for sharing! We have a lot of good experience with manual usability tests, really a lot of good surprises!#[removed]
gamedesign;d4xrw5;1568622448.0;/r/gamedesign/comments/d4xrw5/dream_job_game_economist/;Dream job: Game Economist;Hello everyone,  I'm an Economics student, currently in South Korea as an exchange student. I really want to end up working creating and regulating in game economies but I'm not sure how to start learning about it and include that knowledge in my CV so I can find an internship related to that. I'm taking a few Big Data courses and I plan to read a couple of books I've found about the subject, but I'm looking for more resources and even courses to take about in game economies. Also I would like to create or participate in any project that needs economy design.   That's why I'm asking you guys if you have any advice on how I can learn and start aiming my path towards my dream job.;Managing an economy isn't an entry level job, so assume you'll start out as a general game designer. Which means you should be able to do all of that work - writing detailed specs, implementing and testing config, understanding player behavior, critical analysis, and so on.  Get a job at a company making free-to-play games. They have the most complex in-game economies that need the most work. Tell the beleaguered designer working on the economy that you want to help. You will immediately have econ work to do. It will be a lot of 'How does the game feel if X cost Y instead' type things. Be dedicated and play it and get all that feedback.  Once you're there, start breaking out the analysis. Look at shortages or surpluses of resources in live economies, things like that. Use real observations and your own theory and experience to craft something new as a systems designer on a new game. Congratulations, you are now an experienced economy designer. I'll look for you at the secret meetings and teach you the handshake.#Make the best economy out there! Because the ones out there in current large scale games now are pretty bad.#In addition to the other comments I would like to add, just create one. Design an in-game economic system on your own. The subject you're working with is one that doesn't need to change a lot between games if it is designed well. Depending on configuration your system could work for simple and complex games. If you built a good economic system that developers could integrate into their games you could make a good amount of money just selling it yourself making it available for purchase on different game engines. Or, put it in your portfolio and you're sure to catch the attention of many companies.#All games have economies. Every single one. Make sure not to ignore others that don't have money/items/etc.#I'm actually approaching this issue from the other side. Instead of creating and managing economies, I'm more interested in observing and characterizing the behavior of MMO markets to see how well they match up with expectations. It's still humans managing scarce resources, so it *should*, but I don't want to know if it should, I want to *know* if it *does.*  I'm working with one of the professors on a very basic research project looking at commodities like low-level metal ores and seeing what the actual market data says about how people choose to buy/sell. I decided to do it this way because it was a very direct, practical, hands-on application of economics to something I already have a fair amount of knowledge about.  That said, I have little to no interest in working the actual game development side of things. I'm older, I have a family, and game dev just isn't a lifestyle I'm interested in anymore. I'm more interested in the academic research side of things. If I'm really lucky, I might eventually get paid to do it, we'll see.

I would start with Flat Iron and then look for like companies trying to solve issues like curing cancer solutions.

Analysts use PCA, random forests, regressions, neural nets etc to build automated routines that can correctly classify, identify, quantify and authenticate samples measured through spectrometers and other instruments.  This can be used to ensure medicines are uncontaminated, that food is healthy, that blood sugars are within bounds and a variety of other ""confirm it's safe and good"" applications.  The ratio of (evil + corporate greed) : (actual human goodness) within the field is pretty reasonable I find.  Also, there's a lot of it *in* Germany.  My favorite application scientist, with whom I work remotely every day, is based in Germany.    Yeah, a Ph.D. is pretty much required in this field.  All of the candidates I see have their Ph.D. — I was just getting a new one setup yesterday, doing image processing on OCT scans.  To find such jobs, I'd do periodic searches including terms like spectroscopy, application scientist, chemometrics, medical devices, biomed, biotech etc (as well as machine learning and so forth).  Browse the listings of healthcare, pharma, and medical device companies (both big ones like Bosch or Philips and small ones).    Go on LinkedIn, search using keywords similar to those above, and find profiles of people with jobs and careers like you'd want to have, then reach out to them  see where they've worked, and check the job pages of those companies.  If you don't find enough similar profiles on LinkedIn, start by reaching out to a handful of technical recruiters.  Those people are usually connected to tens of thousands of engineers, who are themselves connected to all the scientists they've worked with, and suddenly you'll start finding more ""hits"" in your searches.  Also, to make yourself more appealing, look up various commercial analytic tools used to process data, download the free / demo versions, play around with them, and add them to your resume.  This doesn't mean you're an expert, it means you've used it some and can find your way around the product.

Yes. At least in the US, PhD bigotry is huge in the field. There's so little interesting work that anyone will actually pay for  what there is (and it's usually high school statistics, dressed up to seem more impressive than it is) is jealously guarded.   I left a PhD program after 1 year (health problems) and even though I'm 36 and know more AI/ML than many PhDs in the field, and even though I'm smarter and more skilled than the $500k/year hotshots (there are plenty smarter than me, but they suck at marketing themselves and are nowhere near $500k) I *still* deal with that shit. Get your degree. You'll be thankful you did-- especially if you want to vie for the tiny number of jobs that actually help the world. (Most corporate work is some variation of hurting people for money.)  Keep in mind that if you do something that's good for the world, you're likely to earn 1/3 of what you would make working for the bad guys. Evil pays  good is strapped. That doesn't mean it's not worth doing  once you have enough to survive and live reasonably well, money is worth a lot less than personal happiness.

My main work is managing the health department data repository and generating reports and insights for the health policy team. I mostly use Excel, Access, SAS, SQL server, Tableau, occasionally R.Motivation: bored with government work and tired of the bureaucratic BS, need a career boost and some exciting work, also a salary bump.Goal: data scientist /machine learning job in private sector, mainly interested health related industry like healthcare given my background, but I am open to all domains. What have I completed: Data Quest data scientist python path, took me about 6 months, love all the projects, but very introductory, especially in the machine learning part. What’s Next?1. Should I complete the Data Quest data engineer path? Will it help? It seems pretty short and can help with big data.2. I am planning to take the Andrew Ng’s machine learning course and five deep learning courses next. But I heard they are pretty theoretical and difficult.3. Should I start looking for a job now? Fee like I have the basic skills to start a entry level data scientist job that is not machine learning focused.4. What do you think I should do next? Any recommended online courses?Thank you in advance! Appreciate any comments!;"Apply for jobs. You have enough experience and can learn anything else. My newest DS is/was an epidemiologist.#> I am planning to take the Andrew Ng’s machine learning course and five deep learning courses next. But I heard they are pretty theoretical and difficult.  FWIW, I took his first Machine Learning class on Coursera back in the day, which was also said to be quite ""theoretical and hard"", and I've found the theory quite easy. I do have a degree in Physics, but I would imagine you've also done quite a bit of math for your degree. It's mostly linear algebra and stuff like that. Didn't seem hard at all.  I was more vexed by his choice of programming language (Octave), I would have preferred Python.#Find some datasets and start trying to work with messier/high dimensional data related to your past background.  Most of the gaps are going to be when you have to work with codebases or scripts that are not related to the tools you already know and/or the data is really messy. Most of the DS I know with a Bio background spent tons of time taking super high dimensional data, running PCA or something, and building a simple classifier or regression model to determine what something was or what an expected distribution was.  I'm not sure Deep Learning courses will do much for you. It would be overkill to just start throwing neural nets at things and the coursework alone won't get you a job over more exposure to data cleaning and methods.  I've hired many DS and been one myself at the Senior level and your post doesn't enough info to give a ballpark hiring decision. Typically I'd want to know more about your educational background as well as cases where you have applied the various fundamental DS skills to a specific business context that was not completely spelled out for you. I'd guess you have enough to do that, but I personally wouldn't care about any online courses you've taken.#Did you pay month by month?

bioinformatics;dc2wmd;1569977613.0;/r/bioinformatics/comments/dc2wmd/computer_science_bs_accepted_to_georgia_techs/;Computer Science BS - accepted to Georgia tech’s OMSCS program but thinking about bioinformatics instead?;I was accepted to Georgia techs online masters program for computer science which has some classes for health like big data for health analytics and stuff but I’m thinking about making a full move out of computer science to bioinformatics or similar field.I was recently diagnosed with a rare syndrome and while reading more about it, I find the field of biology still has so many problems left unsolved and that’s the kind of work I like doing - software engineering is sort of stale because the problems of web development are boring. I get that software engineering is going to make me more money right now but the general environment is uninteresting and somewhat toxic. The stuff I’m interested in is Ehler’s Danlos Syndrome and the RCCX theory.Maybe I have a case of the grass is greener. Is it worth moving into this field? Are there any introductory courses I can take to see if I like the information? Would it be worth just getting the MS in CS over trying to do a MS in bioinformatics?;My two cents as a biochemist making the move into bioinformatics: once you get into the details of something it always has potential to end up stale. I could describe the work you do with computers in the same way you describe biology, big fancy problems that are exciting and need solved. The reality of science in general is that progress is slow and hard, it's not a bunch of eureka moments one after the other about world changing problems. Additionally, bioinformatics is basically computer science applied to biological problems  if I were to do it over again I would get computer science degrees and take some biology classes. If your goal is to make a difference, look up research papers in both areas and see what interests you more. If your goal is to have a job and a good life, know that bioinformatics is much less marketable and that comp sci can make a difference in plenty of areas. All of this is to say that you should stick with comp sci and take some bio classes to see if you truly like it.#[removed]#I also have EDS and am interested in bioinformatics because of it, but I also find the topic itself interesting and would be happy working in the field whether I could secure a position related to my disease or not. I think this is what you need to consider from a career perspective. If you can't get into a position where you're working with genetic data related to EDS, will you still be happy with your work? Can you still see it as worthwhile in itself, along with it being a potential springboard towards your goal? If yes, do a full switch. If no, I'm not saying it's a bad idea, but I am saying it's worth thinking on further.#Check out the Broad and Wyss Institutes over in Boston. If you live nearby or moving is an option, they have positions for Software Engineers who work with biological data sets. If not them, look around for bioinformatics jobs that you would be interested in working in while you are doing your MS. From the work you do, you'll figure out if you like it pretty quickly. You can work there while you complete your MS online, and when you finish you'll be well positioned to move to another Software Engineering role, or to go into Bioinformatics. If you decide to go into Bioinformatics, you can continue with a PhD, or move straight into an industry role after your MS in CS and bioinformatics experience.#I would recommend taking a few bio classes to make sure you're interested in the subject. At least an intro course and genetics. You should be able to find those courses for cheap at your local community college. Chances are that you won't end up working on your syndrome in particular, but maybe there will be another problem in the field you could work on that interests you.  I think it's great that you want your work to make a difference, and bioinformatics is a possibility to do that  but there are many ways you can do so. You could even use your web development skills at a company that has a mission you believe in, no need to learn a completely new skill set. Another way to make a difference is to use the extra money you are making from your lucrative career to donate to causes that matter to you.  For a more analytical approach to making a difference via your career, check out [80000 hours](https://80000hours.org/).#You may want to consider a PhD in genetics/comp bio instead. A masters wont get you super far in research and you would likely need a PhD eventually anyway. You could also look into working in a lab as postbac as another option too.#Is your undergrad in CS? If so, the bioinformatics route can be a good one provided you’ll be able to do that research you’re interested in. If not, stay in CS.#To quote my supervisor: Don't waste your time  I was wondering the same thing as you, to the point asking my supervisor if I should do another master 2 in Biology to fill the hole in my biology knowledge. What he gave me is a state and a lecture on how I will learn on the job, I should concentrate on what I do best (informatics) and all if I get to PhD there are plenty chances to fill in those hole.   Furthermore as my intern progress, I find that I learned way more and more efficient by actually talking to the biologist I was collaborating. So I guess don't worry too much, there are plenty of jobs for (kinda) pure computer scientist in this field.#I am a current MS Bioinformatics student at GA Tech! I’m graduating this December and staying here to start my PhD in January, also in Bioinformatics.  Plenty of my colleagues were CS majors with no biology background, and they really seem to love it. Also the program is only 1.5 years, and I already have friends in my cohort getting jobs both bioinformatics and non-bioinformatics related (data science jobs mostly). If it’s something you’re interested in pursuing but not sure if it’s what you want to do, I’d say go for it because it’s such a short program and the skills you learn are applicable to plenty of other fields not biology related if you change your mind.  If you’re concerned about cost of the degree: if you do research in the lab, you have the opportunity to earn a GRA award which provides a monthly stipend, and a HUGE reduction in tuition. With that I’ve only had to take out $25k in loans as an out of state student, which is nothing compared to plenty of other programs. Plus it looks great on your resume.  I also have a friend in the program graduating this December that received a $130k salary job offer, so good salaries for MS bioinformatics degrees are definitely out there!

As it is now, each member profile is loaded with Ajax calls that get results back (json) from the DB but we need to edit those records and when dealing with a big data table it gets frustrating to just apply a filter or change a state of an element.Questions:   1. Is re-writing the whole app in react+node is the best solution for scalability and future-proof?  2. Should I just introduce React as the Rendering framework of my php returns and keep my structure as is?  3. Is there a better combination if I need to build such an app?Hopefully I will get a better experts answer than from the youtube tutorials i've been watching lately about this.Thanks!;What is causing the slowdown in your current app? Have you identified it as an issue in the ajax calls or is it the fundamental structure of your data?#Sounds like db read and write is the pain point. React/node won’t necessarily fix that. You use react for ui state management and node for concurrency and JavaScript goodness. Perhaps getting your db in order is the way#Sounds like you have significant tech debt, and a rewrite should seriously be considered. You'd have to compare the total cost of fixing or maintaining the current system (including e.g. customers/revenue lost) to the cost of a rewrite. Almost certainly a rewrite will be better for the business over the long term, IF executed correctly. Of course, large software projects have a high failure rate so you have to assess that risk as well and decide whether it is worth it.  One possibility is that there is a simple fix for the slowness that was overlooked. That would be the most ideal case and certainly a possibility that should be investigated.#Also to add to my previous comment, my DB has a lot of relationships between multiple tables and I make a lot of JOIN calls when loading data with php-MySQL queries#\> As it is now, each member profile is loaded with Ajax calls that get results back (json) from the DB but we need to edit those records and when dealing with a big data table it gets frustrating to just apply a filter or change a state of an element.  Sounds like you want to use a React/GraphQL architecture. But if you're unfamiliar with this, you will struggle to rebuild the carbon copy of what you currently have.  Good luck.#AWS maybe not the best for now in terms of API deployments.  The app is robust and works very well for a smaller number or records....that’s my issue.  The calls to the dB are too many to count at this point  That’s why I can’t just repay him...it would probably take me the same time to rewrite with a proper framework.  Therefore I’m asking is MERN the way to go or should rewrite it with a proper MVC php framework so that it can stay as close as possible to what we currently have ?
analytics;dc1n5w;1569971650.0;/r/analytics/comments/dc1n5w/analytic_applications_and_market_overhype/;Analytic applications and market overhype?;[deleted];"There's a good post which I cannot locate, but I'll attempt to paraphrase.  Artificial Intelligence is a misnomer, it's certainly not artificial, and it isn't sentient, but it's exceptionally good at performing tasks (like chess or go).  The first thing that you do before a task is to make a decision.  In business this happens thousands of times a day.  When someone decides what to do, or decides direction for an entire department, division or company - those decisions are made from a blend of data, experience and inuition.  But making data centric decisions based on tasks means that those decisions (which are tasks themselves) can be automated, augmented and have a better outcome.  This reduces risk and the labor of decision making.  If you can avoid launching the next crystal Pepsi, acquiring AOL or simply reduce the amount of time it takes to analyze your indirect spend, marketing asset performance or financial modeling - you can save the company millions.   A few examples I've worked on include propensity modeling, segmentation, pricing optimization, causative factors for declining metrics, optimization of collateral, sentiment analysis, part failure and a host of supply chain issues.    There's definitely too much hype and most ISV SaaS products shouldn't use it as a marketable product feature - unless that is their category.  Some plucky dev embeds a lone regression in their SaaS app and suddenly, ""now with advanced data science.""  PM if want more details.#I think there are 2 different questions here... 1 about big data, which another poster answered, and the second about specific statistical techniques. I’d check the data science subreddit if you want answers to the second as they’re probably better suited to answer that question.#I hear both of these all the time, too. At every company and meetup (bc I go to a lot of data meetups). I think people see it as a magical solution - “we’ll just toss all our various data pieces into a blender and it’ll spit out amazingly accurate predictions that will earn us greater profits/market share.” Except you need a team of people, adequate time, and a specific goal to get these great predictions, and even then you’ll still make mistakes because your analysts can’t tell the future.#This is absolutely true.  Most company leaders in a corporate setting don't have a fat f\*cking clue that they are talking about when it comes to machine learning and many technology topics for that matter.  Many of them were in senior leadership positions when the tech revolution hit and they were able to maintain their power without advancing their skill set.  This is why I had to get out of corporate america.  It's a good tool to get paid well and save up some money until you can start your own thing but just be aware that bullshitting and bringing nothing in terms of hard skills to the table is common among corporate managers.  Success in corporate america is about  &#x200B   * accidentally being born some combination of tall, rich, and good looking * staying in one role until you win the war of attrition to get promoted and then immediately leaving to parlay your promotion into a better one - rinse repeat * wearing nice clothes and maintaining an immaculate appearance and the ""corporate attitude"" * buzz word stuffing in front of the boss * throwing peers and subordinates under the bus for personal gain * writing 3 ambiguous posts a week on LinkedIn that have the word ""leadership""  &#x200B   Now to answer your question about a concrete example of machine learning in action.  The best example I've seen was an Azure machine learning platform overview where we examined a fictitious regional bank with a plethora of historical loan data.  Using this data we configured the machine learning platform to examine certain data points within the historical data and connecting them to to historical loan decisions to train the web service.  For instance we might look at:  &#x200B   * gender * age * household income * net worth  Feed that data into some of the pre-built algorithms and tell the model what the final loan decision was - approved or not approved  With enough data and training the model can be fed a new combination of gender, age, household income, and net worth and be able to predict with a percentage confidence what the loan decision should be.  Example 1  * male * 32 * 80,000 * 100,000  Decision *approved* (90% confidence in decision)  Example 2  * female * 35 * 80,000 * 0  Decision *not approved* (70% confidence)  &#x200B   Machine learning is often built into web services that can be fed defined data points like this and then spit out a result and degree of confidence.  If the confidence is too low a human might have to make a manual review of the full application.  The complexity often lies within not constructing individual building blocks like the example above but in the data sanitation, training  of the algorithm, and the building of a ""nueral network"".  Data sanitation might be something like converting all the null values to 0 and then grouping them into buckets.  For instance the algorithm will have a harder time predicting exact income levels because the historical data for the exact income level will be limited.  However if you run scripts to clean the data and *group it into $10,000 increments* the available data *per income level* is greater and the algorithims can predict with a higher degree of confidence.  You also don't want to rely on a single algorithimthic result.  You might run the same data through 2-3 different predictive algorithims and then average out the decisions and the confidence degrees.  This reduces the risk of some funky data creating false postive and false negative results and make the machine learning web service overall more stable.  This daisy chaining consolidating of results is called creating a ""nueral network""  Knowing the appropriate level of data consolidation and algorithimic risk averaging is why we need data scientists to train these things.  Hope that helps! Stick with it, it's going to be an exciting field."

Let me first say that this is not a shit post on Pokemon. I love the both of them. Each has their own charms. Still, I have a few thoughts and would love to know what you guys think.I guess I will introduce myself first for you guys to know where I am coming from. I am a casual but long time Digimon fan. I LOVED watching the anime series as a kid and teen, and spent considerable amount of time on the 3 original Digimon World games on PS1, especially Digimon World 3 and I am currently playing Digimon World Re:digitize on emulator. So I was wondering has there been any interesting developments regarding this franchise and search for it on Google. Results should come up plenty, right? But no, finding information on this was ... hard and scarce until I remembered Reddit, and here I am. I am not posting to ask for info though. I can piece together tidbits here and there.Well, onto the titular topic. Pokemon as a franchise is simple, I guess, which I think is one of its strengths. You don't have to know anything to begin playing one of the games and literally aside from the settings, all the games are the same. You just beat the gyms, catch them all and go along with the storyline. This tremendously help young fans generation after generation to get into the franchise. Digimon, on the other hand, is much more complicated. Setting-wise, you can literally craft any environment (steampunk, fantasy, science-based, etc.) you want, because it's digital and as long as the idea exists, that setting should be somewhere in the digital world. The number of ""mons"" along is already crazy high, over 1000 of them and among them, the different factions like the Royal Knights, 7 Great Demon Lords, the Olympos XII, the Celestial and Holy digimons, etc. are after different things. These factors, including human's interventions can craft a very complex and expansive narrative. But I have never seen enough thought put to utilize these assets to good use. Each anime series is like a bubble of itself, except the first two, and the games are really fragmented with no coherent stortylines and world-building, except for the recent games on PSP (Vita) and PS4. Imagine a Digimon world but massive open-environment with nuanced storyline that take into account all the franchise has to offer, it would be one (or more?) of the best game and anime based on the potential of storyline and world-building. If I can get someone like Kevin Feige to work on the Digimon franchise, I would.All the ranting aside, I am just sad that the Digimon franchise is so underutilized while its potential has always been massive. Off course, my knowledge of the franchise is limited and I may be wrong in writing this so please correct me if I have been missing anything, but the idea is still there.Well, that's all folks. I would love to hear what you guys think regarding this subject and also what you guys would do if you are in charge of the franchise?My idea would be planning a re-introduction of appmons, making them a emerging subtypes of digimons that come in power recently because of the smartphone advancement and culture, which invades and threatens the whole order of the digital world. This can spawn an anime series and games which follow different characters as they are looking into different aspects of this ""war"". Like, you can have one storyline following a protagonists who are trapped inside the digital worlds and the other storyline following detectives or researches looking into strange events resulted from this war from the human side. And we haven't even talked about Big Data and AI, imagine what that would be like for the digital world.Edit: You know what? An idea just sparked in my head. Imagine ... Social Network Overlord-mons! They are literally Overlords because they are in control of so much information, data and how everything flows.";I think the place they majorly messed up was the US localisation. Other then that, other countries did a good job keeping the original feel intact, which is also the reason why Digimon is far fondly remembered in Latin America and Asian markets than US. Their games have been good for the most parts, and in the last few years, way better than Pokémon, atleast in terms of quality. But yeah, Digimon didn't reach its potential as a merch factory mainly because it had no singular vision as a whole. It reacted way too quickly to trends after Tamers. Fate is doing better, and the fact that lore of Infinite universes cannot be handled properly is not really backed up properly, considering franchises that are doing it better.#Pokemon is the single highest money making franchise of all time. It's higher than stuff like Marvel, Mario, GTA, Call of Duty - whatever you can name, Pokemon has made more money than it.   So if you wanna go that route, *everything* is mishandled compared to Pokemon.#I just think that pokemon had better campaigning in the beginning and more money thrown at games and merch#Pokemon is just boring and every game that comes out AND the anime of it is 97% the same as the previous season of pokemon, it might be my personal taste but I hate repeated stuff yet pokemon and scooby doo are the most famous shows despise their uncreativity  It's just that people's tastes are shit :P#Digimon was never really that popular to begin with.  In my whole school,back in andventure series it was only me and my friend tha we used to watch it .For the others it wash just a cheap pokemon imitation.   I dont know how was things in Japan but the way they tried to push the show in the west was not flattering. The whole aggressive anti-pokemon thing while being in the pokemania period turned a lot of people away.  Also no one talks about the games exept the hardcore digimon fans. I love digimon but i have never played a game and never felt to.I will probably try the collection when it comes to Switch.

What price would be low enough for you to not wornder if   >is the price to good to be true??   >is this ENEB university legit?  Yes, but the people who are scamming you have nothing to do with them.#According to eneb.com, absolutely not. The offer quoted in your OP is a scam.  The currency should alert you, Barcelona is in Spain. Spain uses Euros (€).  As for pricing, the MBA in Supply Chain Management is €8,400, or €2,940 with a scholarship.#>not going to include the link as so it does not look like spam  The link would really have been the best indicator - if it's not located on the official university website, it's going to be a scam (that does not mean that the university is a scam, but rather that someone sells you something that does not exist).#It seems legit, poor, but interesting nonetheless. I bought it yesterday on a lark and got a response within 12 hours with login information.  They did ask for a resume or CV when I registered. The Spanish site is [eneb.es](https://eneb.es) and the English site is [eneb.com](https://eneb.com), so it's probably a for-profit school in the US.  The system is based on Moodle which is a very old learning management system.  The modules are poorly translated English, so a little difficult to read.  The MBA curriculum is modeled after a typical US MBA curriculum only with fewer case studies than one would find in a stateside school. The virtual library has real texts, but of course you have to read them online.   I think for someone interested in learning about business it's not a bad deal.  On the other hand, it might be hard to say that one has an MBA after finishing the program.#Here is a website link for  ""Tuition fees of online MBA degree programs in Spain""  [https://www.eligemba.com/online-mba-degree-programs-cost-spain/](https://www.eligemba.com/online-mba-degree-programs-cost-spain/)ENEB is appropriately listed.  This is a third party publication that verifies the program.  When you click on the link you will get three website options:  Spain, Portugal, and English.  Spain has a es suffix,  Portugal a pt suffix, and English a .com suffix.   If you Google The University of Cambridge you will see that they do not use the standard edu suffix ([https://www.cam.ac.uk/](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) ). Some have raised questions about that website difference.   Not all European schools use the .edu suffix, many are related to country (see uk - above).  Why the .com in the U.S.  - I presume it was an efficient marketing tool as the would not have to apply for the .edu suffix. Then there is a question of accreditation.  Most European countries have departments or ministries that recognize schools - thus they don't have the same type of accreditation that exists in the United States.  In the U.S. the regional accreditors dominate, but there are specific accreditors (TRACS - for Christian post-secondary schools) and even a national accrediting body - the Distance Education Accreditation Council (DEAC).  So for European schools - appropriate governmental recognition is the accreditation equivalent.    If so recognized, clearly legitimate and legal degrees. There are then questions regarding how one uses an international degree in the United States.  To determine equivalence,  there are credential evaluation organizations/service providers.  For example, Texas lists such agencies: [https://tea.texas.gov/Texas\_Educators/Certification/Out-of-State\_Certification/Foreign\_Credential\_Evaluation\_Services](https://tea.texas.gov/Texas_Educators/Certification/Out-of-State_Certification/Foreign_Credential_Evaluation_Services) . Now regarding some particulars about the program at ENEB, each course follows a course module format and includes a ""case study,"" a standard business education model.  Some have questioned the number of cases, per course, for a graduate level program.  I have not begun my program, so I cannot comment on that aspect of the program.  Some have questioned the LMS. The LMS (learning management system) is Moodle.  Some universities/colleges use this LMS. Here is a limited list: [https://www.eclass4learning.com/colleges-universities-use-moodle/](https://www.eclass4learning.com/colleges-universities-use-moodle/) .  It is a legitimate LMS system and generally has lower cost to operate.    I did inquire about their programs.  I learned that their use of Groupon is a marketing strategy.   The price is perceptually unrealistic to sustain an institution. Yet, if you want to market your institution can you buy direct advertising (i.e. Purdue Global) or you can market through a service like Groupon.   Regarding the development of an online course and program, once it is developed it can be delivered at a much lower price point.  For example, the college I teach at has paid faculty to develop courses for approximately $2500 each.  Since we are a two year institution the total developmental costs for a degree would be $50,000 (20 courses, 3 credits each for a 60 credit associate degree).  Thus creating an online program can be cost effective. Regarding instruction, faculty at my institution are paid either by student or course, depending on enrollment numbers.   I suspect much of the ENEB program has automated assessment, with the exception of the case study.   So the ENEB program would be cost effective at their tuition rate at the website, still cost effective with their scholarship rate, and not cost effective at their Groupon rate  unless your desire is to gain international exposure or additional revenue, even if a marginal amount.   Regarding admissions, they require documentation of the completion of a bachelors degree to generally enroll in the program   but they do allow you to start the program in your junior or senior year - that is complete some of the graduate courses - but you must finish the bachelors degree before you can complete the masters degree.  Some US schools allow taking limited graduate courses while an undergraduate.   Regarding quality, that is a perceptual matter. There are average MBA and masters degree programs at any number of schools in the US.  Just felt the need to post some comments about the opportunity at ENEB and in a context regarding concerns raised within the discussion thread.     Dr. Bruce LeBlanc, EdD, MPA, MA, MA, MS, MAPAC#Yeah - I bought it and it’s legit :)#I am more worried about the accreditation. It seems that the Groupon is legit. It also makes sense IMO that it is cheap since they are really just giving you access to training modules. The online format potentially has very little overhead. In America some colleges are ""Accredited"" by essentially made up accreditation authorities, therefore a joke.# This is too good to be true. There's this college with more than 50.000 students and they charge 7600€ for their courses....    Don't you think they mean monthly payments? I mean... if they include the whole master's degree with a university title for only 249 €... I'll take 10, please! LMAO#110% scam. The GRE test just to get into graduate school is over $200 and you truly believe you can get a legit master's degree for $249?#I’m monitoring this, so anyone who actually bought it: keep us advised.  As to “why”...Even if it’s just access to the material, I think it might be worth $250. I don’t need the accreditation...just the knowledge.   Like Will said in Good Will Hunting “you dropped $150 grand on a fuckin education you could have got for a $1.50 in late chahges (sic) at the public library”.   That said...I still want to know what I’m getting for the $250. Lol#seems tots legit. i wrote to the school through its facebook page and they said 100% yes. translation and original message below.

I've found this thread were a bunch of people talk about it and some even bought it and explain what is there to see/do. Have a look by yourself https://www.degreeforum.net/mybb/Thread-MBA-and-MA-at-ENEB-for-just-under-300?page=3  I know my karma is shitty (cause of a lazy post I wrote some while ago) but I'm not in anyway affiliated to ENEB. Just have a look on that link :) Hope it helps.#I saw it on Living Social this week. Wondering what kind of laugh it would get from hiring managers when they saw European Business School of Barcelona and the potential questions.  Did you go to Barcelona to attend? Only in my mind. And yet $249.... it beckons me...#Since we're talking about a business degree here, let's look at what ENEB is doing through that lens, and see if what they're offering is unsustainable, as some have claimed.   1st, I've read through comments and share the skepticism.  I'm on this to thread because I too saw the Groupon deal. I googled it because I'd love the education and was curious to see if this was a scam.   If 1M people sign up worldwide for $250, how much revenues has this school brought in? Enough to pay a staff, develop the online courses, and make offering this automated MBA course at a few hundred dollars worth while? Now times that by 10. This tuition model has the potential to bring in billions, on top of the tuitions ENEB brings in conventionally with their campuses.   Now Think of how many people worldwide would bite at taking an MBA course for such a low price. Most can afford $200-$300. If they get millions of takers, this becomes an enormous cash cow with low overhead. So from a business model aspect, this seems to pass the test.   Think too, only a small percentage of those signing up for $250 ( can't remember the exact amount)  will actually follow through with completing the course. I don't know the drop off factor, but if it's anything like the drop out rate of more expensive real estate courses, (less that 5% go on to do anything with it)  it has to be large. Low tuition= low skin in the game.  So they will only have to service a fraction of those that sign up. It's a brilliant model, if they can get past the too good to be true stigma.   That being said, I don't know If I'm going to try it. I'm already too busy as it is. But I am intrigued. For me the business education is the value, not the diploma, as I've worked for myself since I was a teenager. I'll save this thread and will check back on what others are experiencing.   And yes, I have a Reddit account, but I haven't used it at all. I mainly signed up to read articles I couldn't read unless I signed up. So go ahead, I know from the comments above, I'll probably be suspected as an undercover troll or something. Cheers.#Hey, just also come across this on groupon and wondering what you ended up going for? So far I'm leaning on just going for it as its so cheap  my logic being even worst case I'll hopefully learn something useful from it, £250 isn't exactly bank breaking...#Wow it’s ridiculously obvious this is a scam degree thing.#I bought it... about six months ago. The platform is outdated however for such a low price it's more than enough. I haven't finished... if I ever do I'll let you know if the diploma they send seems legit or not.#Hey y'all...I saw this Groupon deal and I currently am in Barcelona. I'm planning on going to their office this upcoming week to see if it's legit or if I should ask for a refund. I'll keep y'all updated :)#@roman_s thank you for this thread! Half a year later and still so important!!#Okay, so it's been 2 years, now.  For those of you who've bought/registered on a lark, what was the outcome?  Groupon STILL has the special, but I think the price has gone up slightly (inflation, I guess?).#Any update on this?#Saw this offer for the first time today on a Philippine groupon website. Same - found it too good to be true so I tried doing some research as well. I still can't find if they are accredited by any national / local education boards.  I guess the course content might still be useful (for its price) but I am still not convinced, for example, that I can put it this ""degree"" on LinkedIn."

You should be aware that you need the funds upfront to show you can support yourself on a student visa. They will ask to see savings of tuition costs + $10,000 Canadian (each year).   Finding a part time job isn't a problem if you're willing to work for minimum wage. Just be aware Barrie has terrible transit which might limit your options. You are also limited to working a **maximum** 20 hours a week during your school semester (you can do 40 hours when school is out during the summer).#I took computer programming at Georgian and did not have a great experience. A lot of the computer related teachers that I had (2 years ago) were part time, new to teaching and sometomes had never touched the subject. (my advanced Sql class was taught by a chemist - I really wish I was making that up). I love Barrie as a city and want to return badly. If you intend on staying in Canada after school, you'll likely be working in Toronto, which means you'll likely move. I would look into Sheridan as an alternative, they have several campuses closer to the city and honestly with how expensive Barrie is now it wouldn't be much different price wise

datascience;d4pdlb;1568576456.0;/r/datascience/comments/d4pdlb/cs_bachelors_to_data_science_masters_program_good/;CS bachelor's to data science master's program, good move?;I have a bachelor's degree in computer science. I am now a data analyst for a Fortune 500 company. Aside from creating MS Power BI dashboards, I also do a lot of PHP scripting, database design, and I do full stack web development too.I'm only making 62k/year at my current job. This is nowhere near what I want to be making, and the job is just sort of unfulfilling in general. I feel like I'm not using a lot of the skills I have as a person with a degree in computer science... Like basically anyone off the streets could take a month to learn SQL and accomplish most of what I do.I figure I'd be more satisfied if I got a position as a data scientist or something similar. I've always been fascinated by machine learning, AI, neural networks etc. And big data seems to be where the money is at in computer science right now too, so I figure it might be the route to take (at least for now).So now that I've got my bachelor's degree in computer science, I'm currently going to school for a master's degree in data science with a concentration in computational intelligence. I figure even if data science doesn't last, my bachelor's in computer science will still be enough to move into other things if I want to. And I'll be graduating with my Master's in December 2020, or earlier if I decide to take more classes faster. So it'll take a year and a half or less for that.Does this sound like a smart route to take in today's world of computer science? I certainly didn't get a degree in CS to make only 62k/year like I do now (especially since I already have over 100k in student debt), and I need something more complex and fulfilling. And money obviously isn't everything, but I like money and likely won't be satisfied until I'm making at least double what I'm making now. Life ain't cheap these days, and neither are my hobbies. Lol. And lots of things interest me in CS, so I might as well just go where the money is.;"I just want to say that making ""only"" 62k is nothing to be ashamed about.  Like that's quite a bit above median income and really good if you only recently finished your undergrad.  Granted with CS you could be a SWE and make 70-80+ out of school, I think you may have unreasonable expectations if you think you should already be making what you're aiming for.   That being said, if you're just noting that this is where you eventually want to end up, your strategy is solid and I see no scenario where you don't achieve what you want to if you stay on this path.  Good luck!#I think it depends on the program. If you have a good CS background, then I might suggest focusing more on data engineering, since your learning curve there will be less steep than it would be for someone who is coming in without deep CS experience. Data engineers don't really need to know much about data science, per se, but it's a nice to have.#[deleted]#I'd say you ought to address where you want to end up before researching schools. Data science programs are every bit as broad (and expensive) as the disciplines it encompasses. Some programs focus on things you may not even care about. First, go talk to data scientists, analysts, business intelligence analysts, etc about that they do.   Depending on what you like and how much programming is involved, you may be better with a CS masters. You will have to assess where you feel you're lacking and improve that within the degree. Data engineers also benefit from a CS degree.  If you find you like predictive analytics more, then DS may fit you better. I also met plenty of data scientists recently who only work on visualizations. It's all different day to day work, and I'd figure out where you might like to land before signing on to pay 20-60k in tuition.#Sounds awesome. As someone in a position who hires data scientists, I love CS folks - since I don’t have a CS background (epidemiology and biostatistics) they always bring unique ways to innovate. Good luck!"

Most use only a few percent of their unstructured data sources for anything - and whilst there may be a lot of garbage, most orgs fail on many levels to even scratch the surface of what they should know about their clients. Data size is generally not the issue, its more on the people - who fail at every turn to move past ideas of running the same SQL query they've run for a decade.#Yes.  In that case, you start processing that data on the edge before sending a subset/aggregated set to your data 'sink'.

startups;d6fcyl;1568905647.0;/r/startups/comments/d6fcyl/analytics_without_numbers_viewing_products/;Analytics without numbers: Viewing products through users’ eyes; Here are two things you’ll hear a lot from product teams:1. A lot of data is needed to reduce uncertainty and get an accurate picture of users’ needs and behavior.2. People working on products understand and know their users well.The above statements are misconceptions, and in both cases, the reverse is true. In this post, I will discuss how analyzing user behavior without big data (debunking the first premise) will help us avoid the unpleasant outcomes of thinking you already know your users (debunking the second premise).## First misconception: We need a lot of data to reduce total uncertaintyImagine an infinite sized pool of black and white balls. Your task is to find out the share of white balls. Initially, you are in a state of complete uncertainty. How much data do you need to find the answer to this question?If you take 100 random balls and calculate the proportion of white balls, then you will know the answer with an accuracy of ± 9.8%. If you add another 100 balls, you will increase the accuracy of your answer to ± 6.9%  Add 200 more balls—you are up to ± 4.9%. Another 600 balls—up to ± 3.1%. With 9,000 more balls, you will achieve ± 1% accuracy.Did you notice that the first 100 balls gave us a lot more knowledge than the next 100, and going from 100 to 200 balls had much more impact on the accuracy than the 1,000-10,000 range?Let’s keep this in mind and move on to the second misconception.## Second misconception: People working on products understand and know their users wellThe second misconception assumes we understand the products we are working on.The truth is, we don’t.We are always looking for ways to close the gap between the product model we envision and the actual product we build. To do so, we try out new tools and approaches, communicate with users, conduct experiments and analyze data.The goal behind all of these activities is simple. We want to improve our understanding of the product and users, to find opportunities for growth and development, and to increase the proportion of the right decisions we make.## Viewing the product through users’ eyesWhat was this long introduction about? I want to introduce you to a method that will allow you to learn a lot about your product. It is very simple:*Take a few users and observe how they use your product.*No, you don’t have to conduct an interview with these users. There’s also no need to calculate the metrics that characterize their behavior in the product. We literally need to take a specific user and monitor how she interacts with the product throughout her entire period of usage.How can you do it? If you already have event logging set right in the product, it is very simple:1. Select the group of users you want to study (you will need different users to get answers to different questions).2. For each user of this group, create a sequence of all the events they generate, including the event parameters, from the time they start using the product.3. You will end up with a sequence of events for each user in your product. You can divide this sequence into separate sessions for convenience.You can also do it with the help of Amplitude’s User Look-Up tool.Now you have everything you need to view the product through the user’s eyes. Look at the sequence of events and start analyzing it. Take notes along the way.You will observe what the user does while going through the onboarding and afterward, what difficulties she encounters along the way, at what point her first session ends, whether she has experienced the product’s value by that time, when does she retain and how long it takes her to do so, and much more.Now, let’s go back to the first misconception. Studying a small number of users (50-100) with this method will help you find out the following:1. How and why do people use your product?2. What problems do they face at different stages in your product?3. How does the actual usage differ from what you designed the product for4. Which users tend to stay and which tend to leave? What are the differences between them?Another benefit of doing this type of analysis is that it helps you come up with a bunch of hypotheses that you can test/validate through data analysis, experiments or user research.## Case studies of analyzing user behavior through session analysisThe method we described above solves a wide range of tasks, so it can be considered quite universal. Here are a few cases where session analysis proved to be very useful.## Yandex Maps RedesignRedesigning any old popular service is extremely risky. It’s very important not to break any of the existing use cases in the new design.A few years ago, I worked on the redesign of the web version of [Yandex Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.yandex.yandexmaps&hl=en), the most popular online map service in Russia and CIS market with over 30 million users. Due to the complexity and scale of the task, we wanted to make sure we understood thoroughly all the use cases our users have. To do that we decided to manually analyze user sessions.We selected a few hundred random users, manually examined their sessions, categorized them, and wrote down our observations. The result was a table of existing product use cases and their popularity.You might argue that this approach was not necessary, that we could have just calculated the share of people who used the product to build routes, those who checked the traffic jams, or searched for organizations, etc. But these quantitative indicators would have hidden a lot of useful and critical information about the way people solve their problems with the product.It turned out, for example, that different people used the same features and solved similar tasks in completely different ways. And it was something we should have considered in the new version of the product.In the process, we made a number of unexpected discoveries. For example, it seemed obvious to us that in the task “to find an organization on a map -> find out how to get there,” users build a route directly from the organization’s snippet (see the orange arrow in the screenshot).In reality, however, it turned out that only a small percent of users did this. Most users simply copied the address of the organization and pasted it in the routes tab to build a new route (see the green arrow on the screenshot).I don’t know any other way to learn about such unexpected twists in users’ behavior other than tracking their events and examining their sessions. And the fact that such behavior exists entails many questions. Creating routes directly from the organization’s snippet is clearly easier than copy-pasting its address in the route tab. Why are users missing it? Is the organization’s featured snippet overloaded with data? Are users not noticing the button?## Finding problems in the first versions of [King of Thieves](https://www.kingofthieves.com/)When creating products, we usually assume people are going to use them in the “correct” way. We design a product in a way that helps users discover its core value as soon as possible.Surprisingly, “silly” users always do everything in their own way instead of the way we anticipate. This is exactly what happened with the first versions of King of Thieves.King of Thieves is a mobile game in which you have to break into dungeons and steal treasures and gems. You can play the game in single-player mode, but the true value of the game is in its competitive multiplayer mode. The key feature of the game is to steal gems from other players to become the wealthiest thief. At the same time, players must defend their own treasures and build traps in order to stop rivals from stealing their treasures.King of Thieves turned out to be a very successful game—but the launch of its first version was a disaster.The game’s retention was a poor 26%. Most players left the game shortly after they tried it and never came back.To understand the reasons behind this, we looked at the user sessions in the way described above. We wanted to understand what was wrong.The core value of the game was in its multiplayer mode. When creating the game’s onboarding, we assumed that we would show how the game mechanics work in the first levels of the single-player campaign, and then players would switch to the multiplayer mode when they were ready. That’s exactly why we made a huge red multiplayer button after all!But it turned out that most users simply went through the single-player levels without ever paying attention to the multiplayer game mode. After some time, they got stuck in a difficult level, or just got bored, and abandoned the game.There were few who switched to multiplayer, but in most cases the players saw no difference from the single-player mode. The opponent either had no gems to steal, or he did, but when players completed the level, they weren’t awarded the gem, even though stealing gems from other players was part of the game’s core loop.After analyzing the sessions of several hundred users (the sessions were very short, so it didn’t take us too long), we figured out that less than 10% of users had a chance to experience the essence of the game in their first few sessions. Those who grasped it were much more likely to keep playing the game.Of course, we should not forget that at that point, this was just a correlation—it did not necessarily mean that players kept playing the game because of that experience. Nonetheless, it was a good starting point, and the hypothesis that walking more users through this experience will improve the metrics was worth testing.We could have probably found this problem through metrics alone: We would see that a very small percentage of new users try the multiplayer mode. And in most cases, those who do try do not steal gems from their opponents. But we didn’t know exactly what we were looking for or when we needed to pay our attention. Perhaps everything was fine, and players simply didn’t find the mechanics of the game entertaining enough.We launched a new version of the game in which we walked players through the multiplayer mode in the onboarding and also made sure that when players attack a dungeon, there’s a gem for them to retrieve and they actually get it after completing the level. As a result, the game metrics significantly improved: Day 1 retention soared from 26% to 41%, while Day 7 retention increased from 9% to a healthier 20%.While examining the sessions and looking at the product through the eyes of our users, we found the stark contradiction between what players experienced and what we wanted them to actually experience.## Optimizing the Funnel of adding a flight in [App in the Air](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/app-in-air-best-flight-tracker/id527299553)Here is a wonderful example that Bayram Annakov shared in his [blog](https://medium.com/@bayramannakov/funnel-analysis-investigating-why-users-drop-6cccbbe41968#.d6c2vl77l).App in the Air is a mobile app that keeps track of your itineraries, boarding passes, and frequent-flier programs. The application helps ease the frustration and complexities of finding and managing flights.However, the product team found that 30% of users of the App in the Air didn’t add a flight after opening the app screen where they were expected to do that.The problem turned out to be pretty trivial, as has been the case in many similar problems. The users would search for the name of the airline or airport they sought in their native language—the search worked only in English.The funnel demonstrated that 30% of users churn at a certain step, but in order to find out why, it was necessary to go one level deeper and look at what exactly people were doing at that step.After making sure all the app’s localized languages were considered, the churn rate at this funnel step declined from 30% to 5%.## Personal sales firstY Combinator co-founder Paul Graham has an iconic essay titled “[Do things that don’t scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html).” One of the things Graham mentions is that founders should personally find their first customers and help them onboard into their product, serving as a tutorial manual in a way.Why? Because it gives the opportunity to look at your product through users’ eyes, which in turn allows you to quickly find points your users don’t understand, where they find the maximum value, and what is and isn’t important to them.It is true that this can be labor intensive and not fun at all. It is way easier and less stressful to look at a drop in the funnel at a specific step than to seek and observe lack of understanding in real people to whom you’ve recently spoken about all the advantages of your service.Personal sales work great for B2B products. In fact, session analysis is a variation of this approach that is more suitable for B2C products (though it can also work for B2B). Now you can select the users you need and study them in detail, like in the previous example with App in the Air, where users reached the screen where they could add a flight, but for some reason didn’t complete the step.Moreover, you can also contact these users personally later and ask them the questions you have in mind. This will make the overall picture as complete as possible.## Pros and cons of analyzing user sessions manuallyAnalyzing user sessions will give you a more decent understanding of how people are using your product. This is not an abstract knowledge of how various popular features and conversion of various funnel steps work, but a vivid idea about your users’ paths within the product from the moment they start using it until they either churn or your service becomes a part of their life.Another bonus of such an analysis is making it easier for you to work on new things in the product. Having a clear picture of the current paths of your users inside the service, you can better predict how and at what stage the planned changes will affect them. This increases your chances of making the right decision.Unlike using metrics, this method loses much less information along the way. But, as is usually the case, it also has its disadvantages. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to compare different versions of the product based on the manual session analysis method. You will have to analyze too many of them to obtain statistically significant results. In this case, metrics, cohort analysis, and A/B tests will help you.## Summing it upMany think that analytics is all about numbers and mathematics. In my opinion, analytics should help you to understand your product and answer questions you have about it. Numbers and metrics can help with this and solve some problems rather well, but you should not limit yourself to them. For some tasks, other approaches, including manual session analysis, will do a much better job.Try examining the session of 50 users of your product. If you don’t find anything interesting, you’ve only lost a few hours of your time. However, and I can bet on it, you will probably find a few pleasant surprises.;Great! I'm starting to develop an app and will surely consider all this things during the launch of my MVP. Thanks!#Fantastic write up man! I found the King of Thieves section particularly interesting  expecting the user to shift to multiplayer and realizing they were (as much as they knew) content having not ever hit the meat of the application in the development team’s eyes. The obvious isn’t always so obvious, hahaha

Foster would go for you, but I would suggest being able to frame your story a bit better, maybe retake the GMAT for R2 and try to spin your work experience as a bit more people-oriented. B-schools kind of look at back-office IT/ Software guys as purely technical and not able to communicate (I mean your GMAT verbal kind of drives the nail in the coffin on this assumption as well).  Also your reason for MBA is not a very compelling one -- especially because technical consulting does not require pretty much anything that the MBA has to offer. Additionally, unless it is a huge expert-level IT cert, the adcom is probably not going to understand what it is or what the implications are.  I would say areas to focus on :  1. GMAT 1a. Stretch your w/e to be more about communication, leadership as much as you can 2. Story for reasons for choosing your roles, and better post-MBA goal#Uhhhhh not sure where all these other people are getting their data from.

elasticsearch;dcqp4x;1570108301.0;/r/elasticsearch/comments/dcqp4x/how_to_index_a_billion_records_from_multiple/;How to index a billion records from multiple sources in Elastic Search?;"Hi, I'm new here and would like to ask a question. I'm not an expert in ES and big data, but our team is starting to explore a new area before we start hiring some experts in this area. My question is about what is the right way to build an ES architecture such that we can index a billion records from multiple sources.**Background**: We have acquired about 1 billion+ records of people data, coming from multiple sources.   Each source has a slightly different ""shape"" to the data, with a large percentage of overlap (duplicates), and slightly conflicting values between fields. We have set up a pipeline using Apache Beam to transform this data and send it to an Elastic Search index so that we can search this data, but we are not sure of our approach. We are trying to achieve: 1) Paginated full text search queries on certain fields, 2) Deduplicate records (there's currently a lot of overlap within those 1b records, 3) Be able to perform regular refreshes and enrichment of the data and reindex without interrupting search performance. Our sources provide a whole new version of the previous data (rather than a changefile), about once a quarter. We'll probably enrich our data on a daily basis for a few thousand records at a time in addition to those big refreshes. What I'm wondering right now is:1. Is ElasticSearch even the right tool for the job? 2. If so, does it make sense to combine all of these ""rows"" of data from different sources into a single index (after cleaning and de-duping)?&#x200B Thanks for pointing me in the right direction! Any small advice or tips appreciated";* ES should be a fine tool for the job, although depending on how big the records are you may need a decent sized cluster for 1BN. I think ES vs some other db depends mostly on your search needs, if it's heavy in advanced fulltext ES is probably right, if your searches are mostly relational you might look at postgres or mysql. Also note that ES tends to eat ram, (you'll likely want a cluster of 64gig boxes), but for good text search performance that's mostly true of any db. * ES supports updating existing rows just fine without messing with performance (again dependent on cluster resources), including 'upserts' that only modify certain fields, which makes it easy to add/edit some fields in a record and not others. Inserts are about as fast as any other normal relational db (so mostly dependent on resources and tuning rather than some tech limit), and can be done in bulk.   Without knowing more about your data I can't say anything intelligent about whether you should have separate indexes or not, it probably depends mostly on your cleaning. Keep in mind you can always add in the source as an additional field so you can search by source.#1. Yes. Elasticsearch is great at both storing a huge amount of data and searching through it with full-text search. You might need bigger boxes than you might think depending on traffic, but it's very scale-able and resilient.  2. If you're going to be replacing the entire index every so often then it probably makes more sense to have a different index for each provider split into time series. So have something along the lines of `customer-provider-2019.01.01` then when you dump the new data use `customer-provider-2019.03.05` and drop the old index. That's going to be a lot faster than trying to update each record.#On the de-duplication matter, Logstash and it's fingerprint input plugin is your friend.  Logstash can read a record from an input source (like an existing ES index or other source) and (using the fingerprint input plugin) generate a record \_id based on a calculated hash of chosen fields, and then output that record to an ES index. If the ES index already contains a record that has the \_id, it will overwrite the existing record and thus eliminate the (existing) duplicate.  This is nice for two reasons- one, it allows you to take all your varying input sources of records (*read: not necessarily ES indexes (though they can be used as well)*) and (*via the grok and mutate input plugins*) come up with a single format of fields that will be used for your records on the ES cluster, conceivably on a single index. Second, it allows you to ensure that no duplicates are written to your ES cluster from the get-go (*i.e. you don't have to go through one step of ES index ingestion of all sources and then an additional step of performing record de-duplication.*)#Elasticsearch is probably what you want for the search part. Frequent updates can bloat the indices somewhat so you'd want to regularly call force merge or index into a new index and discard the old index when done. You can use aliases to avoid disrupting read traffic. You may also want to use specialized query, data, and master nodes to further minimize impact of that. If that is still a concern, you could use a separate cluster for indexing and deploy snapshots to your query cluster or use replication.  The rest is really your data pipeline. If you can use some clever id scheme for deduplicating that would be helpful. Whether that makes sense for your data, depends on the data. If you can come up with some shared schema than yes, if that is hard, maybe work with separate indices for your different data sources. Using Kafka with queue compaction might work for you.

I've already graduated (May 19), but I didn't have an actuarial internship.I do, however, have 2 data analyst internships (one in experimental design/analysis, the other in big data analysis) with departments at my university.To what extent would an employer care about these compared to an actuarial internship? Should I try to pursue an actuarial-specific internship?;I'd say apply for actuarial internships and actuarial full time. It really depends on the company and how well you can articulate the roles and how it's related to actuarial work. Honestly, if you've had a data related internship, it's close enough to an actuarial internship (IMO).#Internships aren't a pre-requisite to full time entry level jobs.  They just make you more competitive.  It really just would decrease how many applications you might have to send out to get successful interviews scheduled, and might narrow your options to the less exciting positions, but it's no big deal, actuaries start in one job wherever they get it and in a year or two move to one they're more excited about, only to eventually realize that all jobs are equally undesirable.

Data analytics or data science vs web development (Javascript, ruby, react, css, html)Granted I know that sales is important, but in terms of tech skills, what would be a better skill to have in today's day? I'm asking because I know that big data is the future, so should I ditch traditional programming in favor of learning data science?Thanks;This is a strange way of looking at it imo.  Tech entrepreneurship is a very broad term- can't exactly recommend a path if you dont provide information about what you want to do entrepreneurially.  Further, data analytics, data science, and programming are all intertwined.  You can't do anything with data unless you have some programming abilities to manipulate it.  For the programming languages listed it sounds like youre asking if it'd be better to pursue data or web development, and that comes down to personal preference imo.  You can make a good living in the startup world or otherwise in either.#[deleted]#You should learn programming and web development over data science.   IMO these 2 are far far more in demand and practical skills than data science.   I know you are talking about entrepreneurship, but if job numbers are anything to go by, take a look at the number of jobs looking for web dev/programming skills (especially JavaScript!!) vs job numbers for data science. I'd hazard a guess that its 50:1.  It seems that data science and AI is the hot new thing but the number of jobs/demand/salary points to web dev and programming by a very large margin.  Learn a couple good languages like Python and JavaScript. You'll be able to build things with Those including startup ideas. Can you build a web app if you just know data science? Nope!  Move into data science later if you feel like it. Worst case scenario, if your startup ideas don't pan out, you'll have some very in demand skills and you can get a job in web development or simialr without a degree. Note that, lots of jobs in data science still require a formal degree.  Now I'm not saying data science is not useful (big data is becoming more of a thing) BUT its just way less useful overall than knowing programming at this point in time.#As others have pointed out, you are looking through wrong lens at entrepreneurship. However, to answer your question, unless you are planning to have your startup to be focusing on Data Analytics, you are better off with other skills that will help you **put a product in front of the** **customer**. Data Analytics will come later once you have a meaningful base of customers.  Hope this helps.#Like said above, web development is a much more practical skill to acquire. In 6 months you can bacome a decent one.  Data Science, like any other science, requires you to go through the full academic process, which take many years.  I was in a similar boat to you in January. I tried both solutions for 4 months each, and that’s the impression i have.

If you want to write something more complicated, doing it in C means you need extreme discipline and control, or else risk your code becoming completely unmaintainable. This is much less the case in Python.  Generally I'd say that there are few circumstances where there is more than one valid option in the choice between C and Python. Maybe if it was C++.#If you're looking to start in the industry, i would keep in mind that C is usually used for hardware programming since it's such a low level language.

According to Google Trends these books where written at a time when there was a certain buzz around the topic ([https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=big%20data](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=big%20data)) that has since slowly faded. Since then we have been moving from the ""inflated expectations"" part of the hype bubble towards the ""trough of disillusionment"".So where are we? Have there been any game-changing innovations since then? Are there big data use cases emerging? From what I can see, Facebook has started looking into a dating app based on personal interests. But they don't seem fully committed to transition to a data-centric business model as they also put a lot of efforts into their Libra project to jump onto the crypto hype train. IBM's big data website suggests a lack of innovation and specific use cases. Yet there has been so much theory available for half a decade now. It looks a bit disappointing all in all but maybe I'm missed anything?Also, any recommendations on promising ideas/trends that are emerging in this field? I'm trying to get involved as I see a huge demand in the coming years.";"Big data suffers from having a very poor definition and operationalization. It turns out that simply *having* data isn't particularly useful, and most of the value comes from the analysis of said data, which is not a process captured by big data's definition. So, big data has given way to fields that explore the ways in which this data can be utilized, such as machine learning and predictive analytics. These analysis methods rely on the existence of big data, but because everything collects data these days, the notion of ""big data"" being a thing isn't nearly as important as it was a few years ago, and much of the buzzwordiness of big data has died down.#Nothing. Big data was all about how you handle really big datasets, splitting them across machines to get enough ram and processing speed.   Things have changed - big data aren't so big, because ram is really big, due, in part to AWS (and similar offerings). If you've got a huge dataset, you just spin up a massive AWS/GCP/Azure instance and then use your regular tools, which it's possible to parallelize. I tend to use R. so I'd just use mclapply() if I had to. I imagine there's something similar in python. A server with 160 CPUs and 4 TB of ram can be had from GCP for a few dollars per hour ([https://medium.com/@robaboukhalil/a-tale-of-two-clouds-amazon-vs-google-4f2520516a38](https://medium.com/@robaboukhalil/a-tale-of-two-clouds-amazon-vs-google-4f2520516a38) ) and Amazon and Azure offer something similar.  At work I use SQL a lot. It doesn't care how big my dataset is, it just crunches it, sharding it appropriately across many CPUs (and machines for ram? I don't even know - it's invisible to me.)  Thanks to technology improvements, we don't need to care if our data are big or not, it's all just data."

learnmachinelearning;dbdsgr;1569859614.0;/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/dbdsgr/do_zscores_matter_in_machine_learning/;Do z-scores matter in machine learning?;A z-score tells you how many standard deviations a given data point lies from the mean. Z-scores thus describe individual data points rather than an entire distribution. Considering that, it's easy to imagine why a particular student who's taken, say, the SAT, might care about their z-score, because that student is the data point, and individual students matter.But in machine learning, the goal is super big data sets, and at least in my context which is NLP, individual data points matter far less than the overall distribution of data. A data point in NLP might be an n-gram or some feature value for a chunk of text. One data point in isolation will tell you nothing about the distribution, and contains no intrinsic value on it's own unlike the z-score of a student on a test.**So with that background, do z-scores ever matter in machine learning contexts? In a line, entire data SETS matter, but individual data POINTS don't really, so since z-scores pertain to individual data POINTS, what need is there for z-scores in machine learning?**I ask because I'm learning about z-scores, and am struggling to see how they might be relevant or why they're worth learning for someone with an eye to a career in machine learning.;When you have many predictor variables, especially if they differ wildly in scale, z scoring them all before fitting a model can help both with getting the model to fit properly (depending on the technique you’re using) and with interpretation after the fact. In multiple regression, for instance, if you’ve z scored all your continuous predictors, you can directly compare the magnitude of the coefficients to get something like an effect size.#z-score only comes into picture when you're dealing with gaussian variables. In NLP you're dealing with discrete variables.#Not every topic you're going to learn in math will have an obvious connection to application. While you're learning about Z-scores, you're really supposed to be learning about distributions generally. Its important that you have a solid intuitions about simple situations so that you can expand that understanding to the more complex situations you'll deal with later.      I think you should consider that you could create a similar argument about avoiding learning about negative numbers, because there are no such things as negative words or negative probabilities , and you just want to assign non-negative probabilities to positive number amount of not-negative words. That whole argument doesn't make sense when you consider logarithms, but if you don't know negatives you're unlikely to understand logs. So the reasoning doesn't always make sense, in advance.#Depends. In NLP it is less important but when you have lets say a multivariate regression you usually want to normalize your variables to be all on the same scale.

ITCareerQuestions;d4uzfa;1568603702.0;/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/d4uzfa/would_throwing_my_degree_to_have_more_time_for/;Would throwing my degree to have more time for autodidactic learning and own projects devalue me on the job market?;"*I have been studying computer science for 2 years. I am currently investigating whether to finish these studies over the course of another 2 more years to get a bachelors degree or whether to give that up to have the capacity to learn on my own and work on my own projects. I am currently favoring the latter but I want to get input from people more familiar with the job market before making a decision. I will give a reasoning for each option.*# Finishing studiesWhen checking open positions, a degree is required in almost every case. Some mentioning ""extensive experience"" as substitute but I have only worked part-time for a year now, which I guess is insufficient. So far I have had no trouble with studies and have had rather good marks, probably somewhere in the upper 20% range. Giving up my studies might give a wrong expression to potential employers, thinking my skills are insufficient. Further, I would really like to write a thesis at some point.# Doing my own thingsMost of the time, lectures are boring me, possible reasons being:* I'm already familiar with some concepts* the lecture is too slow for me personally* the subject doesn't seem to be of much use for me in the future.I have found that I'm much faster and more efficient learning things on my own. I learn >70% within 3 days before an exam by reading books. Further, having more time available, would allow me to set priorities myself to increase motivation and gain a much deeper understanding of fields I consider important (e.g. Big Data). On top of that, so far I have been doing very well with building a portfolio of own projects and might even consider a start-up - for which I don't see the time or energy when having to focus on lectures and exercises. And in contrast to scheduled education, I'm much more disciplined when I can learn on my own and things I'm interested in.&#x200B *All in all, I'm currently strongly tending for the second option as I'm pretty sure it's much better for me personally in almost any aspect. However, the job market is the large counter-argument and I don't want to exclude myself from these better positions. I think I'm definitely skilled but that might not prevent employers from categorically rejecting me. For context, I'm targeting cutting edge markets such as Big Data, cryptocurrency, IoT and aiming for a supervising position (not being a programming resource) in the long run. I appreciate any personal experience and opinions for consideration.*";My advice or opinion:    You'll continue to regret dropping out for a long, long time.   Sure, you'll probably get some kind of a career going and find some kind of success.   But it will NOT be the same success you could access with a completed degree, and more importantly two more summer's worth of internship experiences.    I was you.   I dropped out of college in 1996 I believe it was.   Still don't have a degree.   Yes, I managed to find a career path that suited me.   But I entered the IT workforce in the era where anyone who actually understood how this stuff worked could get a job.   We get applications from a dozen college graduates for every open position we advertise.   You sure you wanna compete with that?    If you are bored with your current course load, then show some personal damned initiative and have a conversation with your student adviser about replacing easy courses with harder ones. Stop going with the flow and taking the easy-A. You're spending a lot of money to be bored. Are you sure you are as smart as you say you are?    >  I'm currently strongly tending for the second option as I'm pretty sure it's much better for me personally in almost any aspect.    No. You're pretty sure it will be EASIER, not better. You can do what you want, as opposed to what professors tell you to do.    If you are no longer a registered student, you can no longer access formal internship programs.   You'll be competing for full-time employment with graduates who not only have a completed education, but likely have internship experiences on their resumes.    You're going to have to complete on raw talent alone. Your resume will look weaker, because it is weaker.   Your GitHub is going to need to be impressive, and not just a little bit.    > I think I'm definitely skilled but that might not prevent employers from categorically rejecting me.    Some employers will indeed reject you for lack of a degree.   But not all. Some employers will give you a shot.    > I'm targeting cutting edge markets such as Big Data, cryptocurrency, IoT and aiming for a supervising position (not being a programming resource) in the long run.    Cutting Edge Markets == Start-up culture.   Start-ups love drop-outs.   No degree means no student loan pressure, which means lower initial salaries.   No degree means no formal education in contract negotiation, so they can push you around easier.    All in all, you are putting yourself at a career disadvantage.   For what advantage? Convenience? Boredom?    Bottom line?   Can your plan work? Yes. Yes it can.   Is your plan more likely or less likely to enable you to achieve career success compared to a traditional degree path? My opinion? Less likely.    But a smaller chance is not zero chance.    I hope you are as good as you think you are.   Good luck to you.#College just gets harder to finish with more life stuff on your plate. I am working on my degree now, with just about a year left at a decent pace, after multiple tries across two decades. I hadn't had the perfect storm of time, money, and motivation to finish past an AA and AS, and it's definitely taken longer to climb the ladder. Why disadvantage yourself? Having that degree helps you get the interview. Can your resume really explain your projects well enough for an employer to want to interview you?   HR often just look for keywords and degrees, and will weight you against the other candidates when culling a list so the top 10 (or however many they want to interview) get interviews. I've been on multiple interview panels, and the candidates with a degree plus experience have a clear advantage. Plus, it shows that they can finish something that takes time and real effort. Get it while you're young, unmarried, untethered, etc. Finish school before you have much more enjoyable prospects jockeying for your time and attention. Good luck.

cscareerquestions;daugwo;1569759919.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/daugwo/what_university_doesnt_teach_you_about_your_first/;What university doesn't teach you about your first job;I have a job in Big Data Analytics. I realise some people (especially those entering into the field for the first time) have very idealistic views about how their job should be. They **expect**:\- a company will dutifully ensure it has technical expertise and fail-proof systems **before** venturing into Machine Learning (this has been the biggest source of disappointment),\- that all teams will have an amazing repository of beautiful models,\- everyone knows what they are doing. \- everyone will be completely honest about their capabilitiesIt's not completely bad to have these expectations, in an ideal world, all these expectations should be met. But the **sad truth** is, these are often not true.So, to those people who won't stop complaining: As Ray Dalio said, *Embrace Reality and Deal With It*. Having that mindset **doesn't** mean you should think that the current situation is justifiable. It means you should  stop complaining and wishing reality will converge to your ideals. Learn how to work with current reality, and see if you could change it for the better. If you think it's impossible, or if you don't want to try, nothing is stopping you from leaving.;"What they don't teach you is how to deal with people who brush their teeth at work.  Like, what's the protocol when you encounter them at the sink?  I can't help but think that all the particles wafting from my big dump our now being spread into their money forcefully with a brush.  How do I ask them about that kernel module when I just look at them in disgust the rest of the day?  That's where our academic institutions fail us.#A common theme I noticed among entry level devs right out of school is they expect jobs to be a continuation of school. For example:  ""There is zero documentation and no one helps me through the massive codebase that I can't understand on my own! I'm expected to just figure everything out. This job sucks!""  I've seen it in person and the mentality is especially pervasive in this sub. It is what it is, not my problem anymore."

Its known to be one of the most efficient ATX psu's when it comes to power efficiency, A real most have to be honest.     Maybe it would be worthwile adding what type of ZFS you are going to be running on both pools?   (DONT mix the ssd's and hdd's though.. really dont).     depending on use, it might be interesting going striped mirrors... It would saturate 10Gbe sequential (which I expect is the most comon load on bulk storage) on the 8 drive bulk storage.  Ehen used on the SSD's it would also saturate 10gbe it (might even get close with more random loads)     However, I doubt 40gbe is going to give you any benefid.   Your two pool will barely saturate 20gbe in the most damn ideal conditions and most tweaked config. Even then its unlikely. Even your scratch disks would quickly hit under 10gbe with slightly less ideal loads.#Build advice: Your ram looks good, for performance plan on the read/write cache. The Samsung pros in a raid should be fine. Labels on the drive trays will help when trying to find a bad drive. Plan a way to backup your high priority storage, Google drive with a paid account work wonders.   Unpopular opinion incoming. I built a freenas box and ran it for 5-6 years before converting it to xpenology. When it came time to replace the hardware I opted for an 8 bay Synology. Freenas has the tendency to be high maintenance when it comes to updates. I found myself having to fix major issues or completely avoid updates to maintain a stable system. There were times where I was stuck on an unstable box unable to downgrade due to zfs updates.   ZFS is definitely cool and has its upsides when it comes to storage. The filesystem itself leans toward keeping your data safe, but it is a hog when it comes to hardware. Hardware configs that would give you amazing performance saturating 10gbe will need to be significantly upgraded to do the same with zfs."
analytics;d6huvh;1568916403.0;/r/analytics/comments/d6huvh/recommendations_on_interesting_data_analysis_or/;Recommendations on interesting data analysis (or similar topic, i.e. big data) books that I can read on my spare time?;Doesn't have to be very technical but more engaging and just kind of out-of-the-box reads that you found some value in, one way or another. And something that may be more easy to read for a beginner? Bonus points if it's something that is re-readable  something that you often find yourself looking through time and time again.Would love to hear about the title as well as the main thing you've learned from it/why you strongly recommend it?;One of the first books that I got, and that still helps me: Marketing Analytics - Data-Driven Techniques with Microsoft Excel, by Wayne L. Winston.  Some reasons:  1 - It uses Excel. So, this was really a positive thing for me in the beginning. It does not require expensive software, coding skills, advanced math knowledge, etc. And often the Excel formulas allowed me a better understanding of the reasoning behind a method than a powerful software that does everything automatically. A few chapters use StatTools for Excel, but not many.  2 - I like the diversity of content, at least for marketing purposes. Some of the most relevant methods (e.g., regression, conjoint analysis, ANOVA) and contexts (e.g., pricing, segmentation, advertising, internet marketing). A lot of that can be adapted to be used outside of marketing.  3 - The whole book is like step-by-step examples with screenshots. You learn by actually doing the analysis. And I guess that's the best way.  4 - You can usually go straight to what you want. Like, if you want to read chapter 35 because you want to know about media selection models, you can go directly to that chapter, you probably don't need to know or remember the 34 chapters before that.  So, of course it's not the most advanced or complete book ever. But I think it's a very good starting point (at least it was for me). Of course, later on you can get all fancy with equations, statistical software, coding skills, advanced methods.

Does anyone know to what speed it is reduced after that?";Every network in the country (except Vodafone, Postmobile and Eir) is a virtual network using Three's signal.  You'll get better performance by going directly to Three than by using a virtual network - and Lycamobile are notorious as being the worst of the virtual networks.  Three is €20/month. You get 60GB, after this they ~~reserve the right to~~ **won't** slow you down. The actual limit you get cut off at is 2TB.  Eir is also €20/month. You get 80GB, after this they will slow you down to a pretty much useless speed.  Vodafone's largest allowance is 25GB so it's not suitable for you. Postmobile use Vodafone's signal - they're the only virtual network who don't use Three - but they only offer 16GB so they're also not suitable for you.  Also, if you're in Longford Town itself, you should contact Crossan Cable, the town's cable TV/broadband operator.

careeradvice;dbdoiz;1569859196.0;/r/careeradvice/comments/dbdoiz/are_professional_resume_writers_worth_the_money/;Are professional resume writers worth the money and if so how do you find a good one?;TL:DR: Are resume services worth the money and how do you find a good one?Long version: I have about 15 years of experience in IT sales with a focus on big data and analytics, the last several in Sydney with global companies including Amazon and Microsoft.My wife passed away last year, which led me to want to spend less time traveling and making the richest people in the world richer and would ideally like to utilize my skills in the public sector, as government digital transformation and innovation was a specialty of mine.I’ve recently moved back to my home city to have the support of family in raising my daughter but am struggling to get interviews for roles, especially outside of IT sales, as I think they have trouble looking past the position titles.Given I’m trying to make such a fundamental change in industry, I have been considering engaging a resume service to craft a resume move focused on the position descriptions I am interested in.I’ve used a couple in the past, both relatively expensive and cheaper ones from freelance websites, but each time I’ve found that I pretty much have to write the whole thing and then they just thesaurus it to swap out some words and put it on whatever template they use.Are these services worthwhile and how do you find a good one?Any advice and suggestions would be fantastic.;For the record, I’ve never hired a resume writer. That said, the reason I haven’t is that I’ve found plenty of advice via Google to understand what to put on a resume.   I think the better question is whether it makes sense for you to take all the time you would to research what you need to in order to create a good resume.   If you can pay reasonably for it and it allows you to spend more time applying, interviewing, and writing cold emails, then I’d do it. However, in my experience, people who want to hire someone to do it for them are not taking the time to research and learn what goes into a good resume because it takes work.   What you may need to ask yourself is whether you’re paying someone to do it to avoid the intangible cost of not being able to pursue more opportunities OR if you want someone else to do it because you’re not taking the initiative and time to research it yourself.

I will be implementing machine learning techniques within a healthcare framework. I will be given access to public health info (big data sets) and also given access to use cloud computing. Now, for the sake of not wasting the companies money (pay per instance) they are giving me a $2000 stipend to purchase a laptop to use and be somewhat capable of running machine learning code and not use their cloud space until I need to run the heavy duty models. Now, my first thought was to get a laptop with a solid GPU and go from there. Also, I believe I will using TensorFlow so if I want to use the GPU capabilities for TF I need a Nvidia card. Do I really need a heavy duty laptop to run machine learning code for ""toy problems"" before using the cloud service? Or can I just get a solid laptop with a good CPU and not worry about the GPU?";depends on the task really. I'm a data science grad student and mostly do my personal work on google colab and college projects on my lab's aws account. I recently did a project on GANs on my friends' 4GB 1050Ti and couldn't complete it as cuda kept running out of memory, so had to transfer the project to colab. But even colab has it's own hassles, like 12 hrs session, after which it resets. You can even get a Paperspace account with fair amount of resources for 2k if you already have a laptop. Or get a much bigger gpu configuration on your new laptop. But I wouldn't recommend that as you'll have to stick with that machine even when it gets outdated.#Razer blade pro 17 (2019)   It is a slim laptop that carries a professional MacBook like design but with 10x the capabilities. It’s best features are that it comes with the 9th gen i7 9750H and RTX 2080 Max-Q. It’s only got 16gb of ram, but it’s upgradeable to 64. It also only has a 512gb ssd but it’s upgradeable to 2tb.   It can easily handle everything you need it to do for years to come. You likely won’t need to upgrade again for 3-5 years.   My next recommendation would be the razer blade 15 4K OLED with the RTX 2080.

apps;d6scag;1568971373.0;/r/apps/comments/d6scag/analytics_without_numbers_viewing_products/;Analytics without numbers: Viewing products through users’ eyes; Here are two things you’ll hear a lot from product teams:1. A lot of data is needed to reduce uncertainty and get an accurate picture of users’ needs and behavior.2. People working on products understand and know their users well.The above statements are misconceptions, and in both cases, the reverse is true. In this post, I will discuss how analyzing user behavior without big data (debunking the first premise) will help us avoid the unpleasant outcomes of thinking you already know your users (debunking the second premise).&#x200B https://preview.redd.it/88vipkk0upn31.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=b21e3674dec84c5ba58e8d0c20a31a9854492731## First misconception: We need a lot of data to reduce total uncertaintyImagine an infinite sized pool of black and white balls. Your task is to find out the share of white balls. Initially, you are in a state of complete uncertainty. How much data do you need to find the answer to this question?If you take 100 random balls and calculate the proportion of white balls, then you will know the answer with an accuracy of ± 9.8%. If you add another 100 balls, you will increase the accuracy of your answer to ± 6.9%  Add 200 more balls—you are up to ± 4.9%. Another 600 balls—up to ± 3.1%. With 9,000 more balls, you will achieve ± 1% accuracy.Did you notice that the first 100 balls gave us a lot more knowledge than the next 100, and going from 100 to 200 balls had much more impact on the accuracy than the 1,000-10,000 range?Let’s keep this in mind and move on to the second misconception.## Second misconception: People working on products understand and know their users wellThe second misconception assumes we understand the products we are working on.The truth is, we don’t.We are always looking for ways to close the gap between the product model we envision and the actual product we build. To do so, we try out new tools and approaches, communicate with users, conduct experiments and analyze data.The goal behind all of these activities is simple. We want to improve our understanding of the product and users, to find opportunities for growth and development, and to increase the proportion of the right decisions we make.## Viewing the product through users’ eyesWhat was this long introduction about? I want to introduce you to a method that will allow you to learn a lot about your product. It is very simple:*Take a few users and observe how they use your product.*No, you don’t have to conduct an interview with these users. There’s also no need to calculate the metrics that characterize their behavior in the product. We literally need to take a specific user and monitor how she interacts with the product throughout her entire period of usage.How can you do it? If you already have event logging set right in the product, it is very simple:1. Select the group of users you want to study (you will need different users to get answers to different questions).2. For each user of this group, create a sequence of all the events they generate, including the event parameters, from the time they start using the product.3. You will end up with a sequence of events for each user in your product. You can divide this sequence into separate sessions for convenience.You can also do it with the help of Amplitude’s User Look-Up tool.&#x200B https://preview.redd.it/ipuswcvivpn31.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3c8bd79c01e2b2f9fe851e94b266fe2a9e253aNow you have everything you need to view the product through the user’s eyes. Look at the sequence of events and start analyzing it. Take notes along the way.You will observe what the user does while going through the onboarding and afterward, what difficulties she encounters along the way, at what point her first session ends, whether she has experienced the product’s value by that time, when does she retain and how long it takes her to do so, and much more.Now, let’s go back to the first misconception. Studying a small number of users (50-100) with this method will help you find out the following:1. How and why do people use your product?2. What problems do they face at different stages in your product?3. How does the actual usage differ from what you designed the product for4. Which users tend to stay and which tend to leave? What are the differences between them?Another benefit of doing this type of analysis is that it helps you come up with a bunch of hypotheses that you can test/validate through data analysis, experiments or user research.## Case studies of analyzing user behavior through session analysisThe method we described above solves a wide range of tasks, so it can be considered quite universal. Here are a few cases where session analysis proved to be very useful.## Yandex Maps RedesignRedesigning any old popular service is extremely risky. It’s very important not to break any of the existing use cases in the new design.A few years ago, I worked on the redesign of the web version of [Yandex Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.yandex.yandexmaps&hl=en), the most popular online map service in Russia and CIS market with over 30 million users. Due to the complexity and scale of the task, we wanted to make sure we understood thoroughly all the use cases our users have. To do that we decided to manually analyze user sessions.We selected a few hundred random users, manually examined their sessions, categorized them, and wrote down our observations. The result was a table of existing product use cases and their popularity.You might argue that this approach was not necessary, that we could have just calculated the share of people who used the product to build routes, those who checked the traffic jams, or searched for organizations, etc. But these quantitative indicators would have hidden a lot of useful and critical information about the way people solve their problems with the product.It turned out, for example, that different people used the same features and solved similar tasks in completely different ways. And it was something we should have considered in the new version of the product.In the process, we made a number of unexpected discoveries. For example, it seemed obvious to us that in the task “to find an organization on a map -> find out how to get there,” users build a route directly from the organization’s snippet (see the orange arrow in the screenshot).In reality, however, it turned out that only a small percent of users did this. Most users simply copied the address of the organization and pasted it in the routes tab to build a new route (see the green arrow on the screenshot).I don’t know any other way to learn about such unexpected twists in users’ behavior other than tracking their events and examining their sessions. And the fact that such behavior exists entails many questions. Creating routes directly from the organization’s snippet is clearly easier than copy-pasting its address in the route tab. Why are users missing it? Is the organization’s featured snippet overloaded with data? Are users not noticing the button?&#x200B https://preview.redd.it/vn74eyprvpn31.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6680d99c57ba6d78acd2b7eac206799b6902e1d## Finding problems in the first versions of [King of Thieves](https://www.kingofthieves.com/)When creating products, we usually assume people are going to use them in the “correct” way. We design a product in a way that helps users discover its core value as soon as possible.Surprisingly, “silly” users always do everything in their own way instead of the way we anticipate. This is exactly what happened with the first versions of King of Thieves.King of Thieves is a mobile game in which you have to break into dungeons and steal treasures and gems. You can play the game in single-player mode, but the true value of the game is in its competitive multiplayer mode. The key feature of the game is to steal gems from other players to become the wealthiest thief. At the same time, players must defend their own treasures and build traps in order to stop rivals from stealing their treasures.King of Thieves turned out to be a very successful game—but the launch of its first version was a disaster.The game’s retention was a poor 26%. Most players left the game shortly after they tried it and never came back.To understand the reasons behind this, we looked at the user sessions in the way described above. We wanted to understand what was wrong.The core value of the game was in its multiplayer mode. When creating the game’s onboarding, we assumed that we would show how the game mechanics work in the first levels of the single-player campaign, and then players would switch to the multiplayer mode when they were ready. That’s exactly why we made a huge red multiplayer button after all!&#x200B https://preview.redd.it/w3acnritvpn31.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=775a2a7c38efeba6f144b1ced735518e7c4fe300But it turned out that most users simply went through the single-player levels without ever paying attention to the multiplayer game mode. After some time, they got stuck in a difficult level, or just got bored, and abandoned the game.There were few who switched to multiplayer, but in most cases the players saw no difference from the single-player mode. The opponent either had no gems to steal, or he did, but when players completed the level, they weren’t awarded the gem, even though stealing gems from other players was part of the game’s core loop.After analyzing the sessions of several hundred users (the sessions were very short, so it didn’t take us too long), we figured out that less than 10% of users had a chance to experience the essence of the game in their first few sessions. Those who grasped it were much more likely to keep playing the game.Of course, we should not forget that at that point, this was just a correlation—it did not necessarily mean that players kept playing the game because of that experience. Nonetheless, it was a good starting point, and the hypothesis that walking more users through this experience will improve the metrics was worth testing.We could have probably found this problem through metrics alone: We would see that a very small percentage of new users try the multiplayer mode. And in most cases, those who do try do not steal gems from their opponents. But we didn’t know exactly what we were looking for or when we needed to pay our attention. Perhaps everything was fine, and players simply didn’t find the mechanics of the game entertaining enough.We launched a new version of the game in which we walked players through the multiplayer mode in the onboarding and also made sure that when players attack a dungeon, there’s a gem for them to retrieve and they actually get it after completing the level. As a result, the game metrics significantly improved: Day 1 retention soared from 26% to 41%, while Day 7 retention increased from 9% to a healthier 20%.While examining the sessions and looking at the product through the eyes of our users, we found the stark contradiction between what players experienced and what we wanted them to actually experience.## Optimizing the Funnel of adding a flight in [App in the Air](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/app-in-air-best-flight-tracker/id527299553)Here is a wonderful example that Bayram Annakov shared in his [blog](https://medium.com/@bayramannakov/funnel-analysis-investigating-why-users-drop-6cccbbe41968#.d6c2vl77l).  https://preview.redd.it/5fpv3whuvpn31.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d2397e4b7cd3a877827bc5ab4b466f4031c3c5fApp in the Air is a mobile app that keeps track of your itineraries, boarding passes, and frequent-flier programs. The application helps ease the frustration and complexities of finding and managing flights.However, the product team found that 30% of users of the App in the Air didn’t add a flight after opening the app screen where they were expected to do that.The problem turned out to be pretty trivial, as has been the case in many similar problems. The users would search for the name of the airline or airport they sought in their native language—the search worked only in English.The funnel demonstrated that 30% of users churn at a certain step, but in order to find out why, it was necessary to go one level deeper and look at what exactly people were doing at that step.After making sure all the app’s localized languages were considered, the churn rate at this funnel step declined from 30% to 5%.## Personal sales firstY Combinator co-founder Paul Graham has an iconic essay titled “[Do things that don’t scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html).” One of the things Graham mentions is that founders should personally find their first customers and help them onboard into their product, serving as a tutorial manual in a way.Why? Because it gives the opportunity to look at your product through users’ eyes, which in turn allows you to quickly find points your users don’t understand, where they find the maximum value, and what is and isn’t important to them.It is true that this can be labor intensive and not fun at all. It is way easier and less stressful to look at a drop in the funnel at a specific step than to seek and observe lack of understanding in real people to whom you’ve recently spoken about all the advantages of your service.Personal sales work great for B2B products. In fact, session analysis is a variation of this approach that is more suitable for B2C products (though it can also work for B2B). Now you can select the users you need and study them in detail, like in the previous example with App in the Air, where users reached the screen where they could add a flight, but for some reason didn’t complete the step.Moreover, you can also contact these users personally later and ask them the questions you have in mind. This will make the overall picture as complete as possible.## Pros and cons of analyzing user sessions manuallyAnalyzing user sessions will give you a more decent understanding of how people are using your product. This is not an abstract knowledge of how various popular features and conversion of various funnel steps work, but a vivid idea about your users’ paths within the product from the moment they start using it until they either churn or your service becomes a part of their life.Another bonus of such an analysis is making it easier for you to work on new things in the product. Having a clear picture of the current paths of your users inside the service, you can better predict how and at what stage the planned changes will affect them. This increases your chances of making the right decision.Unlike using metrics, this method loses much less information along the way. But, as is usually the case, it also has its disadvantages. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to compare different versions of the product based on the manual session analysis method. You will have to analyze too many of them to obtain statistically significant results. In this case, metrics, cohort analysis, and A/B tests will help you.## Summing it upMany think that analytics is all about numbers and mathematics. In my opinion, analytics should help you to understand your product and answer questions you have about it. Numbers and metrics can help with this and solve some problems rather well, but you should not limit yourself to them. For some tasks, other approaches, including manual session analysis, will do a much better job.Try examining the session of 50 users of your product. If you don’t find anything interesting, you’ve only lost a few hours of your time. However, and I can bet on it, you will probably find a few pleasant surprises.;Thank you for this insightful article. Learnt the importance of visual analytics, although ethically it is a big no-no, specially when it comes to apps with sensitive info.

Hopefully future-proofing myself if I ever decide to switch careers again.I was wondering if there are similar programs/traineeships being offered in the UK, Canada or Australia for people with my background (Biomed MSc or PhD)? These countries specifically cause my foreign girlfriend (non-dutch) wants to a PhD in one of those countries. Tl dr Basically could anyone tell me how the market is for someone with a PhD in biomedical sciences and looking to switch to business analytics? I'm willing to receive a low salary in the first years, as long as I get proper/certified training. Thank you for your time and reading.;I'm in that struggle right now. Canadian medical science PhD student. Look at any major pharma company, biotech company, or financial consulting company. Oh regarding the job market, it's quite good. A guy I knew got hired by BCG straight out of PhD. At a conference I went to they sent reps from a major financial consulting agency to get cross trained in pharma because there is a shortage of science trained people in business.
college;d9uuu3;1569555823.0;/r/college/comments/d9uuu3/double_major_a_minor_and_a_duel_degree_all_in/;Double Major, A minor, and a Duel Degree all in four years?;"Alright hear me out.I am currently a Freshman in University and have been thinking about declaring my major next week. I know it's pretty early but let me explain. I'm currently enrolled in ""The School of Business"", because I don't want to pursue either an art's degree or engineering one. For any business related major there are six core classes, and six electives. While talking to the dean of business, he stated most kids don't realise the only thing separating a minor from a double major is either one or two classes. So I'm thinking about Double Majoring in Marketing and Business Administration. The other aspect is I want to eventually move back to Europe (lived there for a couple of years previously) and to get my Masters in Marketing Data Analytics. My school currently offer a minor in Business Analytics, comparable with big data and data analytics. Thus I'm also considering minoring in Business Analytics, to give me an edge in my Masters Program and to have it on my resumé anyways. Lastly, My school offers a duel degree program where I would go to a university in Europe and study there for either one or two years (depending on location and which program I choose). The great side about this is that in addition to graduating form my University with its own degree, I also would graduate from the partner with my major and a major in European Management. The program I'm currently looking at has a mix of courses required for the Business Administration and Marketing degrees. On paper it sounds wonderful, and when I was discussing the idea of all of this with the Dean he simply asked, ""do you like electives?"". To which I responded, ""no, I would like to be in a class that I know I'm going to get use out of because other wise I don't see any need in paying for it."" He then responded, ""Theoretically it could work out, the challenge would be the course loads, and the scheduling"". By course loads I'm assuming he either means the fact that I would be learning about business functions for 8 hours a day everyday (which doesn't really bother me anyways due to the fact that I love business) or the fact that I might have to take 18 credit hours or overload in order to meet a 4 year plan. Some more info: The school I currently attend has an excellent partnership and abroad programs for the U.S. Currently I pay just under 30k a year to attend, and that is already including financial aid. Thus I ask you, is it worth it to try and do all of this? Looking at the prospect I think I could do it. Yes I realise it would be a real challenge... but just being able to put on a resumé for jobs, ""Major in Marketing, Major in Business Admin, Major in European Management, minor in Business Analytics"" combined with a school from America and one in Europe is really enticing.";Pretty dependent on how much overlap there is between the programs and how much incoming credit you came in with. I’m doing a dual degree+minor and it’s pretty tight even with the AP credit I brought.  Also, consider just how much benefit the combination of those programs would bring. Will a degree in European Management/major in Business Admin help in the types of roles you’d be applying for? And if not, is the extra courses+time really worth it?#If you can do it, I'd say do it. You seem to want to, and it sounds like you're unfazed by the potentially challenging or dull aspects. What's the worst that could happen? Probably that you drop one program and still have an impressive-looking degree. Just remember not to let meeting requirements get in the way of good grades, and that it's okay to be ambitious and still need to take a step back. Also know that your priorities might change, and don't forget that it's important to have time to build your resume with more than just class, and to enjoy yourself.

Looking to buy a new phone. These are my options cause i'm not comfortable going for a bigger phone (hence i'm not looking at Mi 9t) and because in my region, these tend to stand out the most as mid-range phones that are easy to buy.

Not so much gaming and moving big data or something.So far i know that SE doesn't have microSD (not an issue), 3.5mm jack (issue) and front flash (whatever). Galaxy is a bit slower. But i don't know about the software and general camera performance in comparison. Any experience on these?Help :D;Screen is probably going to be about the same.  &#x200B   The jack issue shouldn't be much of an issue unless you like listening to music WHILE you charge your phone.  &#x200B   The S8 is a 2 year old phone, so from starters it WILL have a 1-2 year old battery, which in turn probably means, less battery duration throughout the day.  &#x200B   The S8 being an older phone will probably receive less future updates if software is something that matters to you.  &#x200B   Good camera is a very subjective topic depending on the use you plan for the camera, so you should research image quality reviews for both.  &#x200B   Point is, depends on what you value, and since no one is you, you'll have to decide for yourself.  &#x200B   If you asked me, I'd buy new phone over used phone if same price.

I am in my final data science course before my capstone next Spring (and then finally done!) and it's been a pain of a course. The course is about Big Data, but it feels more like an Operating Systems course I had back when I was working towards my Computer Science degree 15 years ago. I am a data analyst/assessment specialist trying to understand the practical use of Hadoop, MapReduce, and Spark, but all I see in the lecture notes are diagrams and letters that don't make a lot of sense. Has anyone found some good practical examples of these technologies. Secondly, is there a good list of practical expectations I should know when I state in my CV that I am trained in Hadoop and Spark? So far this all feels extremely conceptual.;Tbf, the use-case of hadoop and subsequently, spark, is really relatively small compared to other technologies. The issue I found when I was learning hadoop was you don't really have access to a ridiculously large dataset that would justify the need to use big data technologies.      (also, yep big data does feel sometimes like an operating systems class)  Otoh, if you really do wanna use these, a great learning practice is to use AWS EMR clusters, as these distributed systems are where hadoop lives on. To justify the use of hadoop, you'll need a sufficiently large dataset, and that's hard to find. What I suggest is learning pyspark, and use the built-in machine learning stuff there, so there's a somewhat justifiable reason to use big data technologies. Then just do the processing all on your rdds, the map and reduce methods, (which are all map-reduce operations done on your hadoop cluster on your EMR), do the pyspark ML thing,  and that's it :D#For real world aoplications of the above stack, have a look at network/security analytics: Apache Metron, Apache Spot and combined in a portable format HELK. Ingesting raw network traffic will make you re-question the need for a data lake almost immediately =]

I wanna go more into data engineering/ML type role and I’ll definitely be put on teams that are catered to this area but idk about the specifics of what I’d be working on. I asked them to match up to State Farm but they haven’t so I might try again. (Any tips on how to get the base up higher would be very appreciated as well)Also both are in low cost of living area in Dallas, TXWhat sounds like the best option given this information?;I'd pick State Farm because they are deeply involved in the local DevOps community. State Farm is supposed to have a great stack as well.   Be sure to also look at benefits and PTO. If one gives you a week more that can break the tie.#5k is not a huge difference my man. after a few paychecks you will not notice it.   both are great offers, congratulations. insurance is great, people always want insurance. state farm has a good reputation in my opinion.   AT&T would be a great opportunity as well - probably more technology focused as a whole I would imagine. the opportunity to work as the place that housed Bell Labs sounds pretty awesome to me (I don't think it exists anymore though).

Entrepreneur;d9x7tm;1569571432.0;/r/Entrepreneur/comments/d9x7tm/healthtech_startup_at_their_wits_end/;Healthtech startup at their wit's end;"This is part rant and part asking for advice regarding starting up a healthtech startup in today's day and age. My co-founder and I started this around a year ago. With his extensive knowledge as a certified nurse, we figured this would be a good cause to delve into make our mark. We knew it'll be difficult but didn't know how difficult until we were met with what it seems be resistance from all fronts.We're having problems getting the healthcare professionals on board, even when we've built the product to their requirements. They weren't impressed and wanted more, more and more, just ludicrous amount of features including AI and big data, which we've stressed that it's impossible if we don't start from the basics first. Not only did they refuse to use the app for testing, they left us hanging by the way side.Since then, we decided to move up with the Ministry of Health instead. Surely if big brother likes it, anything goes right? Technically, they do like the idea and is willing to help with R&D on our product. However, that has been all talk, for the past month, then it's all silence from them. Not to mention with all the government red tapes they impose, we're beginning to wonder if it's worth it to work with the government with this product. Oh and they're pretty clear that they won't be funding the project, simply giving ""advice"" in terms of research and the ""exposure"" to the public - so there's that.Now we're debating whether to move away from the Ministry and simply focus on the people instead. I.e. an app built for users without involving healthcare professionals as a start - perhaps we can try again after we've built our reputation up as the goal is to help them with their day to day jobs. Another option would be to forego starting up here and venture else where. Currently we're both working full time so it's probably difficult to travel out constantly. This would be a good way to find investors which are non-existent in this country unless you know some inside people.There's also the problem of monetization which both parties (public and professionals) are reluctant to discuss as it's considered ""taking advantage of the sick"", to quote them. Another hurdle to overcome in order to sustain ourselves.tl dr To the healthtech entrepreneurs of the world, we need some pointers - I feel like we've taken a lot of missteps and don't know how best to approach this. Are we rushing it? Are we approaching this the wrong way? How did your startup flourish? Any advice would help greatly, we're not planning to give in anytime soon but we we'd at least want to do this properly than blindly moving in the dark based on our instincts. Thanks in advance!";I think you're severely underestimating how difficult it is to change anything in the healthcare industry.  Getting help from healthcare professionals is hard. They're extremely overworked. If you're looking at doctors and surgeons, you're looking at people who spend an extremely long time learning how to work the way they are and are very disinclined to change that. And from the organization's perspective, every change means new liabilities.  The government doesn't have an opinion. They want to keep the machine running. Unless you have an already proven and effective way to cut costs or improve healthcare statistics in a cost-effective way that meets all of the criteria for easy adoption. They won't do anything for you.  Focussing on end-users is nice if it pays the bills. But it won't do anything for your reputation with government and healthcare unless your app meaningfully changes statistics for the better.  That's why everyone is talking to you about AI, machine learning and big data. Across the board the goals are essentially:  &#x200B   * reduce workload and/or cost * improve statistical outcomes (fewer deaths, reduce recovery periods, increased treatment success, reduce liability situations and so on) * new measures should easily fit into existing processes. Doesn't mess up preexisting vendor contracts, doesn't require extensive new training, doesn't require unusual approval processes and so on  If you can't even measure the effectiveness of your product, you got nothing on your hands but a nuisance.  There's a reason the pharma industry is ruled by billion-dollar businesses. Introducing new products into the medical industry is a process of years and more often decades of work and hundreds of millions of dollars.  Medical universities might be interested in working with you but they're more likely to expect you to pay them than the other way around. Funding PhD applicants to research your product and it's applications is a workable path forward.

So I'm looking for a switch, I'm around 30 years old, so I hope that's also not too old. Better late than never right?The country where I'm living in now (the Netherlands), has quite a few of opportunities when it comes to switching to consultancy, like doing trainseeships (McKinsey and BCG, but also a lot of secondment agencies). I would like to dip my toes into the business analyst aspects, and focus on how to handle (and apply) big data and machine learning. Hopefully future-proofing myself if I ever decide to switch careers again.I was wondering if there are similar programs/traineeships being offered in the UK, Canada or Australia for people with my background (Biomed MSc or PhD)? These countries specifically cause my foreign girlfriend (non-dutch) wants to a PhD in one of those countries.Tl dr Basically could anyone tell me how the market is for someone with a PhD in biomedical sciences and looking to switch to business analytics? I'm willing to receive a low salary in the first years, as long as I get proper/certified training. Thank you for your time and reading.;Hardest part for you is getting residency status here in Australia. Very few companies are willing to sponsor permanent residency or employ people who are not permanent residents, especially for someone who has no working background.

Please refer to the following content.Due to the iteration and explosive development of the blockchain industry, many predictions will come true. Blockchain technology shocks the traditional financial industry with the ""code is law"", is also eroding the foundation of the Internet world and infrastructure construction.No matter big data or artificial intelligence is based on secure storage, value exploitation, and privacy protection. Especially in the era of data, the ability to handle and process data has become a race among major business giants.Data storage is a key technology, not only is the infrastructure for information retention, but also is a core asset to build business models and specific products. According to the research report of international data company IDC, the total global data storage in 2016 is 16.1ZB (1ZB=1024 (3rd power) TB) and maintains a compound annual growth rate of 40%. The total amount of data is expected to increase to 163ZB (175 billion) by 2025.Storage has become the core market for enterprise service competitionSource: Public Cloud Market Forecast 2015-2026According to the ""Public Cloud Market Forecast 2015-2026"" report published by Wikibon, the global cloud storage market scale will maintain a compound growth rate of 20% from 2015 to 2026, and the revenue is expected to reach $493 billion in 2026. Among them, the annual compound growth rates of PaaS, SaaS and IaaS are all above 18%.Source: The TOP 50 Blockchain Company - ForbesTechnical giants like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are dominating the data market. In China, companies like Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, 360, etc. provide storage services for billions of Internet users and enjoy huge profits, leading to high computing services prices.The migration of Storage MethodFrom hardware storage to cloud storage, from centralized to decentralized storage, storage migration has been the subject of the past decade, and the trend is accelerating to decentralization.Blockchain technology first time raised a thinking of cloud storage through technology and economic aspect that decentralized storage based on the blockchain should be cheaper, safer, faster, and more widely distributed than current cloud storage solutions.In the rise of decentralized storage, we can see the well-known projects like IPFS and Filecoin, Sia, Storj, DxChain, Swarm, ""the first landing application of decentralized storage"" bitdisk and so on.The competition of decentralized storage and enterprise servicesWe are paying close attention to the competition of distributed storage and the potential players, including the high attention projects IPFS and Filecoin and different competitors. Since it is hard to measure the true value of decentralized projects as that of centralized storage companies, we try to analyze the characteristics of Filecoin/DxChain/Sia from the perspectives of commonality, technical features and business models.Decentralized storage project: Filecoin / DxChain / Sia1. Commonality: Decentralization/storage cost is based on secondary market/business model is explorating2. Technology Character:1) Similar blockchain infrastructure of Filecoin and Bitdisk 2) Sia is created based on Bitcoin network 3) The technical architecture of DxChain is “Chains-on-chain” which includes the main chain, storage chain and computing chain.To be more specific, Filecoin aims to build a data storage network with file storage, transfer and trade, however, it’s hard to realize and develop. The consensus algorithm of Sia is PoW which is unsuitable to apply to economical products.DxChain is a storage public chain with complete functions of development, storage and computing. Compared with Ethereum, DxChain adds storage functions  compared with other storage public chain, DxChain will implement data computing function  compared with the development public chain, DxChain combines storage and computing functions. Additionally, the commercial applicability of DxChain is stronger. As a business or a developer of Dapp, DxChain eliminates the time and cost of searching for additional data storage and computing. Moreover, compatibility of Ethereum Virtual Machines and smart contracts, making the whole system more developer-friendly when developers deploying different types of applications to DxChain.Lightning Network improves the storage speed, since:1) Anyone can process the node verification, greatly improved the transaction performance 2) Steady contracts are able to handle massive documentsAs distributed storage systems are used to handle the storage and computing of massive files, high level algorithm is required. Every transaction stored on the chain will affect the chain performance detrimentally. Therefore, DxChain adopted the lightning network storage protocol which allows two parties to complete the transaction offline without affecting the chain.DxChain is more focusing on the underlying architecture of the blockchain storage technology, the design of service performance is relatively complete for business-oriented and customer-oriented. At the same time, the storage infrastructure platform is also under construction, such as AWS-compatible APIs, private clouds, and so on.In general, from the perspective of industry and technology development, if everything goes smoothly, DxChain would be a dark horse in the blockchain world.check full blog here: https://blog.dxchain.com/who-is-the-winner-among-billions-of-blockchain-infrastructure/Dxchain project update no. 35https://blog.dxchain.com/dxchain-project-updates-no-35-09-21-10-04/";For any business to grow effectively and be superior to others, it must incorporate technology.

What sort of training is required for this? I have some experience with computational biology and using “big data”. I’ve been taking some online courses to learn R and learn how to use Python for data analysis. Is it possible to bootstrap your way into a data science position without any formal stats or cs training? If so, is it worth it? I’d love to hear from the data scientists out there.

cscareerquestions;daxyub;1569776941.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/daxyub/has_anyone_done_big_data_mastertrack_certificate/;Has anyone done Big Data MasterTrack™ Certificate ?;[removed];Most of the general consensus is that certificate are useless. If you are interested, you should try to complete their Master degree even though it might mean you will have to take some software engineering courses. (But they, this is a CS degree, not a data science degree, that's why.)     Also the Big Data courses don't teach you the necessary prerequisites (probability and statistics, algorithms, linear algebra, python programming etc...) so you must go in knowing it already.      If you don't pass the class with a B, you lose the $1500 for each course.#It only makes sense if you want to use it as a beginning of their Masters' program.  If you take 3 courses, get the certificate, you are 30% done with a Masters in CS.  So, if you want a trial run in a Masters of CS, and want the Big Data cert for your current job right away, then it makes sense.  But I wouldn't enroll if your only goal is to switch careers to Big Data - then it's probably not worth it.
learnprogramming;d5dgdn;1568704448.0;/r/learnprogramming/comments/d5dgdn/apple_internship_qualifications/;Apple internship qualifications;I've  been applying to a lot of internships lately and I'm feeling pretty  decent about my chances to get something based on my current experience  and skill levels. That being said, I'm still pretty scared by Apple's  qualifications. I've applied to places like LinkedIn, Amazon, Microsoft,  and a few other pretty big places, but none of them seemed to exactly  have qualifications like what Apple does. I know it won't hurt  necessarily to apply and stuff and if I do get the position I do feel  confident that I can be productive and learn whatever I need to. Still,  I'm kinda feeling the vibes that I shouldn't even apply, although maybe  it's just a bit of imposter syndrome.I  think the most scary thing to me is just that they seem to ask for  expertise in everything from web related stuff to hardware to networks  and to mobile development. I'm hoping to apply for mainly the software  engineering and hope to work on some backend stuff or work on research. I  do feel good about my software engineering skills, my math skills,  machine learning, and the relevant stuff. That being said, I have no  experience with any of the javascript web frameworks since I (for some  reason) have developed a hatred for web development so far. I have some  big data skills from what I learned from machine learning, but nothing  focused on that. I know about OS, about memory, about some physical  hardware stuff, but it's just what I know from one of the required  classes I had to take at my university and again nothing focused on  that. They also ask for experience with client server protocols and such  which I do have, but again, nothing recent and big.Like  I mentioned above, I'm pretty sure that if I get the position I can  pick up enough about the other parts to be able to work efficiently on  the stuff that I really focus on, but it's still pretty scary to me. If I  get an interview question about big data stuff, I'll probably not be  super quick at answering it. If I get a question about mobile  development, I'll probably not be able to answer it. If I get a question  about web development, I'm pretty sure I just won't be able to answer  it at all unless it has to do with communication. Any thoughts and any  ideas on maybe how I can fill in gaps? Thanks!;Literally every company in IT has requirements for their open positions that are rediculous.   I think I met 2/10 of them when I applied to the company I am working at. Write a proper resume and motivational letter together with a great portfolio.   What you show and how you act at your interview will mean 1000x more than what is written on that sheet of paper you send in.

r4rSydneyXXX;d9k11i;1569506444.0;/r/r4rSydneyXXX/comments/d9k11i/22m_sub_seeking_a_dominant_girlfriend/;22M sub seeking a dominant girlfriend; Hello!  I'm a submissive Asian (more specifically Chinese) guy from Sydney [Australia](https://www.locanto.com.au/). I've been interested in the whole femdom area/topic for about 3-4 years now and would love to commit to a FLR, preferably in person, or otherwise an online arrangement can work also. A bit about me:  I'm currently 21, almost 22 years old. In terms of my kinks, I'm interested in chastity, orgasm denial, teasing, edging, strapon-anal (receiving), bondage, cunnilingus being the main ones with some others along the side. My limits include findom, scat, blood.  Within an FLR relationship, I think the ideal theme is to allow the girlfriend/wife feel COMFORTABLE and of course empowered. The last thing I would want is to make my domme feel pressured to maintain a dominant composure without enjoying it. As a couple, during the early stages we can learn about each other's limits, expectations and adjust accordingly to have a consensual exchange of power that allows you to feel like a princess/queen, while I learn more about the main, and even smaller things I can do in our relationship to satisfy your desires and meet the expectations that you have bestowed upon me.  An idea of me outside of the kink/femdom domain:  For work I'm a technical consultant, specialising within the Azure cloud space. I work for a company that is a Microsoft Partner I'm loving my job after understanding the expansive capabilities that can be offered by cloud solutions :D In the future I aspire to fulfill the role of a principal consultant within the cloud space, or other domains that have massive technological influence (namely big data, AI and Machine Learning).  I would consider myself fairly ambitious, sporty and outgoing. In terms of sports and exercise, my favourite at the moment is long distance running (planning on running the Marathon in the Sydney Running Festival), swimming and weights. Completing a 100km super marathon and an Ironman Triathlon are two major fitness related bucket list goals that I'm working hard on achieving right now. Outside of sports, I like to read, listen to music (primarily Asian music, chillstep etc.). When hanging out with friends I like eating out, going to karaoke, picnics, hiking and so forth.  I'm not the kind of person who indulges in alcohol drinking much at all, primarily for health reasons and also to the fact that I can't handle my alcohol for shit, so hope that's not an issue to you :p  In terms of what I'm looking for in a domme:  I'm expecting a slow, gentle and easy start into the femdom aspect within the relationship. This will give us time to really understand each other on a deeper level. It will also allow me time to adjust into the sub that fits with your expectations.  Therefore, I'm totally ok with a domme/mistress figure who's inexperienced or simply just curious to test things out. I'd much prefer that than a full on hardcore domination experience right from the start.  Honesty is also highly valued. If there are certain things within the femdom scene that you find uncomfortable, or want to try out, I expect you to speak up, and you should expect me to listen so we can have a proper discussion together on the expectations and limits.  The femdom aspects also needn't only exist within the sex scene. The idea is to make you feel comfortable as the leader within the relationship!  In terms of age preference, 18-30 would be ideal. I'd prefer to be with someone of similar age as me. It would also be good if you have similar interests as me so we have other things to talk and do together outside of purely the femdom aspect alone. Being Asian would also be a plus :)  If this is something that interests you, or you simply want to discuss together in a bit more detail before considering it (those new to femdom, or don't know what it is exactly), feel free to message me so we can discuss it in more detail :D  PS. I'd be willing to exchange pictures of Snapchat during the early stages of communication before connecting through other social medium platforms.;

With your background, you should consider instead biostats with a sub specialty in computer science / machine learning .  Your goal should be data scientist in healthcare or pharma ... someplace where all that biology work will give you a huge advantage. That industry knowledge is what makes a good data scientist . Lack of industry knowledge will make you less competitive for jobs and create a huge learning curve .   Pharma and healthcare, like their data scientists to be more traditionally educated .... data science has been happening in the style of biostats for quite some time already in this field so the addition of machine learning and AI is not a far stretch but you need that solid foundation .#I missed your question as its marked removed.

For a University project on Big Data I would like to try and conduct an analysis on the evolution of privacy settings by users and correlate it with major scandals uncovered by the media regarding data breaches or data misuse. My idea was to try and correlate facebook data on privacy settings and scandals like Cambridge Analytica as well as with a sentiment analysis on twitter regarding certain keywords, such as privacy etc.. The goal would be to understand if people voice their discontent/call for action more when such scandals come to light but also if people actually do something about it by changing their personal privacy settings. However, it seems to be impossible to get a hold of such data sets from facebook.. I'm wondering if there are any open databases with such information on data privacy settings for other internet tools (such as browsers) and if so how to get them? Also for a sentiment analysis on twitter, do you have any advice on how to do it? Where to get the data? Thank you so much;

I’m choosing my modules and I’m interested in both, Data Science(Within the module - Statistics+ a littlle ML) and Cyber Security(+ to learn Computer Network) . They are in the same year category of choosing ‘optional modules’.  I do not know Computer networking as its not compulsory last year and this year of uni) and is ( of course) compulsory if i wanted to choose Cyber SecurityI am equally interested in both sectors. However, which is the better one to learn at University. Meaning, which sector is more intensive(aka hard), as i’d like to learn that sector during my university then self teach my self on the other.I would probably end up doing a masters in computer science however, itll be towards Big Data and AIData Science (Statistics + a little ML) or CyberSecurity(+Computer Networks) Thank you, in advance;Take this with a grain of salt since this is my opinion, but I would prefer data science over cyber security. Main reasoning is that you won't learn anything substantial enough with 1-2 semesters of cyber security to make a career out of. You would need to get certifications and extra credentials (ex: higher education) to make a career out of it. On the opposite end, data science you learn in 1-2 semesters is still going to be useful.  I personally believe Computer Networks is a good class to take since it exposes you to a lot of introductory concepts and helps you gain a working knowledge - even if you aren't going to be actively developing in that field. In your day-to-day job activities, even if you aren't directly developing for networks it's still good knowledge to have.

The thing that kills it is the random access time, which is generally somewhere between 0.1 ms to 1 ms. Memory access times are thousands of times better. You might be better off trying zram first, or pooling this $20 towards getting more RAM chips into your computer.  Some calculations indicate that 120 GB drives can be destroyed in fairly short time. The simple calculation is: if we assume the SSD is based on some TLC technology, it might allow something like 1000 overwrites before breaking, so you maybe you could write 120 TB in total before breaking the drive. If you can write, say, 500 MB per second on the drive, you have 2 seconds per GB or 120 \* 2 \* 1000 seconds of continuous write lifetime. Perhaps it is plenty for you and swapping, but it's like 3 days of writing.  Perhaps the SSD in question tolerates more overwrites, or perhaps you only end up writing less than 10 GB per day, or perhaps memory you want to swap is highly compressible and this reduces the total amount of writing you want to do. It could last a year, easily. Or you could put it into a grinder where it's dead in a month. Both outcomes are conceivable."

Entrepreneur;d6fccv;1568905583.0;/r/Entrepreneur/comments/d6fccv/analytics_without_numbers_viewing_products/;Analytics without numbers: Viewing products through users’ eyes; Here are two things you’ll hear a lot from product teams:1. A lot of data is needed to reduce uncertainty and get an accurate picture of users’ needs and behavior.2. People working on products understand and know their users well.The above statements are misconceptions, and in both cases, the reverse is true. In this post, I will discuss how analyzing user behavior without big data (debunking the first premise) will help us avoid the unpleasant outcomes of thinking you already know your users (debunking the second premise).## First misconception: We need a lot of data to reduce total uncertaintyImagine an infinite sized pool of black and white balls. Your task is to find out the share of white balls. Initially, you are in a state of complete uncertainty. How much data do you need to find the answer to this question?If you take 100 random balls and calculate the proportion of white balls, then you will know the answer with an accuracy of ± 9.8%. If you add another 100 balls, you will increase the accuracy of your answer to ± 6.9%  Add 200 more balls—you are up to ± 4.9%. Another 600 balls—up to ± 3.1%. With 9,000 more balls, you will achieve ± 1% accuracy.Did you notice that the first 100 balls gave us a lot more knowledge than the next 100, and going from 100 to 200 balls had much more impact on the accuracy than the 1,000-10,000 range?Let’s keep this in mind and move on to the second misconception.## Second misconception: People working on products understand and know their users wellThe second misconception assumes we understand the products we are working on.The truth is, we don’t.We are always looking for ways to close the gap between the product model we envision and the actual product we build. To do so, we try out new tools and approaches, communicate with users, conduct experiments and analyze data.The goal behind all of these activities is simple. We want to improve our understanding of the product and users, to find opportunities for growth and development, and to increase the proportion of the right decisions we make.## Viewing the product through users’ eyesWhat was this long introduction about? I want to introduce you to a method that will allow you to learn a lot about your product. It is very simple:*Take a few users and observe how they use your product.*No, you don’t have to conduct an interview with these users. There’s also no need to calculate the metrics that characterize their behavior in the product. We literally need to take a specific user and monitor how she interacts with the product throughout her entire period of usage.How can you do it? If you already have event logging set right in the product, it is very simple:1. Select the group of users you want to study (you will need different users to get answers to different questions).2. For each user of this group, create a sequence of all the events they generate, including the event parameters, from the time they start using the product.3. You will end up with a sequence of events for each user in your product. You can divide this sequence into separate sessions for convenience.You can also do it with the help of Amplitude’s User Look-Up tool.Now you have everything you need to view the product through the user’s eyes. Look at the sequence of events and start analyzing it. Take notes along the way.You will observe what the user does while going through the onboarding and afterward, what difficulties she encounters along the way, at what point her first session ends, whether she has experienced the product’s value by that time, when does she retain and how long it takes her to do so, and much more.Now, let’s go back to the first misconception. Studying a small number of users (50-100) with this method will help you find out the following:1. How and why do people use your product?2. What problems do they face at different stages in your product?3. How does the actual usage differ from what you designed the product for4. Which users tend to stay and which tend to leave? What are the differences between them?Another benefit of doing this type of analysis is that it helps you come up with a bunch of hypotheses that you can test/validate through data analysis, experiments or user research.## Case studies of analyzing user behavior through session analysisThe method we described above solves a wide range of tasks, so it can be considered quite universal. Here are a few cases where session analysis proved to be very useful.## Yandex Maps RedesignRedesigning any old popular service is extremely risky. It’s very important not to break any of the existing use cases in the new design.A few years ago, I worked on the redesign of the web version of [Yandex Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.yandex.yandexmaps&hl=en), the most popular online map service in Russia and CIS market with over 30 million users. Due to the complexity and scale of the task, we wanted to make sure we understood thoroughly all the use cases our users have. To do that we decided to manually analyze user sessions.We selected a few hundred random users, manually examined their sessions, categorized them, and wrote down our observations. The result was a table of existing product use cases and their popularity.You might argue that this approach was not necessary, that we could have just calculated the share of people who used the product to build routes, those who checked the traffic jams, or searched for organizations, etc. But these quantitative indicators would have hidden a lot of useful and critical information about the way people solve their problems with the product.It turned out, for example, that different people used the same features and solved similar tasks in completely different ways. And it was something we should have considered in the new version of the product.In the process, we made a number of unexpected discoveries. For example, it seemed obvious to us that in the task “to find an organization on a map -> find out how to get there,” users build a route directly from the organization’s snippet (see the orange arrow in the screenshot).In reality, however, it turned out that only a small percent of users did this. Most users simply copied the address of the organization and pasted it in the routes tab to build a new route (see the green arrow on the screenshot).I don’t know any other way to learn about such unexpected twists in users’ behavior other than tracking their events and examining their sessions. And the fact that such behavior exists entails many questions. Creating routes directly from the organization’s snippet is clearly easier than copy-pasting its address in the route tab. Why are users missing it? Is the organization’s featured snippet overloaded with data? Are users not noticing the button?## Finding problems in the first versions of [King of Thieves](https://www.kingofthieves.com/)When creating products, we usually assume people are going to use them in the “correct” way. We design a product in a way that helps users discover its core value as soon as possible.Surprisingly, “silly” users always do everything in their own way instead of the way we anticipate. This is exactly what happened with the first versions of King of Thieves.King of Thieves is a mobile game in which you have to break into dungeons and steal treasures and gems. You can play the game in single-player mode, but the true value of the game is in its competitive multiplayer mode. The key feature of the game is to steal gems from other players to become the wealthiest thief. At the same time, players must defend their own treasures and build traps in order to stop rivals from stealing their treasures.King of Thieves turned out to be a very successful game—but the launch of its first version was a disaster.The game’s retention was a poor 26%. Most players left the game shortly after they tried it and never came back.To understand the reasons behind this, we looked at the user sessions in the way described above. We wanted to understand what was wrong.The core value of the game was in its multiplayer mode. When creating the game’s onboarding, we assumed that we would show how the game mechanics work in the first levels of the single-player campaign, and then players would switch to the multiplayer mode when they were ready. That’s exactly why we made a huge red multiplayer button after all!But it turned out that most users simply went through the single-player levels without ever paying attention to the multiplayer game mode. After some time, they got stuck in a difficult level, or just got bored, and abandoned the game.There were few who switched to multiplayer, but in most cases the players saw no difference from the single-player mode. The opponent either had no gems to steal, or he did, but when players completed the level, they weren’t awarded the gem, even though stealing gems from other players was part of the game’s core loop.After analyzing the sessions of several hundred users (the sessions were very short, so it didn’t take us too long), we figured out that less than 10% of users had a chance to experience the essence of the game in their first few sessions. Those who grasped it were much more likely to keep playing the game.Of course, we should not forget that at that point, this was just a correlation—it did not necessarily mean that players kept playing the game because of that experience. Nonetheless, it was a good starting point, and the hypothesis that walking more users through this experience will improve the metrics was worth testing.We could have probably found this problem through metrics alone: We would see that a very small percentage of new users try the multiplayer mode. And in most cases, those who do try do not steal gems from their opponents. But we didn’t know exactly what we were looking for or when we needed to pay our attention. Perhaps everything was fine, and players simply didn’t find the mechanics of the game entertaining enough.We launched a new version of the game in which we walked players through the multiplayer mode in the onboarding and also made sure that when players attack a dungeon, there’s a gem for them to retrieve and they actually get it after completing the level. As a result, the game metrics significantly improved: Day 1 retention soared from 26% to 41%, while Day 7 retention increased from 9% to a healthier 20%.While examining the sessions and looking at the product through the eyes of our users, we found the stark contradiction between what players experienced and what we wanted them to actually experience.## Optimizing the Funnel of adding a flight in [App in the Air](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/app-in-air-best-flight-tracker/id527299553)Here is a wonderful example that Bayram Annakov shared in his [blog](https://medium.com/@bayramannakov/funnel-analysis-investigating-why-users-drop-6cccbbe41968#.d6c2vl77l).App in the Air is a mobile app that keeps track of your itineraries, boarding passes, and frequent-flier programs. The application helps ease the frustration and complexities of finding and managing flights.However, the product team found that 30% of users of the App in the Air didn’t add a flight after opening the app screen where they were expected to do that.The problem turned out to be pretty trivial, as has been the case in many similar problems. The users would search for the name of the airline or airport they sought in their native language—the search worked only in English.The funnel demonstrated that 30% of users churn at a certain step, but in order to find out why, it was necessary to go one level deeper and look at what exactly people were doing at that step.After making sure all the app’s localized languages were considered, the churn rate at this funnel step declined from 30% to 5%.## Personal sales firstY Combinator co-founder Paul Graham has an iconic essay titled “[Do things that don’t scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html).” One of the things Graham mentions is that founders should personally find their first customers and help them onboard into their product, serving as a tutorial manual in a way.Why? Because it gives the opportunity to look at your product through users’ eyes, which in turn allows you to quickly find points your users don’t understand, where they find the maximum value, and what is and isn’t important to them.It is true that this can be labor intensive and not fun at all. It is way easier and less stressful to look at a drop in the funnel at a specific step than to seek and observe lack of understanding in real people to whom you’ve recently spoken about all the advantages of your service.Personal sales work great for B2B products. In fact, session analysis is a variation of this approach that is more suitable for B2C products (though it can also work for B2B). Now you can select the users you need and study them in detail, like in the previous example with App in the Air, where users reached the screen where they could add a flight, but for some reason didn’t complete the step.Moreover, you can also contact these users personally later and ask them the questions you have in mind. This will make the overall picture as complete as possible.## Pros and cons of analyzing user sessions manuallyAnalyzing user sessions will give you a more decent understanding of how people are using your product. This is not an abstract knowledge of how various popular features and conversion of various funnel steps work, but a vivid idea about your users’ paths within the product from the moment they start using it until they either churn or your service becomes a part of their life.Another bonus of such an analysis is making it easier for you to work on new things in the product. Having a clear picture of the current paths of your users inside the service, you can better predict how and at what stage the planned changes will affect them. This increases your chances of making the right decision.Unlike using metrics, this method loses much less information along the way. But, as is usually the case, it also has its disadvantages. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to compare different versions of the product based on the manual session analysis method. You will have to analyze too many of them to obtain statistically significant results. In this case, metrics, cohort analysis, and A/B tests will help you.## Summing it upMany think that analytics is all about numbers and mathematics. In my opinion, analytics should help you to understand your product and answer questions you have about it. Numbers and metrics can help with this and solve some problems rather well, but you should not limit yourself to them. For some tasks, other approaches, including manual session analysis, will do a much better job.Try examining the session of 50 users of your product. If you don’t find anything interesting, you’ve only lost a few hours of your time. However, and I can bet on it, you will probably find a few pleasant surprises.;
