IAmA;6eg4hi;1496248449.0;/r/IAmA/comments/6eg4hi/we_won_an_emmy_for_our_vr_animation_invasion_we/;We won an Emmy for our VR animation, Invasion! We are execs from Pixar, Blizzard, and DreamWorks. We are Baobab Studios, ask us anything!;"**Update:** Thank you all so much for your questions!! We’re thrilled to see so much interest in our studio, team and projects! We have to sign off for now, but we will be back to chime in and answer questions as our schedules allow. Thanks again, and we hope you all learned something today! -The Baobab TeamWe’re Baobab Studios, an Emmy-award winning VR animation studio!  Our first VR animation, “Invasion!” starring Ethan Hawke, just won the Emmy, with Roth Kirschenbaum Films (Maleficent, Snow White and the Huntsman, Alice in Wonderland) signed on to adapt it into a feature film. Invasion! garnered laurels from film festivals globally, from Tribeca to Cannes. It is one of the most downloaded experiences across the VR ecosystem, and is available on all major VR platforms including Oculus, Daydream, PSVR, VIVE, Samsung, Within, Hulu and others. Our second animation ASTEROIDS! starring Elizabeth Banks was an official 2017 Sundance Film Festival selection and our latest Rainbow Crow, starring John Legend, Diego Luna, and Constance Wu made its premiere at Tribeca Film Festival and Cannes Film Festival this year.  Proof: https://i.redd.it/69a6ctf5eo0z.jpg**Maureen Fan** (Maureen4Baobab)Hey reddit! I’m Maureen, CEO and co-founder of Baobab Studios. I love animation and took a circuitous path to get here.  FF8 convinced me to pursue a career in it (though 9 is my favorite), but my parents told me I'd be destitute if I worked in film and forbade it.  I was UI designer and PM at eBay, then assistant to Zach Braff and Joseph Gordon Levitt's talent manager, then got an MBA, interned at Pixar on the Toy Story 3 production team, then joined Zynga at the very beginning (crazy ride), became VP of games looking over the Farmvilles.  Still couldn't shake my first love of animation, so worked with my friends Dice and Robert from Pixar (and now Tonko House) on Totoro Forest Project, Sketchtravel, and then The Dam Keeper (2015 Oscar nom animated short).  I fell in love with VR when my game devs hacked animation into a headset.  Realized it was the future of animation and jumped head in.  In my spare time, I play Zelda (am a bit obsessive about collecting all the korok seeds) and hope one day Baobab will be so successful that I can ride Shadowfax in my own Shire.**Eric Darnell** (Eric4Baobab)Whats up Reddit?! I’m chief creative officer and co-founder of Baobab Studios. I earned my degree in journalism from the University of Colorado and my master’s degree in experimental animation from The California Institute of the Arts. My first ""real"" animation job was directing a music video for REM (""Get Up"", from Green). Over the past 25 years as a computer animation director, screenwriter, story artist, film director, and executive producer.  I was the director and screenwriter on all four films in the “Madagascar” franchise.  This was a DECADE of my life/career.  Today I'm running into adults who say that the Madagascar movies were a big part of their growin' up.  That's pretty cool.  Before Baobab, I directed DreamWorks' very first animated feature film, “Antz,” which features Woody Allen, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, and Sharon Stone -- and yes, I got to work with all of them!  Woody Allen was amazing, had great ideas and had more stamina that almost any other actor I've worked with.  When I'm not at work I like to ride my electic fatbike, hike, go to museums, goof around on my guitars, watch movies, go to Hanalei Bay and I still play TF2 on my PC -- look for Mr. Peppertree.  Okay, I confess to playing Hearthstone and Clash of Clans, too. I got into VR after my future co-founder, Maureen, put a headset on my head.  VR is definitely something you have to try in order to fully understand.  Well, on that first try I was blown away and together, with Larry, we formed Baobab a few weeks later.**Larry Cutler** (Larry4Baobab)What’s up Reddit! I am the CTO and co-founder of Baobab Studios. I admit to being a computer geek from a very young age, using my elementary school’s PET computer to create Star Wars video games. I studied computer science at Stanford, and as a grad student did early VR research into two-handed interactions with 6DOF input devices (a topic that is now relevant 20 years later). I never realized that I could combine CG and storytelling until I watched Toy Story. So I began my career in computer animation at Pixar as a Technical Director on the films Monster’s Inc.,Toy Story 2, and A Bug’s Life. After Pixar, I joined DreamWorks Animation, where I became the Global Head of Character Technology, leading character development, animation workflow, rigging, and character simulation. I worked on a number of films including Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, and How to Train Your Dragon. I left DreamWorks to be VP of Solutions at an early-stage big data analytics startup company Metanautix which was acquired by Microsoft. During this time I put on a DK2 and immediately fell in love again with the magic and promise of VR.  Maureen, Eric, and I formed Baobab soon after to redefine animation in this new storytelling medium.* Website: www.baobabstudios.com* Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/baobabstudios* Twitter: www.twitter.com/baobabstudios* Instagram: www.instagram.com/baobabstudios* Invasion! 360 Full Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ0fKW5PttM* Asteroids!

Does she act like she's the princess of the universe?#Hi Baobab! Love the work you've done so far. Any plans to expand on interaction in future titles or do you prefer the viewer-as-passive-observer role?  Followup: Interactive story VS passive story, is there a difference in difficulty to keep the viewers attention?#Do you play TF2?  Well crap, the original question was ""Do you play TF2?"" then I changed to it ""Favourite Movie?"" And I got an answer for the TF2 Question, oh well both questions are still open.#Film has always been a community experience-- people in a room sharing a movie together. Do you envision any way that VR films such as yours can be community events as well?#Hi! Thanks for doing this. Any advice for people who don't work in the most creative fields to be more creative at their work or life? Think your jobs sound amazing.#When can home VR owners experience Asteroids! and Rainbow Crow? No offense, and not to sound too entitled, but it sort of makes me wonder why I bought a VR headset when I have to wait months to see the good stuff. Can you please help me understand why we have to wait?#Any secrets to getting a foot in a door? I do 3d modeling/animation, and it seems like everyone wants experience, but nobody wants to give it! I absolutely love it and feel like I can really tell some awesome stories, but need a chance!!#Baobabs! Like the tree? Like in The Little Prince? Any correlation?#What movie always makes you cry? The movies you guys have worked on make me real nostalgic! Must be great to know the impact you've had on people. Also any current film recs?#Not VR specific. Some digital storytelling seems to suffer in end product with storytelling issues that were likely noticed in assembly or the editing room. How do you get around this? What is the turnaround time on a new scene or edit modeling and rendering vs a live action media's reshoot? Has it gotten much better over the past few years? Do you see this being reduced or will most improvements in technology likely go to quality rather then turnaround and rendering time for the foreseeable future?#Hey! Thanks for doing this AMA! You guys inspired me to start a little indie VR Animation studio: http://studiodisrupt.tv/ You all are truly paving the way :)   Where do you see the medium heading as the VR industry continues to mature? Longer/Shorter form content? Interactive/Passive?   Additionally, how are you guys positioning yourselves to be a profitable studio while the market is still small? #What is the best thing a director can do for you on set? :~) Thank you!#What is a project you always wanted to do but never came to fruition?#What is the very best cheese? #Are there any VR development courses or books you would recommend?#Would you guys read my book if I sent you a free copy? :D#what do you think of the situation in venezuela?#Where do you get your patience for working in Animation?#What was it like working with Ethan Hawke? :~)#I'm a sound designer and have worked on a couple animations and a few games.  Can you speak at all to what it's like dealing with audio in VR?  Does Baobab source out their audio work to other studios?  Any advice to somebody trying to get out of freelancing gigs and get a steady job?  (realizing this might not be appropriate for this discussion... buuut i'm hitting enter just in case ;) ).#I love what you guys are doing! Can I come work for you? #This is a question for the whole panel: seeing how far we've come technology wise in the past 20 years, where does that leave you in terms of the whole 'pineapple on pizza' debate? #Who gets to keep the Emmy?#Did any of you actually work on this game beyond going to meetings about it?  #what is the strangest expense you've gotten a tax write-off for in running or creating a studio? what is the most boring part of establishing a studio that can't be outsourced (or for whatever reason, you decided to DIY)?#What 2D/ 3D animated films have you watched that have professionally or personally inspired you? Mine is ""Your Name,"" to name one! :~)#Have you played Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls or Until Dawn?  Do you think it would be possible to have an interactive VR-Movie that works like that and would you like to do it?#Would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses, or one horse sized duck?#Have you worked on HTTYD? I'm a **huge** fan of the series, and can't wait for the third 😊#How did you guys come up with the name Baobab?#Love the diverse representation in your work! What are your thoughts on how VR might push more diversity in media?#Congratuwelldone on your Emmy! Stupid question but: does VR have any negative effects on a person's eyes? #Hey there, loved Invasion! I'm a film student who also happens to be obsessed with VR. What is your take on the future of VR as a medium for cinema and television? What kind of content do you think it will take to push VR to the forefront of mainstream consumer media -- or would greatly broadening it's potential audience prove to be detrimental for the kinds of experiences one could fit inside of a VR headset? (These are questions I think about on the daily.)#We seem to be seeing a whole lot sequels now. When can we expect some truly new movies and ideas?#[deleted]#Hey guys!   My girlfriend LOVES Invasion! on the PSVR.   She has made me watch it over 12 times now.      Her question is:   ""When do we get more?!""      My question is:   ""Can you please say, 'NEVER!' ?""      Hahaha.   Thanks for the AMA!!#Your all time favourite deck in Hearthstone and why? :)#A question mainly for Larry -  I'm a Character TD that graduated with a degree in animation last year and has been working for a small animation studio as a pipeline and rigging TD since then. I'm stuck in a small area without very much animation work for the next two years while my wife finishes her master's degree, so I'm curious what skills you'd recommend developing in the meantime. In other words, what skills really get you attention when you see them in a TD demoreel? Ideally, I'd like to be working for Disney or Pixar as soon as possible so I have somewhere stable to raise a family, if that affects the skills you'd recommend. Thanks!#Now you guys know know how NBA/NHL players feel showing up at the Olympics. Was this a goal or did it just happen? #How do you go about creating the initial storyboards for a VR movie experience?  If you have rough sketch 2d drawings in a comic panel for a 2d animation, how do you get all your ideas down for the rough idea of where everything will go and how it will move and interact in all dimensions before committing to the time consuming animation for VR?  I imagine that unlike an actual movie where the viewer is looking at the scene from a distance, in VR the viewer is in the middle of the action with stuff happening on all sides.  Some movies are written very intricately where a small detail can be extremely meaningful (example:  origami crane from Blade Runner).  Do you think VR movies will introduce an entirely new layer to movies where key hidden story elements might be ""hidden"" around the environment so multiple watches will lead to previously unseen revelations as the movie goer watches at different angles?#Why is it taking so long for the Incredibles Part 2 to come out?#Are y'all hiring?#What do you think of VR pornagraphy?#Hello all!  I enjoyed Invasion! and quite fancied the over-the-top cuteness!  I have one question that has been bugging me since I saw it and I've been wondering your opinions on it.  My question is about why the user is made to appear as a bunny. When I viewed it on my HTC Vive, while it was cute to look down and see my fluffy belly, it honestly more frustrated me that I couldn't actually do anything in the world that I was now a part of. What made it worse was the fact that other characters acknowledged me, but I couldn't respond to them, and I felt very powerless.    What are you thoughts on this and do you have any plans to address these types of issues going forward?  Thanks!  Keep up the good work!#How much did user data influence your design, if at all? What kind of user data is available to you in VR? #Outside of your work, do you guys do any ""traditional"" art like painting, drawing etc. as a hobby? Love your work!#[deleted]#You all have impressive achievements under your belt!  Do you guys feel that VR is an interesting and exploitable niche, or the future of entertainment?  Congrats on the Emmy! #[deleted]#What does Baobab actually mean, if anything at all?#Hi! What software do you use to create your content?#[deleted]#Thanks for the great experience. As someone who wants VR to really be huge, and successful, It to me doesn't feel like it's taking off. What are some challenges with pushing VR towards the future, and getting more support from larger companies with deep pockets? What are your goals, and how do you plan to be successful with VR being your niche?#Which Disney character do you identify the most with?#A Baobab is like a tree right? Like from Madagascar?#What is the story of your name? #Why did you choose the name Baobab Studios? Is it because baobab juice is so delicious?#But if the baobab has no leaves, how can it photosynthesize?!#For the group:  What early games, animators (or animations) inspired your love of the art?    In the last 40 years of interactive storytelling in video games, technological limitations have helped define the parameters for the length & depth of storylines and characters.  In the modern era of gaming, as those limitations seem to evaporate, designers (in 2&3 dimensions) will be challenged to create innovative ways to tell compelling stories.  In these early days of VR & AR, what limitations do you think will help to define the next generation of interactive & collaborative storytelling? #I got one, er maybe a combo   Having just bought the PS VR and experiencing how vastly different VR is, can you see it becoming our next leap in Media entertainment (games movies etc)  Next question where can I get that movie to watch on my PSVR?#Hi! I love animated movies and I often doodle and draw a bunch of random things. what is a great way for people like me to get started in the world of animation? And also what's your favorite food? #What is the best advice you could give someone in their adult life who has no animation experience/education but is looking for somewhere to start? #where's the bunny from??#Congratulations on your success!   With all the advancements in your field over the last years, isn't it getting more and more difficult to learn how to do what you do? Does this slow down further advanced, because it's getting too difficult to learn all the new things?   Or are things merely changing with new methods and technologies, while things aren't getting much more complicated? #I belong to an organization called the National Stereoscopic Association. We are fans of anything Stereoscopic from turn of the century stereoscopes to View-Master to VR. We struggle to get the VR folks engaged though. Any ideas on how to get them interested?  We have conversations every year (California 3Dcon this year) and their is SOME VR but not much.#[deleted]#As your time as executives at these other companies were you personally involved in (the now exposed) collusion between these companies to artificially suppress industry wages?#the PSVR version of Invasion! is my favourite VR app on the PS4... and i have a question about an idea i got from it...  I noticed in Invasion! on PSVR when you look down, you see a bunny body. I think this feeling of ""looking down and seeing someone else's body"" is such an interesting one that i wonder... **Could the virtual bunny-body experience in the PSVR Invasion! app be expanded into a body-identity exploration app?**  If people considering gender-transition surgery could look down and see a gender-switched body that they customized to look like themself (using something like the Saints Row character creation mode) i think it would possibly help them figure out whether they really wanna go thru with the procedure.  Same thing with people who consider themselves ""furries"" who wanna see what it would feel like to actually be an anthropomorphic animal and are considering whether they want to invest in a ""fursuit"".  or just anyone who wants relief from their body dysmorphia.  It wouldn't even need full motion controls, maybe just the head movement possibly combined with optional arm-tracking via the PS Move controller?  what do you think?#Why ain't y'all make over the hedge 2?#Hi! I'm looking for a career in animation/video game development but I'm concerned about the artistic aspects and the fear that I won't be good enough. How do you get over those things to just make the art that you love to make?

By the great depression, about 25% of prices changed about once a year, 25% once a month, 25% change frequently and then the rest in between.  Price flexibility remains inversely related to quantity flexibility.   Industrial products have displayed horizontal cost curves for 100 some years.   Capacity utilization has topped 90% only a couple times over the last 70 years--it averages 77% now.  The US has run twin deficits since the 80s.  Leontief demonstrated FPE didn't equalize in intl trade & 'dark matter' is still posited to explain persistent differences.   Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu demonstrated that the conditions of stable & unique equilibrium are overly restrictive in practice & market design research shows that convergence & the law of one price obtains under only herculean assumptions.  It strains credulity to claim that there was a mythical period of free competition. Even in the 1800s when prices were flexible--slavery existed the first half of the century and protectionism was practiced the entire century (some of the highest tariffs in the world), demonstrating that even internal competition was protected from global competition.

Thank you /u/kishi for arranging this AMA and the /r/startup sub-reddit for allowing this AMA to be hosted here.In addition, I've asked /r/CyberByte to join us. He is a very intelligent and knowledgeable AI student/researcher and will lend us more technical information and business cases that I won't know. AI is a huge field. He recently was asked by others and myself to join the /r/artificial moderation team and he has accepted and we are all very pleased about it.**Some AI Definitions*** **ML (Machine Learning)** ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)) - Is the sub-field of computer science that, according to Arthur Samuel in 1959, gives ""computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.""

It might be worth looking at.**What AI Can/Can't Do**Quick AI + Human Relation OverviewHumans have a few factors in what we use to compute information. For instance we can only hold around 7 +/-2 data points at once within our mind such as tracking roughly 7 +/-2 people in a video. ([more about the ""magical number""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two))Humans also have a limited mental framerate/processing rate that a computer can blow out of the water. Humans can only remember x amount of data points at one time unless you have a very very special brain like that one guy that looks at a landscape, looks away, and then paints a photo-realistic replica of that scene.So a computer can basically just do way way more of what a person can do as the factors can be increased in ability. Like you are getting at though, it isn't magic, it's just more of what a human can do in various aspects. More sample sets, etc.The current state of ML is basically heavy duty stereotyping which is basically a thing called Prototype Theory in action using powerful statistical modeling which is what the subconscious of a person generally does without the person being aware of how that data is all being processed. Basically, current weak AI and the possible/eventual strong AI systems are not magic and are artificial representations of various capability levels of human intelligence from the simplest to most complex.Don't get me wrong though, powerful statistical modeling can get you quite far with giant big data sets of information. Current weak AI suffers from the problem of having to be given labeled data to learn from and the more complex of a piece of data, the more likely it is to not understand it well.**Some General Current Uses of AI**In the past AI was used for fun and games literally. They used it to play chess players and tinker with some other things. Now they use it for business and making money.* **Cancer screening** - Can more accurately figure out what images show signs of cancer vs doctors because an AI can scan every available cancer screening info and record given to it when a doctor has a limited number of samples he is drawing his conclusions from.* **Behavior tracking** - See who is not supposed to be in your parking garage/office building.* **Insurance** - Who gets denied, cost assessments, etc.* **Article creation and summaries** - Can create simple articles from data sets given to it such as sports. Other bots are able to use AI to create article summaries. These are even on reddit in many sub-reddits for a TL DR kind of overview. (uses fancy language statistical modeling)* **Recommended videos** - Netflix and YouTube use powerful  statistical modeling to figure out what you will want to watch next based on what you have watched, rated, watch time, etc.* **Drive cars** - Google has been working on auto driving cars for a while and has gotten them pretty good at driving. Other companies are working on similar things with similar success for cars and even semi trucks.* **CyberByte additions** - Web search, machine translation, spam filters, personal assistants (like Siri), ad placement (note that Google does all of these, but they're not alone), product/movie/whatever recommendation, vacuum cleaning (Roomba), Facebook's automatic facial recognition/tagging, etc.   Some slightly less mainstream that not everybody works with on a daily basis like general data mining/analysis and business intelligence (threat assessment, anomaly detection, trend analysis, etc.), diagnostic systems, sentiment analysis (e.g. on Twitter for marketing), automatic surveillance, various simulators/forecasts, etc.Basically, if a project can be done using algorithms, heuristics, and statistical modeling, an AI can do it for you if you give it enough labeled sample data to learn from and you've chosen or designed the algorithms, heuristics, and statistical modeling well enough or correctly.**Some Future Uses of AI**The future uses of weak AI are going to be able to automate the most redundant jobs there are. If it does not require creativity, it can do the job basically. Driving cars (Google Cars), making your fast food, helping you with customer support, etc.The problems that cannot be solved with weak AI are basically anything that requires creativity or understanding human nature really well. Weak AI uses algorithms, heuristics, and statistical tools but without layered abstractions of concepts and the ability to work in any knowledge domain you drop it in, it won't be able to do those tasks.When Artificial General Intelligence comes about however, that is when you will be able to do jobs that require cross domain ability that uses human level processes to operate on those cross domain pieces of information. Basically what people call creativity.It will then be able to take over engineering jobs, science, writing books, music, movies, etc. A video called [Everything Is A Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc) explains a bit about this abstraction to creation process.Additionally, if you'd like to see some views on automation on how it has effected the economy and will affect it in the future see this new video by Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell. [**The Rise of the Machines - Why Automation is Different this Time**](https://youtu.be/WSKi8HfcxEk)**What sorts of problems are impossible with AI**Some problems however cannot be solved with AI. It can't predict things when it doesn't have all the pieces of information that the prediction scenario exists in. It can't tell you when you are going to die or who you will fall in love with or what the weather will look like in 1 year accurately and precisely. If your problem falls into the following cases, you won't likely be able to us AI to complete the task you want it to solve.Three Scenarios AI Likely Won't Work1. Not enough information2. Too many data points - Massive sets of data or massive quantities of search paths to solve a problem will leave you with an incalculable problem to conclude accurately.3. Chaos effect - Tiny minute factors influencing each other to create a massive web of calculations that basically are incalculable.Then there is a P vs NP problem that has a whole mess of information tied to it. Suggest you just watch this video on it: [P vs. NP and the Computational Complexity Zoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX40hbAHx3s)Three P vs NP Problems Examples* Multiplication - linear progression of time/steps to solve and solution can be checked accurately* Sudoku - polynomial progression of time/steps to solve and solution can be checked accurately* Chess - non-deterministic polynomial progression of time/steps to ""solve"" and ""solution"" cannot be checked accurately**What should startups be focusing on, vis a vis AI?**1. Find situations where powerful statistical modeling can be utilized and doesn't require understanding the data like a human does such as biology or emotions.  There are many situations that you can apply AI to, but remembering that weak AI basically uses powerful and clever [algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXaH77B8xg) such as statistical modeling, search, planning, constraint satisfaction, various kinds of reasoning, and even some computer vision and natural language processing, will help. [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and [Monte Carlo](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm) algorithms are two excellent examples of both processes and statistical modelings being joined together to perform tasks very powerfully. Even AlphaGo the Go playing system used statistical modeling but with Monte Carlo tree search to make shorter predictions because of the sheer quantity of routes it would have to predict and check. Just not enough computing power available and is predicted never will be available.2. Like with AlphaGo, any advancements in the actual statistical abilities of weak AI must be modified from the standard shallow level stereotyping/statistical methods to a more robust multi-leveled conceptual abstraction method that has time/processing limits on each branch.  More similar to how a human is capable of doing things without zoning out for a day at a time. You can always go back and check the assumptions made with the predictions so that future predictions will be more powerful/capable.Three key areas to remember to focus on improving and implementing in weak AI: Algorithms, statistical modeling methods, and heuristics. Humans use a massive amount of heuristics to get by and do well.##Question Time**NOTE:** Will start answering after a bunch of questions are asked at earliest and Tues 4pm PST at latest.There are many types of questions you can ask in this AMA. While I'm more of a hyper abstract/fringe AI researcher that goes deep into philosophy/psychology/logic/systems design, you will get more technical coding and mainstream academic answers from CyberByte. I do have some academic answers as well, as that is a bit required to get to the fringe.Quick note about the philosophy bit... philosophy is the source of calculus, biology, psychology, and science in general. The areas I use are about logical processes, cognitive processes, information theory, etc.You can ask some theoretical questions about AI and how it can work with startups/business. Basically if it has anything to do with either AI, startups, or the joining of the two, go ahead and ask your question.---**Bios**>**/u/testmypatience** > Life long inventor (since 2nd grade), mechanical engineer by trade, AI researcher (AGI focus), systems/process engineering enthusiast, philosopher logically and socially/economically/politically.> An entrepreneur (since high school) and business consultant (main focus on marketing and monetization) and sometimes makes WordPress websites for himself.

Questions can start now, and will be answered starting at 4pm PST Tuesday, June 6 2017.#as someone without a PhD or Masters degree in machine learning, there are still plenty of basic tools that are made available for people to play around with machine learning and artificial intelligence.   In this current market and the current state of AI, do you think it's possible for a startup to take basic third party AI tools and build a meaningful, impactful, large-scale startup or do you think it would require having an AI expert on the team?#Thanks for doing this AMA. I suggest anyone curious about learning more read through the links provided as well. The OP's took awhile putting it all together for which I am very grateful  1. What's the consensuses on when strong AI comes about, giving it access to the internet? Will it almost immediately bring about super AI?   2. Is there a strong possibility that once super AI is created, that it will be kept from the general public for a long time due to security threats?  3. Being that we're in r/startups, is there a current possibility to take data points from a large number founders and companies with data points ranging from age, gender, profession, education, location of birth, etc and predict chances of success or failure to a certain degree?#Hello! As an entrepreneur and an AI researcher, do you think startups can effectively market ML to consumers?   Large companies like Apple and Amazon tend to market products as ""smart"" to avoid terms like ML, but often times, startups will advertise ML/AI as a feature of their products. How do you think ML concepts should be communicated to the layperson? Do you think that the ""trendiness"" of ML is a business advantage right now?#[deleted]#What are your thoughts on Apple's newly announced CoreML APIs?

Next 20 years?  As a second question, when I look at medical charts, i realize how many errors there are, from outdated information to flat-out incorrect information (example: often times, a patient with type 1 diabetes will accidentally be assigned the diagnosis code for type 2 diabetes, for example). How effective can machine learning be when it is learning from false or inconsistently accurate information?#What do you consider the next industry AI will completely disrupt? I know this is somewhat unpredictable, but I'm interested to see an example of potential advancements you think will be made over the next decade or so.#What are some use cases of AI/ML in fields of Network Security and IoT?#Thanks for creating awareness for what AI is and isn't!  > we can only hold around 7 +/-2 data points at once within our mind  Since you also linked the Wikipedia article I assume that you are aware of the fact that this is rather incorrect.

OK. Now this is super interesting. Where can I learn more about Prototype Theory? I've always been interested in how the unconscious mind works. I think it is a mistake to think that achieving consciousness is where the risk lies in Artificial Intelligence. It seems to me that we are recreating the same daimon/daemon background processes that run in the mind with the same effect of over-determining outcomes without conscious knowledge of how the decisions were made.#Are there ""business models"" (involving AI) that have a great cost to society, that we should not mention in writing, since an AI could be reading and learning?    If so: How the holy f**k do we protect against them, especially if we really shouldn't verbalize them?  If not:  I have a followup question.   #How would we know if AIs were already active ""in the wild"" online, what would be signs of this?  and are we monitoring for such signs?  What would be the most likely outcome if different AIs with different ethical strictures started manipulating the same objects or individuals online?

ethtrader;6dzdq9;1496051021.0;/r/ethtrader/comments/6dzdq9/a_beginners_guide_to_erc_20_coins/;A Beginner's Guide to ERC 20 Coins;Hi everyone, it’s me u/poop_dragon. I made this comment about ERC20 coins last week in the daily thread and a lot of you suggested making a separate post. I wanted to add your suggestions and start a kind of education resource for beginners. Again, I’ve tried to stay objective, but there is some personal opinion because this is about trading, not just tech. I think it would be really great for people to add any coins or important information that they believe I have missed. This list is not meant to be definitive, and I am certainly not an expert. *Here it goes…*#**Golem*** **Ticker:** GNT* **Website:** https://golem.network/* **Subreddit:** r/GolemProject* **Current Marketcap:** $399,686,778* **Current Price:** $0.484544 (-2.57%)* **Brief:** *From the Company -* Golem is a global, open sourced, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can access. It's made up of the combined power of user's machines, from personal laptops to entire data centers. Anyone will be able to use Golem to compute (almost) any program you can think of, from rendering to research to running websites, in a completely decentralized & inexpensive way. The Golem Network is a decentralized sharing economy of computing power, where anyone can make money 'renting' out their computing power or developing & selling software. Their most current [whitepaper](https://golem.network/doc/Golemwhitepaper.pdf) projects their first release of the product, ~~Clay~~ Brass Golem, in Q2 2017. That’s now in case you didn’t know and [github reports that it is 68% complete and on track for a May 31st release.]( https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/milestone/11) * **Trader Hot Take:** The value of cloud computing can be debated, it is a growing market, but by how much? I have read predictions for [$390 Billion by 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/02/11/global-cloud-spending-predicted-to-reach-390b-by-2020/#6b8bcc9e1085) and some much, much bolder predictions on the Golem subreddit. With any luck Golem will be taking a slice of that pie, but the speculation is how much and how do they get it. Right now the ~~Clay~~ Brass release aims to tackle computer rendering through cloud sharing, which seems like all awful small part of the market compared with other services like data storage. Although everyone has tremendous things to say about the intuition and skill of the development team, I think the value of this coin depends on finding then capitalizing on the right applications of cloud computing. #**Augur**+ **Ticker:** REP – [short for Reputation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCms-snzHk4)+ **Website:** https://augur.net/+ **Subreddit:** r/Augur+ **Current Marketcap:** $238,190,700+ **Current Price:** $21.65 (-6.64%)+ **Brief:** [Augur is a fully open-source and decentralized prediction market platform.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yegyih591Jo) + **Trader Hot Take:** Augur reports that they should launch [late summer 2017.](http://blog.augur.net/faq-frequently-asked-questions/) followed quickly by a bug bounty. If it goes smoothly, expect things to happen. I believe that not only does this company stand to make profits off users, but also the data that comes from group behavior. Big data is an invaluable resource – companies salivate over this kind of stuff. Platform use is incentivized for the user base, so I hope for it to catch on and become successful. Not just that but I like CEO Jack Peterson’s [travel blog](http://travelmag.co.uk/2012/11/tangled-by-mandarin-on-a-love-ship-tour-of-taiwan/), gotta love a good blog. However, they have competition…# **Gnosis**+ **Ticker:** GNO+ **Website:** https://gnosis.pm/+ **Subreddit:** r/gnosisPM+ **Current Marketcap:** $234,769,559+ **Current Price:** $212.54 (-2.01%)+ **Brief:** Like Augur Gnosis looks to establish a [decentralized prediction market.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-94-JDLdiA) Notably, Gnosis is backed by Consensys, a venture production studio developing Ethereum dApps. Gnosis sees financial and betting applications as innovative and envisions a future where prediction markets can optimize an incredible range of processes. Also, with the potential to provide a platform for information sales. [Whitepaper for everything and more](https://gnosis.pm/resources/default/pdf/gnosis_whitepaper.pdf)+ **Trader Hot Take:** I could not find information about a potential launch date for Gnosis, that may hurt their cause if someone beats them to market. However, with the backing of big names, there is a lot of buzz. GNOs market cap is almost identical to Augur’s [despite only issuing 4% of their supply.]( https://blog.sia.tech/want-to-deflate-the-token-bubble-fix-the-market-cap-indicator-d50f7f1e1ec4) In the end though if they are competing, it will come down to who has the better development team. Investors should do their due diligence on both companies and then decide who to invest in. Maybe its both #**Iconomi**+ **Ticker:** ICN+ **Website:** https://www.iconomi.net/+ **Subreddit:** r/ICONOMI+ **Current Marketcap:** $94,977,900+ **Current Price:** $1.09 (-3.58%)+ **Brief:** The ICONOMI Digital Assets Management Platform is more than just a market place for digital assets. We provide the best experience and simplest method to enter the growing distributed economy. The ICONOMI service breaks down the barriers traditionally encountered by first-time investors. With a broad set of unique and intuitive tools for a person of any skill level, it enables users to invest and manage various digital assets or combined Digital Assets Array™ (DAA). The first DAA open for investment is index-based ICNX. This presents a first step towards establishing a network of DAA managers and users. [Financial Report and Whitepaper](https://medium.com/iconominet/iconomi-financial-report-q1-2017-a1b9dff59e2c) + **Trader Hot Take:** Important disclaimer. ICN is the ICO which was a direct investment in ICONOMI. It will not be a DAA, but the coin will be ‘burnt’ which means it will be re-purchased then removed from circulation. This is a way of profit sharing to paying back initial investors with higher coin prices. I have seen posts here criticizing this move because it puts too much faith in the company, they are under no legal obligation to burn these coins. Their later release of ICNX will be tied to a DAA with their digital portfolio. With the PRISM released this week, a lot of people started comparing ICONOMI to this. I think this idea holds potential, maybe it’s the start of mutual funds or ETFs for crypto. However, they need to prove why they are smarter investors than the average wallet hodler. #**Aragon**+ **Ticker:** ANT+ **Website:** https://aragon.one/+ **Subreddit:** r/aragonone – ghosts+ **Current Marketcap:** $59,712,685+ **Current Price:** $1.78 (-7.76%)+ **Brief:** The Aragon Network (AN) will be the first DAO whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction that makes it extremely easy and friendly for organizations, entrepreneurs and investors to operate. Aragon is everything you need to run your company on Ethereum. Cap table, governance, fundraising, payroll, accounting, bylaws. Aragon organizations will be able to be seamlessly upgraded and solve human disputes using a decentralized court system. [Whitepaper at github](https://github.com/aragon/whitepaper/blob/master/Aragon%20Whitepaper.pdf)+ **Trader Hot Take:** With the ANT sale happening just last week, I will not pretend like I understand anything about this project. But as we go deeper down a crypto rabbit hole, I can imagine a use for decentralized organizations and arbitration. How the value of this coin and company relates, determine for yourself. #**FirstBlood**+ **Ticker:** 1ST+ **Website:** https://firstblood.io/+ **Subreddit:** ???+ **Current Marketcap:** $52,005,201+ **Current Price:** $0.607833 (-8.39%)+ **Brief:** [A decentralized eSports reward platform that every gamer loves.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oFZNaI07wc&feature=youtu.be) Play matches using an on-platform token and claim rewards from the activity.

This could revolutionize competitive and even recreational play for just about any game. As an idea, I could see this working for PCs and I wonder if it could even make its way to consoles. Witnesses and Jury systems make the payment process a little complicated, but I really like the Global Ranking and Reputation features.

It enables participants to set up, manage and invest in digital asset management strategies in an open, competitive and decentralized manner. You can invest in other portfolios or have others invest in yours. So far there is only a GreenPaper (technical specs) [on github.](https://github.com/melonproject/greenpaper)+ **Trader Hot Take:** Super difficult to find detailed information about. But from *Smith and Crown -* A maximum of 1.25 million MLN to support this crowdsale and a future one to support additional phases of work. 500,000 are available. 150,000 slated founders, advisors, and corporate partners will be locked and non-tradable for two years or until Melon is fully deployed. 100,000 tradable tokens will be created for the Melonport company to use. 500,000 will be kept in reserve for a future crowdsale.A decentralized hedge fund with lower limits for entering, reduced overhead costs, and more transparent operations. It is not predicted to launch until February 2018, so at this point it is all speculation in my opinion. #**Swarm City**+ **Ticker:** SWT+ **Website:** https://swarm.city/+ **Subreddit:** r/SwarmCity/+ **Current Marketcap:** $16,739,907+ **Current Price:** $2.53 (1.72%)+ **Brief:** In the Swarm City ecosystem users will only be able to transact with Swarm City tokens (SWT) running on the Ethereum blockchain. With Terminal, users can now send and receive SWT directly from their personal contract. Terminal will be the foundation for transacting in future Swarm City projects such as ‘needaride’ and ‘swarmbnb’. [The release of Boardwalk is the second part of their platform](https://press.swarm.city/swarm-city-boardwalk-overview-9a362f19411f) after Terminal and will allow users to make some basic peer-to-peer transactions with SWT. + **Trader Hot Take:** Personally, I am wary of their business model, because as of now, it seems to be recreating existing types of sharing services, but simply tweaks them by using blockchain technology. Especially when the honeymoon phase of companies like Uber and AirBnb are coming to a close and we begin to see that there are in fact downsides to the sharing economy. That being said, the sharing economy is not going away and I believe it can expand beyond just ‘share a ride’ or ‘stay at my house.’ It could expand into microlending or the gigs sections of craigslist for all I know. Maybe some users could weigh in on what they see in this token. #**Singular DTV**+ **Ticker:** SNGLS+ **Website:** https://singulardtv.com/+ **Subreddit:** /r/SingularDTV/+ **Current Marketcap:** $92,031,600+ **Current Price:** $0.153386 (-8.90%)+ **Brief:** Singular DTV is a content production and distribution platform built on Ethereum. The goal is not only to create and broadcast quality film and TV content but also to reshape the entertainment industry into a more fair, efficient and transparent business thanks to blockchain and smart contract technology. The initial project plan consists of several parts – an original television series, a documentary division, a digital rights management (DRM) platform built on Ethereum, and a video-on-demand portal based around Ethereum. Couldn’t find the whitepaper, [but this seems semi-adequate](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what-is-singular-dtv/)+ **Trader Hot Take:** So when I first read this mission statement, I had flashbacks to this documentary call *[We Live in Public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XSTwfdFwIY)* where a 90’s dot com mogul tries to invent TV on the internet. In the movie, the guy is way ahead of his time and is kind of a boner so he fails miserably. But after digging and reading about SNGLS, I stand completely corrected. If anyone can revolutionize something, it is them. I don’t think anyone saw what Netflix would become 15 years ago, and this could potentially be true here as well. Especially in the entertainment and media industry, where there are many opportunities to be had.   #**Etheroll**+ **Ticker:** DICE+ **Website:** https://etheroll.com/+ **Subreddit:** r/etheroll+ **Current Marketcap:** $14,767,192+ **Current Price:** $2.11 (19.30%)+ **Brief:** *From the Company* - Etheroll is an Ethereum dice game which is provably-fair, has a low 1% house edge and no sign-ups or deposits.

Technologies will come and go, but the fundamentals help you pick up different technologies incredibly fast.   My recommendation is to focus on the fundamentals for now then branch out into what interests you. #Web development.  Server-side (""back-end"") or Client-side (""front-end""). Web development has been popular, is currently popular, and will be popular in the future.  Relational databases as well. ""Big Data"" is the bigger buzz word right now but there are far more positions looking for experience with relational databases than non-relational databases.  Web development and relational databases might not be the ""cool"" technology but they are the most employable technologies.#Cybersecurity might interest you - vulnerability research, exploit development, reverse engineering might not be too big a pivot from embedded C.#Rather than trying to teach yourself something totally new, I'd play to your strengths. You're mostly done with an EE degree right? So choose an area of CS that complements electrical engineering. Try and build something cool that uses some kind of embedded system -- maybe hook up a Raspberry Pi to a bunch of sensors and do some low-level processing on the data or something.  To give you an example -- I have a degree in CS and interviewed last week for a large engineering firm's Aeronautical team. The job title was ""software developer"", and it was working on writing software for UAVs. You needed to have a good understanding of low-level system stuff and be able to program in C. When I interviewed, they really wanted to know my experience working in C/C++ and my experience doing systems-level programming on embedded projects. If this kind of thing sounds interesting to you, just do some projects where you're exposed to low-level embedded stuff that lets you apply your EE knowledge, then you can target Embedded SWE jobs after graduating and talk about your past projects and really impress them.#If you have a strong fundamentals in EE and in software we're pretty much always looking for good Embedded developers.  Not as flashy as Web/Apps but the toolchains and knowledge are much more stable and transferable.  If you've got a good understanding of C & C++ programming, interrupts, bitwise operators, using a debugger, and how to read a schematic it's pretty easy to get a job in embedded.  I'd recommend picking up either an MSP430 or an ARM Cortex M core based devkit (<$40) and playing around with it. NXP, TI, and STM all make good low end dev boards.  Software drivers and support varies greatly though, mostly community driven if you're not a company.#Whatever you're doing as a far as software or running anything goes, you'll have to run it on _some_ sort of an OS. And most decent OSes _aren't_ windows. Boot an Ubuntu box and learn how to run a program - any program. Install CentOS and run a webserver (apache). If you've got the time, take a look at the BSD's. Either way, it's necessary to know what you're running stuff on.#Seems like your time is better spent networking than studying a topic that you are only interested in as a resume builder. I'm sure there is a community that's into embedded C programming for microcontrollers that you can join. This will lead to more job opportunities than studying a new topic for you. But if you want to get familiar with SQL, by all means, follow your interest. Just remember, hiring decisions are made by people and people hire others based on personal relationships and recommendations. #Tech moves so fast that you'll have to be constantly learning if you want to stay competitive, so having strong foundation is the best thing you can do when preparing for the long-term future.  In terms of specifics, however, check out the [2017 O'Reilly Software Development Salary Survey](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/2017-software-development-salary-survey). While it's focused on salaries, it has some good insights into where the industry seems to be headed in terms of languages and tools. It should help solve the issue you're having of being unsure where the industry is and will be. As a student I have the same issue you're having, so I don't know how well this represents the industry and I would love input on it, but I thought it was helpful. Good luck!#No one is very good at predicting the future of the software job market but if the IoT stuff takes off, that industry will be built on top of low-power systems interacting with novel IO devices. Learning to program IO controllers, etc could be a nice niche for you.#I would suggest researching into [EDA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation) as it's a field where your EE degree would be very helpful#Oh. They're all hot. Can't go wrong in this economy. But the very best thing to specialize in is anything else. Join the software farm at google and you'll be competing with the very best programmers, grinding out code. Join Intel and you'll be a god. An EE who can actually program is rare, but so necessary. There's three big companies in town that do EDA: Cadence, Mentor and Synopsys. All good choices for an internship. After that, you're golden anywhere in the semiconductor industry. Or you could start at Cisco doing embedded systems, which you can do at 1000 smaller companies, even startups if you like risk. Work on self-driving cars at Google, Tessa and 10 more. You're really spoiled for choice here. Have fun!#COBOL.  If you manage to do the impossible and learn to love that language you're going to swim in money in the future.#Network security. CS Master in this can easily start off 100k+ and will be needed until the end of networking  Or learn some archaic language like COBOL and prepare for the impending skill vacuum from dead or retiring devs (i.e. wizards) who built systems integral to the government, banks and massive corporations#iOS / mobile development has high employment opportunitities. Data Science is very employable. Not just machine learning but Data Engineering also. The ability to clean data for ML / Data Science jobs is more important and you might find this fun. Knowing the basics of Neural Networks is useful but it isn't the whole industry. Web Development is useful and you can get employed pretty quickly but if you want to make more money you should learn a Javascript Framework specifically react along with the rest of the ecosystem. Obviously do this after learning vanilla Javascript and HTML / CSS etc...#Not directly related, but there will be (or already is) a lack of (good) machine learning engineers."

What are the boundaries to our knowledge as a player base?I have a few things that I can think of, and please correct me if I've missed an answer to them, and please comment with any other gaps in our knowledge:1) Definitive vindication/refutation of biome-based eggs. Increasingly I'm coming around that it's totally RNG, but I haven't seen hard numbers.2) Most efficient ""Experience per Time"" for each activity. I tried my hand at a theoretical calculation of this, but it's hard to quantify things like mass evolutions under a lucky egg, where the time spent collecting dozens of garbage 'mons is difficult to comprehend.3) Patterns to Unown Spawns. I've seen a few threads about this, but it seems like we just don't have access to enough spawns to see massive patterns, and the samples available seem to spark controversy due to limited size.4) [Take this with a grain of salt, because I can already feel internet tension] Evolution item dependence on stops. I have seen enough data to be convinced that it's entirely RNG for Evolution items, but I would be open to changing my stance if a big data dump suggested stop-dependence, and I know of many others who would as well.";"How they calculate the chosen team when entering into a gym...#Biomes. The things we know a lot, yet know nothing about.#Chances of encountering a shiny magikarp (as well as debunking the chain catching method).#I wish we knew exactly what qualifies as a curve ball.#The next level of this topic is what tools would assist collecting the data to answer these questions?  A most usefull tool would be something that would transcribe the content of the journal and correlate the events to the GPS history.  Anothere useful tool would be one that can interpret a screenshot of the map display and identify the spawn point locations.  This data is currently acquired by bots. But the days of the bots are limited. We can no longer presume that a bot is experiencing the same game as a normal player. We need to take over recording the data manually.#What is 42 about. #Has anyone figured out exactly what the ""Battles Won"" number is?#A few reearchs that would be extremely helpful if it could allow to replicate the result consitently:  * What are the exact critical catch mechanics ? (probably pure RNG, but who knows ?) * Double buddy candies.   There's almost no research on these 2 topics, but the very low occurences probably make it very difficult to test anyway.   I'd almost add ""movesets prediction"", but everything done so far pretty much points at RNG, and even if there might be a way to influence the RNG seed (trainer name and so on), it's not something that could be influenced thrugh normal gameplay, so that would pretty much stay RNG.#1&4 I think they  Are still open in my book Edit: I think the research is heart and really helpful but I see different I think ... #The better question, is. What we know we don't know?#What rares and uncommons belong to which spawn groups, and where/what define the different biome spawn groups. I.e. Dragonite and Larvitar spawn with Clefables in the higher elevation biome, and Lapras spawns in the coastal biome.  It'd be nice to know generally where to hunt for the various hard to obtain Pokemon. I think this would have to be group effort though...#To 3)  I personally spend my gym coins on lucky eggs and after activating catch pokemon and spin stops in areas that have nice cluster spawns of cheap evolution mons and a reasonable number of poke stops. When there is nothing to do (no pokemon, no stops) I evolve something on my way to the next cluster/poke stop. This way I get roughly 20-25k per lucky egg. It could be more if there were more stops/spawns.#1. I have zero doubt in my mind that egg selection is INFLUENCED(Not directly controlled) by biome of pokestop. However the egg chart is a great help to the casual player.  2. This has been done, but I cant find it lol. Gamepress had one for a while, but I think the widely accepted method is to find pokestops, and lure them up constantly, and own a go plus and spam that while you evolve with a lucky egg, and save lucky eggs for evolving only. Keep in mind everyone has different phones, so some methods will have slightly different results as far as true efficiency.  3. Yeah I am with you on this one. But this should be lumped into biome mechanics.  4. I stopped keeping track of these once I got all my evolves done, evolved my level 1 of each form also, and still have 5 evo items of each just in case. I literally throw them out now. So I am zero help on this one!#Some data for your #4 suggestion.  I work all day on Sunday and always get my 7th day pokestop bonus from the same stop near my work on that day and everytime I get an upgrade, it's quite annoying really.#i'm still not sure about eggs and evo items... i strongly believe eggs are biome biased, from personal experience of course. if we had a way of marking eggs on our bags would be easier to look further into it.. evo items are a bit less biased but still in my home area i tend to get a lot more king's rock and sun stones than in my university, where i tend to get more upgrades and metal coats.."
Cricket;6cja17;1495403871.0;/r/Cricket/comments/6cja17/10_years_of_ipl_an_analysis_of_trends_and/;10 years of IPL - an analysis of trends and statistics [OC];"G'day cunts, benchods, poms, fellow sheepshaggers and all other cricket fans throughout the world. I'm currently writing my thesis, which isn't due until January, so naturally I find as many ways to procrastinate as I can. I've always been a big fan of cricket stats, and I often see the question asked in match threads ""Is it just me or are totals getting higher/lower every IPL?"". Well, I've decided to see for myself, by amalgamating totals for every single game to see what has changed over the past ten years of IPL.A NOTE ON LIMITATIONS: As a human being I am bound to have made a typo at least at some point in my spreadsheets, but hopefully a sample size of 60/78 helps iron out any small differences.#THE BIG PICTURE Among completed games in the IPL there have been:-192,768 runs -7407 wickets-24,077.1 oversGiving us an average:-Run rate of 8.00 (and thus an average score of 160)-Bowling SR of 19.50-Bowl average of ~26.03 (ignoring byes and LB)#Trends##Match totals[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/Idnc31I.png)A slight upward trend is noted in average match totals since 2008. Indeed, 2017 had the highest average total of any IPL. Perhaps unsurprisingly IPL 2009, held in SA, had the lowest average total by quite some margin. A linear regression plotted against this data shows totals increase by about 1.04 a year, though the R^2 value of 0.31 indicates caution in attributing this trend to time.##Match run rate[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/89DKb0E.png)Not strictly the same as match totals, owing to games where teams are bowled out and to games where totals are chased down in <20 overs. Again we see a slight upward trend, though less clear than with match totals with a R^2 of just 0.23. ##Wickets taken[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/KhfzuVZ.png)A very slight downward trend in the average number of wickets taken per innings, although how much of the apparent trend is due to the anomalous SA IPL is unclear. R^2 of just 0.14##Batting/Bowling average[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/S56dPpS.png) Not strictly either batting or bowling average, as it does not take in to account extras, and is instead simply total/wickets. Perhaps the clearest upward trend so far, with batting average increasing by 0.3 each year at a R^2 of 0.34.##Strike Rate (fielding)[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/ysluUq6.png)Again not strictly a graph of bowling SR since it doesn't take in to account runouts. At best a very slight upward trend in SR, though at a R^2 of 0.15 that seems pretty tenuous. ##Average winning margin[Graph of winning margin in runs](http://i.imgur.com/5PtYRWu.png)[Graph of winning margin in balls left](http://i.imgur.com/HZHwAKA.png)Really nothing trendwise as to whether games are getting closer or not. ##Individual centuries[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/URPiiHQ.png)Definitely no clear trend there. Again 2009 stands out as an outlier. ##200+ totals[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/uqthOCB.png)Two things interesting there, firstly, again the 2009 IPL shows up where only two 200+ totals were achieved. Also interesting is how 2008 had the most 200+ totals, in the first IPL, yet had a relatively low RR/match total suggesting a greater variability in scores.##Bowling 4fers[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/2tl9Bha.png)I chose 4fers because 5fers are too rare and 3fers are harder to count... But as you can see, no real clear trend here either.#ConclusionsIPL has stayed mostly the same throughout its ten year tenure (heh). A slight increase in totals, run rates and batting averages might be possible but as to how significant they are, that's hard to tell. All in all, it seems like much of what we think is changing, be it big bats or better bowling, seems to be in our head!That's all the graphs I can think of, but I've got a big data set containing every total including wickets and balls bowled, if anyone can think of anything else they'd like to see represented. Unfortunately I didn't bother recording which team scored what so I can't say how individual teams have progressed over time, or individual players for that matter.Anyway hope this was interesting for ya'll!";Reading this whilst procrastinating in a Quantitative Analytics lecture on linear regression...makes my procrastination feel validated! This is worthy of r/dataisbeautiful, cheers for sharing!#> G'day cunts, benchods, poms, fellow sheepshaggers  Dude I get the insults are meant from a place of rapport, but can we hold off the extremely offensive word there? No one deserves to be called a pom. #Two things interesting there, firstly, again the 2009 IPL shows up where only two 200+ totals were achieved.  That was the year they had to play the entire IPL in South Africa, due to elections going on in India during that period.#Great stuff. Wish we also had data about spectator gate count and viewers count to see how much the increase has been and if losing teams(RR & CSK) has had any impact at all or not.

Corbyn was spot on and visited the right places more or less.The conservatives got their polling completely wrong and their pollsters even ridiculed YouGov for their 'outlier' results.Kudos to YouGov for their MRP model. It seems like big data is indeed the future in polling as voter preferences are increasing difficult to gauge via the old methods.;"The irony is that yougov is a Tory organisation. Many Tory voters were highly critical of it, there was even a joke meme about the 'relationship is over' on r/ukpol. They've been spot on and cusps to them. This should prove to people that there are sources out there willing to be bi-partisan and believe in their research.#I remember people saying this would be a Tory landslide precisely because May was targeting Labour seats#Isn't there an element of the tail wagging the dog in this analysis?  Had the Tories had a successful campaign the ""frontier"" would've been in the battleground they were fighting in. As it was, labour controlled the discussion and so controlled where the battleground was.   #This is what I was worried about before the election.  May would win, but Corbyn would lose well enough that his supporters would feel some kind of moral victory and develop a satisfaction with failure.  Corbyn's campaign did not succeed, the point is to become the government.  He is not Prime Minister.  Instead, as things stand, we have the Tories and the DUP.  It's probably the worst outcome I can imagine."
PPC;6cwo1d;1495565318.0;/r/PPC/comments/6cwo1d/what_my_startup_is_trying_to_solve_for_the_sem/;What my startup is trying to solve for the SEM industry;"Hey everyone,So as hinted in a few recent posts/replies here and there, I'm working on building a startup/platform for the SEM industry. I've been bootstrapping the product since February 2015, and have recently began in-market tests of the technology. First results are interesting.I'm solving for the following problem: Perfect relevancy between user's search queries/intents to ads to landing pages. If you can perfect the relevancy between millions of keyword/queries and ads, you inadvertently should yield higher CTRs/CVRs.EDIT: Hidden MVP candidate feature list, pm me if you'd like to discuss.One campaign I ran sustained a 4.77% avg. CTR with a 23.58% avg CVR. Not bad given that 6,000+ SKAGs were computed in minutes, and little optimization was done once the campaign was launched (so no new negatives added). It did however serve a market/intent where you had to nearly simply click on the CTA to complete the desired intent, it was easy.My most recent test is for an account with 875,000 SKAGs and the results are very different. It's for a brick and mortar business (car repair shop), and this market of course serves a very different market, series of intents, and commitment by searchers. This campaign is requiring a lot more negative management control so that unrelated queries are filtered out. What I did find interesting in this campaign was: yes, people search with very messed up queries that you'd never expect them to search. One of them was something along the lines of ""how much does it cost to paint my 2003 sebring bumper""... c'mon man, Google isn't all that mighty yet to be able to answer that. Our platform would technically be able to compute an ad that would answer that need well-enough that he'd click and land on a landing page which would dynamically adjust itself to answer that need in more detail.These tests and discussions in PPC communities are making me realize that the platform will require a strong form of self-optimization post-SKAG generation. Especially on the side of negative management from search queries + organization of SKAGs between accounts/campaigns + bidding control between BMM + Exact match types.The platform computes what they call a data lake. And it essentially takes away the ability to manually manage a/multiple accounts because there's just too much data (unless we implement granular management tools, which we'd love to :)So my next goal while rebuilding the product again (with better UX in mind), will be to evaluate what kind of mass scale or granular management tools would be needed to satisfy SEM experts. Not everything can be done on a mass scale, and I see this platform as a mass-volume building tool, which can then begin to optimize accounts slowly until goals are met.My next duties are to build a list of next MVP candidate features, and measure whether they satisfy the needs of the market. We're planning to rebuild the technology with usability and scalability in mind next to lower computation costs, and engineer a robust founding architecture for the platform. There will be tens of dozens of services in the codebase, so technology choices our CTO is making are critical for the future success of this platform.My questions to the SEM community will be relating to:* How much account/campaign organization matters vs. how we currently organize data. As stated above:> Managing the distribution of the SKAGs generated between accounts/campaigns. We're generating upwards 1M+ SKAGs which will perform differently from 1 SKAG to the other. The organization of SKAGs will affect account health.* The division between BMM SKAGs which help find new queries, and Exact SKAGs which focus on performance.* Requirements on bidding management (our proprietary algorithms vs. bid management tools provided by AdWords/Bing).* Requirements for implementation of our platform into landing page systems (in house vs. SaaS platforms vs. CMS's etc). Ideally we'd like to build something that can be implemented via API's into any platform, but we understand that in the beginning we may have to build some implementations into existing tools ourselves.* What to keep in AdWords/Bing, and what to bring into our platform (reporting, filtering etc). We don't want to replace AdWords/Bing, but we're afraid that if someone begins to play too much with AdWords/Bing, he may disrupt the economy of what our platform computes. So before we make any decisions on how we'll handle this issue, we really need to speak to the market to understand what day to day tools they'd.I've tried in the past to bring in people to a private Slack channel, but I realized that everyone has their preferences in platforms. Some like Reddit, others like Skype, others like Slack.For the Reddit community I'd like to create a private subreddit and invite anyone and everyone who'd love to contribute thoughts to this product we're building. I'm currently sitting a new account (less than 30 days old), so I have to wait ~2 weeks before I can create the private subreddit (gold member).In the meantime I can begin-with asking some questions here, and gather a list of members that would like to join the high-level conversation in the coming weeks as I prepare the discussion environments.Early thought contributors will get early access to the platform once we roll out the beta.Looking forward to thoughts.Cheers,PPC BrainP.S. I'm currently 30 years old, with an education in Economics. Although I studied in a completely different field, I've been a web product architect since my teenage years. I've developed a series of web businesses ever since (small agency, hosting brand, content publication which has a viral story behind it).The current team in the startup involves:* A Senior Software Engineer from CGI/Yellow Pages with a Masters in Computer Science. He's the CTO.* An AWS DevOps engineer who worked for eBay/Magento.* A Data Scientist who's worked in the advertising industry.* Myself, acting as the CEO, lead product architect and designer.";"Sounds very interesting, would be happy to beta test on a client.   That being said, here are some of my thoughts.   > Perfect relevancy between user's search queries/intents to ads to landing pages. If you can perfect the relevancy between millions of keyword/queries and ads, you inadvertently should yield higher CTRs/CVRs.  You know the Gretzky quote about going to where the puck will be the future? I feel like your premise is built on a foundation in Search that is radically changing. I could be wrong, but I wonder if tech like this will be relevant at all in 5 years from now. For now, it sounds awesome...but here are my thoughts.  I think this might be based on several outdated best practice IMHO.  1. Audience and context (i.e. device, location, previous searches, etc...) are telling us much more about intent than queries and keywords can on their own.  It's time marketers started thinking about message match as fundamentally different than plugging queries into ads and landing pages.   2. Focusing on long tail and trying to solve relevancy at scale - Aside from the lines being blurred between match types today and Google's continues sophistication in understanding the context of specific queries based on other signals, I wonder if it's time to think about relevancy and message match in the context of CONQUERING ONE KEYWORD AT A TIME. Truly analyzing the SERPs and creating experiences that are so helpful to users that they can't help but engage and convert. (When I say one keyword, I sort of mean, one group of keywords that signals a specific intent, at a specific point in the customer journey). If you are gung ho about optimizing message match, you will see more bang for your buck owning one keyword at a time than dynamically trying to be relevant to thousands or millions of keywords.   Outside of the above personal opinions of mine...I think you will run into challenges around budget allocation, risk management, and campaign structures. Specifically, how do you group ad groups into campaigns and focus budget where it can have the biggest impact? Let's say you are promoting two services, one has a 30x value over the other. I would hate to burn through budget on the 1x product that could drive sales for the 30x one. How will your system know how to break up campaigns in a way that lets you optimize budgets effectively?   > Building intents (builder which can compute intentions based on rules set).  I suppose this is the holy grail if you can build something that actually makes sense. Can you give some examples of intents and how you would map the experience to them?   Finally, the biggest challenge you will face is that different organizations have different decision making processes and objectives, and in my experience, structure needs to reflect how the organization will be making decisions about the account, managing and optimizing it, adding services, promotions, campaigns,audiences, extensions, etc... Trying to force your structure on their operations will be like fitting a square peg in a round hole...It won't be easy.   All in all though, I think this is a step up from whats on the market today, and would be happy to test on a client. Let me know when you are open to beta testers.   Edit: Fixed some formatting.#If you could get all those features to function correctly and effectively then it sounds like it'd be a magical e-commerce machine.! (Next feature would have to be production of virgin unicorns.)  Completely above the scale and experience level I'm at, haha. Best of luck!  I'll test consumer usability for you. ;)#So it's essentially a management platform, without most of the management features that the major platforms have (UI and bulksheet management of assets/reporting/from the sound of it tracking)?   One piece of advice is that building out incredibly granular keyword sets doesn't have the same value as it might have 5 years ago. Adwords has been ramping up Low Search Volume disapprovals, meaning that they won't let you serve on obscure keywords even if you have them in your account -- the only way to serve on a random query like ""how much does it cost to paint my 2003 sebring bumper"" will probably be on BMM terms. Behind the scenes, a lot of major companies are scrapping their 10+ million keyword accounts and running on leaner targeting.#Wow this looks like it's going to be amazing! I know it's not quite the same thing but it looks like you're going to be competing with the likes of Doubleclick and Marine which is going to be challenging seeing as though they are already well established names in PPC. Are you planning on being more competitively priced than them? Atleast until you become better established? #good luck on your venture. as for advice, for myself I develop these applications on demand when I need them. Enterprise software is not for me unless there is really some value which I cannot acquire on my own. The end result is always better (and usually much less expensive) if you tailor functions to the exact needs of the account.   For you guys you're writing enterprise sw that you hope to distribute to a wide range of customers and accounts. I would tailor and write applications for each individual account as a service, which probably isn't the best business model 😂. These are 2 different scenarios.#This is amazing! The concept alone is awesome, I hope you can execute. If there's anyway to help or beta test I'd love to support👊🏽#Ahhhh. Now I understand the reasoning behind your recent questions. :) Enterprise level software is a different game than individual account management. :) So, in that regard, I don't know if anything I have said over the past couple of weeks actually holds any merit. I just didn't know the context. :) Now I see why the SKAGS approach is necessary to account structure - It's a requirement for the software to function.   What is the business model moving forward? Are you managing advertising clients purely to build, and sell the software? Or are you an advertising agency developing software? I think that's a key when it comes to some of the account structure, management, ownership/access, and reporting questions.#I'm interested in what you're building.#Are there any PPC people on your team?#As an aside, I am fairly new to Reddit... How can I help with the whole gold / non-asshat private thread, bare minimum thing? Do I need to up-vote the OP question? #Very interesting - would love to suss it out#Sounds like a really exciting project; I'd love to be involved in road testing the product in the real world and providing any feedback to help further develop it.#Count me in! #I'm interested #I was able to create the desired subreddit to move the conversations relating to the MVP candidate features in a private environment. I will be sending out invites to interested members shortly. And if anyone wants to join the conversation, feel free to indicate your interest here.#Update: I assigned ""approved submitter"" status to interested members in the private subreddit I created /r/IntentionScience.#Yep. Wow. Exciting. Count me in. #""We're planning to rebuild the technology with usability and scalability in mind next to lower computation costs, and engineer a robust founding architecture for the platform.""  I'd be concerned about your CTO. Properly architecting the MVP should have negated the need for a rebuild.   ""The platform computes what they call a data lake. And it essentially takes away the ability to manually manage a/multiple accounts because there's just too much data""  Yeah, definitely concerned. With proper architecture, even in an MVP, this would not have been an issue."

datascience;6g4usu;1496966358.0;/r/datascience/comments/6g4usu/how_many_companies_actually_have_big_data/;How many companies actually have 'big data'?;Big data has been a huge buzzword (uh, term) for quite a number of years now.  How many companies actually have 'big data', though?  I recently attended a data science bootcamp with people from companies around the country, and while nearly everyone thought that they worked with 'big data', the company that I work for was the only one with data that even surpassed a few million rows (and even I only use Teradata -- the Hadoop environment is only for people with highly specialized skills).  The instructors claimed that there are only a handful of companies out there that truly have 'big data' problems, in that they work daily with so much data that distributed systems are absolutely necessary.  To what degree do you agree or disagree?;"Volume, velocity, variety (and sometimes validity/veracity) are the 3 (4) V's conventionally used to define ""big data"". Volume is easy to have, as is variety. Not that many places have the velocity part, though it depends on how the data is used in many cases. While I wouldn't say it's only a handful, I do agree that most data heavy companies don't do all that much of the 3 Vs of big data simultaneously. #[deleted]#Only going to speak generally since the other posts covered more specific definitions. I am always skeptical of the people I know who say they work with ""big data"" but are running processing locally on a laptop. In my field, even a 16 node cluster will get bottlenecked easily. At my last job, we had a 400 node cluster and petabytes of storage that was backed up daily#I found that a lot of people who say ""big data"" can still run a handful of mysql tables on a single machine. Hell, my first DS job was with a company whose entire dataset fit comfortably in memory so I could around with it in Python.  More and more though, companies do have datasets the require Hadoop etc. Logging has just gotten easier, storage cheaper, and the tools to query​ faster.#[deleted]#I work for one of the core vendors in this space, from what I see the main problem in your question is that the definition of big data keeps getting bigger.  The biggest data by volume at the moment is machine data, usually measured in low 100's of TBs per day, but easily going into petabytes per day. This still runs into the problem of what is economically storable. Think Oil rig sensors, or all the network monitoring data at a small telco.  Big data can also be difficult data, for example some parts of the insurance industry only deals in low TBs per day but it's all very messy XML that needs to be shredded and analysed a hundred ways very quickly.  Velocity is a problem when you have billions of tiny messages that need to be analysed against other data to do things like detect fraud in banking transactions within a few hundred milliseconds - it's not by volume, but the geographic distribution of the inbound messages and the window for response puts it in a sister category.  So, perhaps it would be more useful to say that 'Big Data' is any data processing problem that doesn't fit in a single databases server  or laptop - what makes it bigger than those stalwarts is not always the same however.#I'd imagine that pretty much any large company/corporation, especially older ones, has at least 10s/100s of gigabytes if not terabytes worth of data.  If they have any efforts in an area like imagery, this can be vastly more.  That said, how much of that data is accessible or intended for any use beyond record keeping may be far less.  Their use cases will determine the systems/databases they need, and usually those systems aren't really ""big data"".  We have particular apps, tools, and analytics pipelines that do require pulling and processing data at scale, and in those cases we do use things like Hadoop, Spark, Cassandra, etc.#In the Enterprise Industrial IoT space, it's quite easy even for a simple PoC to get beyond a few million rows of data when you have sensors & gateway devices publishing frequently.  We've worked with several companies who have thousands of devices in the field reporting data back, but it's more likely that they're just getting started.  So, in our space I guess I'd say about 20 or 30% of companies I've seen already have what might be termed ""big data"" problems.. while the others aren't more than a few years behind and want to avoid issues as they roll out their solutions.  There are many things we've done with our IoT data management platform (http://brightwolf.com/platform/) to deal with the unique challenge of IoT data and it's use in applications, reports, ML models, etc...  but honestly I cringe at the improper use of 'big data' for IoT and those who Hadooop-up unnecessarily.  #A lot of them have big data, but very few have questions you can answer with big data.  For example, I worked at a company with billion-row Redshift database.  I did a study where I looked at accuracy rates for record matching between peoples' names and phone numbers.  I couldn't use the billion rows because the only way to determine if a record was created accurately is to actually call the number and ask (or use voicemail) to figure it out.  Millions of rows but 30000 phone calls.  It became a ""small data"" problem.  Similarly, I was working on a team with a new product.  Over time it'll probably become big data, but when I left it was only about 500,000 rows because we didn't have that many subscribers.#I'd say very few companies have access to big data sets (100s of billions of rows) for practical use out side of Google, SAP, etc."

I'm wondering if any other chemist around (doesn't have to be an organic) uses one of those tools mentioned in the title and what for. In your experience, which one has the most applications in chemistry? Thank you in advance;"Python#Python. Matlab isn't free and you don't want to get really good at something just to not be able to use it when the license expires. Python is free and has easily the best libraries and functionality. Can't say I've ever used maple, but python can do everything maple can do and is free. I believe maple is really good for high performance, but if you need that then you should learn fortran or c++, which are much faster and better (and free). I do all my data analysis in python and I am able to process days worth of data in seconds#Don't know about chemistry specificaly but here are a few things to considere.  Matlab and Maple are both proprietary. It means the source code is closed and you have to pay for it. Python on the other hand is a general purpose language that is open source and free, has a very large community (meaning you can find help easily if you have problems) and is used a lot by data scientists.  I would recommend Python just for the open source part.#[deleted]#So on my end, both. You can make  GORGEOUS figures with python. everyone in my lab uses MATLAB for stuff like image analysis though #In chemometrics, which is a branch of analytical chemistry dealing with experimental design and statistical calibrations, MATLAB and R are popular. Python can be used off-the-shelf to do most things in this domain (and beyond, in other non-chemistry related tasks), but cutting edge packages for chemometrics are often released in MATLAB and R.  In chemoinformatics and molecular modeling, Python is generally considered to be king though some presence by MATLAB and R can be seen.#Python or R. I'm a material scientist and I use Python a ton and it is also a general programming language. I've started learning R because it has better stats and visualizations but python will still be my workhorse language. #MATLAB is easy and powerful as hell#With the examples you mentioned, MVDA for the manipulation of spectra and big data sets then I'd definitely suggest R, it's what I use daily to carry out these tasks. If you want to learn python alongside R it wouldn't hurt. I have numerous examples of using python for bespoke instrument control, and passing data to R for analysis and realtime display. I recently developed a chemometrics course using R that was delivered to the Pharmaceutical​ industry, if you want to DM me I can share some of the content. #For actual data analysis, I recommend Python unless it's the type of number crunching that necessitates C or FORTRAN.  Even then, it's still fairly robust if you use the right packages.  It's also free, which is a big plus.    For making graphs, I recommend MATLAB based on my own experience.  It's pretty straightforward to make appealing graphics with only a little practice.  I can't say whether the same is true for Python, since I haven't learned how to make graphs in Python.#I'm with u/Chemist8751 in that your teacher is overestimating the importance of all of those things, especially with regards to organic chemistry (physical, computational, and analytical chemists are more in need of those tools/skills).  I use python almost exclusively; but I understand the power of Matlab. Another programmer in my lab uses almost exclusively Matlab. You *can* do everything in one that you can do in another. Python is better for general purpose stuff (I had to write a program that automated clicks on my computer to manually extract data from an out-of-data program that would have taken me weeks without python).   Matlab is a little bit better for graphically-driven exploratory data analysis (I use the peak-fit tool and plotting functions for some quick stuff) and is a bit easier to get up and running with some specialized stuff (machine learning).  I'd say that if you want to publish your code, it can be useful to do it in Python, as it's more freely avaliable. If you're just doing data analysis for yourself, Matlab is fine and you shouldn't have too big a learning curve transitioning to python/numpy/matplotlib.  If you're going to use Python, I'd recommend installing Anaconda as it manages a lot of relevant packages and generally makes everything easier.  Edit: A lot of people are talking about making graphs/charts: I'd highly advise learning how to export to .svg and then using a vector graphics editor (Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape) to tailor your graph to exactly what you want.#I think Maple is used for algebra and symbolic manipulations.  A free package that can do similar is Maxima:  http://maxima.sourceforge.net/     #[deleted]"

Why now let big data make our plans for us and solve our problems for us, allocate priorities and directives according to online referendums and AI algorithms, etc. Because they'd tell us all to be communists?;[deleted];"Rule by democracy simply does not work out in the long run due to the tendency towards socialism. Watch the Atlas Shrugged movies. Look up Austrian economic theory on YouTube. A good book explaining this is Friedrich Hayek's ""The Road to Serfdom"".   On an interesting note, leaving out democracy, I think an AI guided system that simply tries to achieve the best possible outcome for society based on data would not lead to communism. The best system ever devised for improving the general outcome of society is capitalism, libertarianism and economic freedom (1). You want very low taxes, few regulations and a very small government/AI. A big government is unbelievably inefficient and slows economic prosperity of everyone as a whole (3).   It is clear that America was better at technological innovation than the Soviet Union. Technological innovation has enabled middle class people in our age to live better than kings a few hundred years ago. Also, looking at most of history almost everyone was dirt poor and more than 90% of the population barely made a living through hard labour on farms. Child labour was the only way most families could survive. Average life spans used to be very low and the child death rate extremely high.   More people have died under communist regimes than even Nazism. Yes, communists killed more people than Hitler. Interesting fact is that Nazism stands for National Socialist party because they promoted a big nanny government that will take care of everyone while vilifying groups of people that did well such as the Jews. Research some of these topics yourself.  An intelligent AI would hopefully look at the data and determine what economic policies benefit society in the long run. We kind of already know what policies work (2). Politicians like to buy votes using detrimental policies where people benefit now but their children end up with the bill. My ideal research project would be to create a software simulation of society where you try out different policies and see what happens over time.   1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtJwAYJ9B08 2: https://www.cato.org/economic-freedom-world 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONATaFzi82I#Will you commies take a damn microeconomics class already. #This is inevitable, but the reason its not reality already is because politicians and bankers aren't ready to give up control.  The closest we can get to optimal independence right now is to use cryptocurrency such as bitcoin instead of rands. It is free from politics as in no-one can arbitrarily issue themselves more.   The next step would be to build systems that manage roads, electricity, education, communication, safety and water costs to be shared by the users on a voluntary basis (because taxation cannot be enforced on bitcoin).

No fear-mongering or anti-corporate propaganda.;"""Big Data"" isn't an entity so it does nothing with our data. ""Big Data"" refers to the concept of using large amounts of data to draw conclusions or direct action. Some company might collect ""Big Data"" about their customers and then try to draw conclusions about their customer base, such as what products to carry or advertise. Similarly selling that data to other companies would be profitable, and buying such data could in turn help grow a business.#Big Data isn't an entity. It's just the phrase used to refer to the existence of comprehensive collections of data, most of it taken from public record or purchased legally from companies you've allowed to have the info. Data brokers develop lists which incorporate info from many sources to create profiles of individuals, so they can sell the names and addresses back to companies that want to reach, say, married women with no kids and a house worth >$100K (or whatever).  Basically, this is all about selling you more stuff, more efficiently. It's not a plot.  There is another use of the word, which involves reporters synthesizing huge public databases to investigate whether public agencies and politicians are working for the public or for themselves.#So think of a company like Amazon. When you buy something on the site you don't just buy the first thing you see. You search, filter, read reviews, descriptions, change searches and so on. Well each of those is an event which amazon collects.   Then they analyze this data. Now for 1 person it's simple. But when you get into the thousands/millions/billions of events like this occurring this get more complicated.   Big data is just the process of storing, processing, and analyzing that data to help you make business decisions. Because if a person bought a washer than they probably need a drier. #They mostly use it to figure out what kind of person you are so they can advertise best to.  If they know you are a parent and know your income and know the age of your kids, then they will make sure you are getting an ad for the brand new toy for your kid's age.  Target did an interesting thing regarding that. There are certain items that newly pregnant women will buy. So if you buy those things, you'd get a special advertisement in the mail with a bunch of prenatal items. They [got in trouble](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-incredible-story-of-how-target-exposed-a-teen-girls-pregnancy-2012-2) a few years ago for it. What they do now is they'll send an ad with a bunch of sale prices for random things with a bunch of pregnancy stuff thrown in there so it doesn't look so creepy.#Computers are very good at finding patterns and correlations (one thing that affects another)  Big data means collecting lots of data on lots of things and with the advances in computers power we can now sort through this data much faster and easier.  #You want to see some creepy ass big data? I have your creepy ass big data right HERE!  https://scout.ai/story/the-rise-of-the-weaponized-ai-propaganda-machine  >By leveraging automated emotional manipulation alongside swarms of bots, Facebook dark posts, A/B testing, and fake news networks, a company called Cambridge Analytica has activated an invisible machine that preys on the personalities of individual voters to create large shifts in public opinion. Many of these technologies have been used individually to some effect before, but together they make up a nearly impenetrable voter manipulation machine that is quickly becoming the new deciding factor in elections around the world.   >The company is owned and controlled by conservative and alt-right interests that are also deeply entwined in the Trump administration. The Mercer family is both a major owner of Cambridge Analytica and one of Trump’s biggest donors. Steve Bannon, in addition to acting as Trump’s Chief Strategist and a member of the White House Security Council, is a Cambridge Analytica board member.  >According to Zurich’s Das Magazine, which profiled Kosinski in late 2016, “with a mere ten ‘likes’ as input his model could appraise a person’s character better than an average coworker. With seventy, it could ‘know’ a subject better than a friend; with 150 likes, better than their parents. With 300 likes, Kosinski’s machine could predict a subject’s behavior better than their partner. **With even more likes it could exceed what a person thinks they know about themselves**.”   >Where traditional pollsters might ask a person outright how they plan to vote, Analytica relies not on what they say but what they do, tracking their online movements and interests and serving up multivariate ads designed to change a person’s behavior by preying on individual personality traits.   >For people in the ‘Temperamental’ personality group, who tend to dislike commitment, messaging on the issue should take the line that showing your ID to vote is ‘as easy as buying a case of beer’. Whereas the right message for people in the ‘Stoic Traditionalist’ group, who have strongly held conventional views, is that showing your ID in order to vote is simply part of the privilege of living in a democracy.”"
linux;6cjvfx;1495410865.0;/r/linux/comments/6cjvfx/bias_aside_would_linux_be_a_better_os_for_a/;Bias aside, would Linux be a better OS for a University Statistics student?;So I'm a university Statistics major, with a CS minor. This summer, I decided to install VirtualBox and use CentOS distro since my upcoming Computer Organizations class uses this distro. After playing around with it for about a week, and learning basic command line commands, and creating some very Basic C programs, and tbh I'm starting to really like linux. This upcoming semester, I'm taking a Data Analytics and Visualization class as well for my Big Data secondary major. It'll cover topics in Unsupervised and Supervised Learning, along with an intro to parallel computing if there is time at the end of the semester (along with data viz of course). All of this stuff will be in R, so I was wondering, would there be any benefit to installing R on my VM and using Linux instead of R on my default Windows 10 OS? Would R be faster with Linux? I've considered ditching VirtualBox and Dual Booting, or even buying a secondary machine (not nearly as expensive as my primary of course) and dedicating it to Linux. Any tips? Thanks!;"The best operating system is the one that does what you want.  You can probably find whatever you need on any platform, but if you primarily use open source tools then using a Linux distribution would do you well because most software is a package manager install away.#Hi there! Statistics PhD here. You can use Linux, Mac, or Windows for your desktop analyses. They all run R and take you to the same internet so it doesn't really matter. If you end up getting a job in statistics, your Linux knowledge will serve you well, because you may end up running some computations on an off site server..... which will almost certainly run Linux!   Caveat: If you need to do some C/C++ programming for your analyses, or get used to writing or coding in Emacs/Vim, then Linux will suit your preferences better.#There's probably not much difference. You can run R on either at the same speed. But running Linux is likely to make you into a more technical person in general, which can be a useful side effect.#You're asking for unbiased opinions in a very biased place. Realistically, you won't see any noticeable difference in using R on Linux or Windows. Personally, I recommend mastering one thing at a time. If I were you I would worry about school first, and then trying out Linux. If you really do want to try Linux, I highly recommend dual-booting from my own personal experience.#If you are only going to use R you can just stick for now with windows.  But with Linux you have so many tools at your fingertips which are not available with windows or are really cumbersome to use.   Searching, filtering, editing files is Linuxs' strength because everything works with files.  Sure you can program on both platforms but in general it is much easier on linux since a huge amount of open source software and libraries are prepackaged and easy to install and a lot of documentation you find is for use with linux.  Obviously you will not see a productive gain at first but you will have much less pain on linux when dealing with programming and handling edge cases.  #R is fine in Linux.  Also, if you do go with Linux, I recommend you Dual-Boot. It will be cheaper than a new machine, and faster than a VM.#If you can then do everything then it would be better.  If you attend an interview after and they ask about Linux you can then say you used it on your personal machine during college vs saying you installed and tinkered with it a few times#Will you be fine with Linux? Definitely yes, as long as you need to use either open computing stacks like R or Python (Pandas, Numpy/Scipy, Scikit-learn), and even with proprietary ones that are reasonably well supported on Linux like MATLAB. In my experience, I haven't had problems with any of these.  > VM or dual boot ?  I would highly recommend a dual boot if you want to learn about Linux and its software stack, and also make maximum use of it. Specially if you are planning to work locally as opposed to a server. It would also help to avoid hassles with display drivers (and you will need it for visualization) and what not that you might encounter in a VM. If you're unsure about how well it will play with your machine, you can simply try it in a live session. Another reason to consider this is if you end up using software for which you need licenses like MATLAB.   All this said, I would be wrong if I said a VM isn't likely to work. It's just that there's no reason why you shouldn't do an actual install. And of course, the usual disclaimer that I don't necessarily know what's best for you.  VM or not, I'd say stick to Ubuntu (or the other official flavors) since it offers the most painless experience I've seen in terms of hardware support, and package availability. Unless you insist on having the latest and greatest of everything, this is probably what you want. Good luck with your career!#Yes   Go 100÷ Linux  Your future will thank you#Depending on the machine, you can install an additional HD or at least an mSATA sized SSD and give Linux its own HD. This way you can do full disk encryption. I recommend Debian.#I would be surprised if there were a single best operating system. Linux works best for me because it's easy to install stuff, it manages my windows for me, and generally gets out of my way.#ee student here  if your administration supports it; for sure if it doesn't; good luck with all the required programs that don't run on linux#1 - developer stuff is better supported on linux (e.g. golang pushes new stuff out on linux)  2 - half of being a developer is everything 'around' the immediate language (you learn more of this 'context' using linux)  having said that learning linux should not be near the top of your priorities."
cfs;6g6ceo;1496984274.0;/r/cfs/comments/6g6ceo/potential_biomedical_cures_and_hope/;Potential biomedical cures and hope;TL DRThere is hope, and it's real----------------------Bed bound recovery stories like Mike Dessin, Julie Rehmeyer, Joey Tuan, and others on this fourm show us the damage is not permanent even if it affects the brain and CNS (and even if those patients later relapse).----------------------Hey everyone,I'm relatively new here so I make this thread with humility and respect for those suffering a long time. I've been feeling down lately and I've noticed a lot of other people feeling the same. So I wanted to put together all the potential biomedical treatments / cures that give me hope in the desire that others will benefit as well, and invite anyone else to add on with anything I've overlooked.I'll start with some broad trends, then focus on specific treatments, and close with a heartening real world example.Research. There is now more research than ever before. NIH funding has doubled. Prominent new researchers are coming into the field. And a very talented group of world class scientists and doctors are assembling at OMF in Palo Alto, California. Yes more funding is needed, but the momentum is very positive.Advocacy. Jen Brea, Congressional briefings, NIH, the demise of PACE are the headlines here as well as all the other advocacy groups building steam. This wasn't true several years ago.Broad scientific and medical advancement. There are new medical and scientific breakthroughs happening at an increasing rate. Broader trends abound as well: big data, precision medicine, gene therapy, stem cells, nano technology, metabolomics are just a few examples of ways humanity is galloping toward a brighter future with less suffering and more cures for complex and poorly understood diseases.One example: gene therapy can now cure leukemia and sickle cell.----------------------Now on to the tangible treatments and cures:A pathway for existing drugs.Ampligen may pick up steam in Argentina and Europe demonstrating to the new (more lenient) FDA it's effectiveness for the post-viral cohort. Remember that Ampligen has brought about bed bound recoveries for many, including members of this forum.Rituximab is looking likely to clear Phase 3 in Norway which means big money for Genentech and an option for the autoimmune cohort. Yes there is mixed anecdotal evidence for RTX in the US, but remember it has created long term remission for at least 5 Fluge / Mella patients with CCC diagnosis.There are other monoclonal antibodies that may also prove effective such as Bortezomib and Tocilizumab or immunosuppressants such as Cyclophosphamide and Rapamune. Additionally HSCT is becoming safer and more refined as an almost total cure for many autoimmune diseases.The African sleeping sickness drug Suramin showed promising results in a pilot autism trial and may soon end up treating ME/CFS metabolic pathology at its core.Ron Davis is using his impedance assay to test every FDA approved drug (the assay is also a potential biomarker). There are drugs like Suramin out there that have never been tried before. And given the success of Rituximab for some of the autoimmune cohort there is great reason to believe some of these drugs will be beneficial.A huge amount of research and focus is being done on microbiota. Refinements in fecal matter transplants and probiotics are occurring rapidly.New drugs on the horizonThere are new, better monoclonal antibodies being developed that can precisely target aberrant auto-antibodies while leaving the rest of the immune system in tact.On the antiviral side, drugs like DRACO are being developed to eradicate all viruses. Shorter term, a team in Rega, Belgium is working on a chronic enterovirus cure codenamed Compound 17 that is already eradicating Coxsackie B4 from the brains and organs of mice without major side effects.Dr Jarred Younger is working on a new version of LDN that can be taken at higher doses and bring down microglial inflammation (brain fog / fatigue) to an even greater degree.And a precision nutrient delivery system called Endotherapia for hard to treat long standing illnesses is being developed in France.----------------------This may all sound abstract. What would a cure (or excellent treatment) really look like and is such a concept possible? Yes and we don't have to go all the way back to Penicillin. Let's look at the amazing example of a drug called Sofosbuvir (aka Harvoni).For decades certain strains of Hepatitis C (a chronic virus in some ways similar to enteroviruses such as CVB and herpes family viruses such as EBV and CMV) had no cure or good treatment. People would often suffer devastating symptoms including organ failure, fatigue, weight-loss, jaundice, and cognitive impairment. Additionally hundreds of thousands would die each year. Treatments weren't great and had very bad side effects.Then sofosbuvir came along, with a total cure rate of 90%. This may still sound abstract, so let's look at actual patient reports:http://forums.phoenixrising.me/index.php?attachments/upload_2017-6-8_19-37-13-png.21773/http://forums.phoenixrising.me/index.php?attachments/upload_2017-6-8_19-39-24-png.21774/http://forums.phoenixrising.me/index.php?attachments/upload_2017-6-8_19-41-33-png.21776/These are real people freed after years (or in some cases decades) of suffering. Dr John Chia thinks the aforementioned Rega Compound 17 will be much like Sofosbuvir.;[deleted]#Nice summary.  I'm feeling truly hopeful for the first time in a long time! Mostly because of Davis's dogged determination.  Unfortunately, I think Ampligen is dead in the water and I don't know what will recover it.  If Dr. Davis or Drs Fluge & Mella can find drugs that you take less frequently, I don't know think patients will continue to get expensive Ampligen infusions twice a week indefinitely. In the US it is down to one doctor giving it, and when the company revised it's pricing, many of his patients needed to drop out.   Technically someone in Argentine can get Ampligen, but they have to be severe to qualify.  That must make the patient cohort very, very small.  #Just wanna say, there's always more male recovery stories..#ron already tried suramin,  he said it appeared to work,  on cellular level in that testing scenario at least #You sort of allude to it, but what about ART in relation to XMRV a la Mikovits?#<deleted>

I've never heard of the term ""Conscious AI"", and a quick google search will confirm there is no common usage of the phrase.  Moreover, it's obviously an extremely problematic phrase, as it's impossible to determine whether a given AI would be conscious.  For now, it's sufficient (and standard practice) to just distinguish between Narrow AI and AGI.  The [hard problem of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness) is a completely separate issue and shouldn't have its own ""category"" when distinguishing between the two basic types of AI.#Whats the difference between AGI and a True AI?  >For Artificial Intelligence to have complex, nuanced conversations that can pass for human, it needs to be able to solve new problems on the spot. It needs to interpret accents it has never heard before, vocabulary through context, and create sentences it has never had to express before.  To pass as a human an AGI should think like one (not talking about turning test alone). Dont you think an AGI needs to be conscious for this?  I personally think that an AGI would have the same intelligence of an average  human."

Well to start with, lying on your resume is generally frowned upon.#This is not a competitive resume for a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer. This is because Data Science is such a small part of your resume: You need a section that has all your data science projects and lists the key metrics. In my opinion, your professional experience and ""other interesting"" sections take up waaaay to much room. I would list your skills up top, Data science projects next, experience next, and then finally your education. This is how I built my resume, and I have a PhD. It was very hard for me to put my education on bottom, because its what I am most personally proud of. But skills and projects are what is going to land you an interview, If you were to apply to the job you currently have listed with that resume I'd seriously doubt you'd get an interview.  Those things need to be the focus of your resume, and right now experience is the focus of your resume, and it isn't strong enough to carry the day. If you previously held a data scientist position, then it would be strong enough.   I also don't think you are a strong candidate for machine learning engineer, unless you are seriously underselling your development / CS skills.  Most of the ML engineers I know are CS majors who have C++/CUDA experience and knowledge of data science. They are building fast production ready models. Nothing on your resume shows you have any experience doing that.   Perhaps you could land a Data Scientist position, but without knowing how advanced the techniques you used on particular projects I don't know what that might be. I think you'd be really strong as a Senior Analyst in a field you have no domain knowledge or a data scientist where you do have domain knowledge .   An example of what I mean by your projects, for example is you said you used ""NLP"" to do something. Does that mean you used build a spell checker using some sort of Eigen decomposition algorithm or did you use an RNN(LSTM ect).    Specificity is the sign of someone who knows what they are good at, this resume reads as someone who found a bunch of keywords and put it on their resume.   I hope this helps, sorry to be so critical. #I wouldn't list R, SPSS or SAS under ""Big Data""#Without knowing the specific jobs you are applying to the advice you will get will be shallow at best and dangerous at worst.

Parenting;6df9s7;1495779984.0;/r/Parenting/comments/6df9s7/lol_game_addiction/;LOL game addiction;[deleted];"As a gamer, let him do it. he's 18 and found something he's passionate about. I don't think the right approach is to ""get him out of this LOL game"" but make him take responsibility.  If he wants to play it as much as he does then he needs to contribute to the cost of your home, internet, and electricity. If he can't do that then you will have a problem.  What was his response to having to pay for the electric?  Also, LOL (League of Legends) has the largest online gaming community right now. It's the equivalent of the NFL as far as gaming popularity goes.#I'd look at it like going to the Superbowl, except he might get a chance to play with some of his favorite 'athletes'.   There's not really much else you can do other than having him move out just so the problem is out of sight and out of mind, but it's not going to stop him from playing. While you see him as being socially withdrawn, he is probably gaming with a community of friends. I looked it up, and the last World Championship of that game was seen by 43 million spectators.   But it sounds like he's got a job, and does things outside the house on occasion, and is already working on his future.   Eventually, he'll either get bored and grow out of it, get too busy to be able to afford the balance between work and competitive gaming and go more casual, or some other game will sweep in and be the next hot thing. His job performance may suffer, and that's something he'll have to learn about on his own, through his own failures and triumphs.   But if he's running up bills, charge him. That's not unreasonable at all, and the cost of his gaming is something he should be accounting for anyway. #Yeah, you can't actually tell another adult they're ""not allowed"" to play a game. But you can *absolutely* decide that in your own home, the Wi-Fi goes off at 11pm, and he should already be responsible for his own phone bill anyway. If he's going to be so energy intensive he's using all the solar credits for the entire household, he should be responsible for their value. Do the math on what your average usage was with him home vs not home and charge him the difference.   From there, if he wants to blow his data and play to 2-3am, that's his business. If it just annoys or concerns you so much you feel it's time he's fully responsible for himself, that's yours. And both valid and acceptable.   But at the very least he should be responsible for the actual costs of his playing the game to you... The upside to the moving out plan is that it means he'll have to work to afford his own connection, energy, rent, food etc... And that means simply not having as much time/energy available to play the game - which could be a good thing as I lost my first husband to mechwarrior/WoW... Game addiction is real.#How is it affecting his life other than annoying you?  Is his grades suffering?  Is his hygiene suffering?  Is he ignoring responsibilities?  If he is, you can make an argument that he should take care of important things first.  If it's not really affecting his life negatively, then he should be able to do what he wants in his free time.#As others said, he's old enough to contribute money for his phone and electricity usage. You mentioned he does tennis lessons or what not, but maybe he needs to get a new part-time job to pay his new bills.   Living at home is an ideal way to save money, but he's an adult so you should have an adult-agreement on what the stipulations are (maintaining a 3.0 GPA, 12+hrs per semester, list of chores).   If he want's to spend his money on silly stuff that's his business so I would ignore the trip. Now if he says ""I can't pay for my phone."" You can point out a $1000 can pay for quite a bit of phone usage.   As for video game addiction, it's a real thing and people are effected to various degrees. You haven't given the full story on your son outside of playing a lot of games so I don't think anyone can comment with good judgement on whether he's ""lost his way"" or not.   Online interactions are social interactions, but they are not a social life. I would suggest reading up a little on video game addiction, but this is just like anything else. Games should be taken in moderation. You can help your son by trying to get that point across. I would recommend the approach of being a concerned parent vs the internet shut-off shenanigans. He's too old to treat like a kid. That being said, if things don't improve you need to have your plan for addressing that (charging full rent, kicking him out, etc.).#As a gamer, I'm noticing some serious red flags here. He has lost a job recently. That doesn't sound good. He's reducing his socializing. That's a big problem. Games are not an outlet for socializing if they interfere with well established relationships. Your kid is falling down a rabbit hole here at precisely the age that serious mental illness tends to develop in young adults. You need to intervene. Right now you're subsidizing his entire life so you have a lot of control. Put time limits on gaming and discuss your concerns.   See if you can't get into hobbies as a family. Travel, bike, train to climb Kilimanjaro, shit do anything to get him engaged in the real world. Show him the kind of real experiences that money can buy. Don't just forbid the gaming, incentivize his exploration of the world. "

I know that spark is good for big data ( terabytes, petabytes) so I am wondering how it would perform on tens of gigabytes at a time using a basic standalone cluster, a single node ( 8 cores , 128 GB ram) or a master and a slave?I can perform ETL using mongo's aggregation framework and a programming language but I want to build a scalable solution. Also the aggregation framework is kind of limited when you want to run a complex query so you have to do part of the job programatically;You won't really see any benefit from Spark if you're not running on a cluster - may as well use Pandas at that point.#What are you trying to do with the data? You probably just need to do some data modeling and toss it on Redshift.#Get a 3 node EMR cluster of a reasonable node type and run some spark sql queries against your dataset, and you will be convinced it is fine. You may need 5 nodes, but ya.

I haven't had much guidance so I've taken jobs selling life insurance on commissio, digital marketing for SMBS ($1k deal size.)  After a year of unemployment, I signed on as the second SDR for a small company.  After 20 months I was blindsided out of the blue with a company downsizing.  I made a great move to a six figure closing role, but again I got downstized after being the number one rep after 6 months.I've been thinking about going to General Assembly to learn Big Data/python,javascript to make myself less disposable and to increase my technical knowledge in sales, possibly to move towards a sales engineer role.  My other options are to grind towards another sales job and face the risk of being fired.Are there an technical certifications that would help my career in IT?  I'm willing to sacrifice a year attending bootcamps/studying to network my way into a sales role, but unsure of what to do at this point.  Much advice would be appreciated.;"Theres a growing demand at most companies for sales analytics / strategy. You'd be the guy pulling and compiling data, building dashboards, making recommendations and driving sales strategy. The ideal candidate is an analyst who thinks like a sales person.   Excel, Salesforce, SQL and Tableau (in that order) and you can pick up a 90k base as a Sales Ops / Strategy Manager. #I am looking at giving away the training my company does. We do b2b sales. Thinking about a free course that is highly relevant to SMB tech sales. The benefits to us would be new hires would be easily able to get ramped up and ready to go & our management would be able to do more coaching and less training.   Benefit to those in industry/applying would be the ""certification"" or knowledge of how an experienced sales professional gets b2b smb clients? Maybe could help someone who doesnt know anything about the industry or market?   What do you think?

Even youre ECs are strong.   Yes, your GPA is a weak 3.1, but top schools will blink once, and your 760 more than makes up for it. This is a great profile on its own, and the fact that youre a minority female makes it even better.  Glad that you're familiar with Consortium--it's an amazing program, definitely take advantage of all it has to offer.  I'll be shocked if you don't get into multiple M7s with money. HBS should happen with strong execution and interview, and I'd consider throwing Stanford into the mix--you have a better shot than most. #I love your career goals. They are clear, crisp, and very reasonable given your background. You just need to connect your previous work experience to that story through business school and you will be golden.  As for the extra-curriculars, emphasize the leadership intensive ones and drop the marathoning. You have some really stunning achievements in your community involvements and you want to be able to tell a story about how you have led people in the past and will be able to quickly make a difference in the MBA community.  You will get into a top-15 school and likely an M7. The weakness in your app is your GPA and undergrad (do you have any classmates who go to HBS, Booth or Kellogg?), but I think the adcom would be willing to overlook that one weak point if you are able to tell a gripping story that is full of impact. That's the one thing I don't see too much of here.  Happy to help. Reach out with questions!#You will absolutely get into M7s, probably with money. Just make sure you write great essays!!#Do you mind sharing what your pre MBA compensation is and what your target comp post MBA is?

GradSchool;6g0zkf;1496929021.0;/r/GradSchool/comments/6g0zkf/question_on_low_ranked_phd_programs/;Question on low ranked PhD programs;Hi all,I'm not new here (due to dad having cancer, me panicking, but all being well now) but despite my lurking and posting, I have a question about life after this MA program I'm in. It's a terminal masters with no PhD, intended to get grads jobs in our city or DC. It does that really well because we focus on writing, presentation, and technical/programming skills necessary for industry positions such as analysts or research assistants. A few have moved on in other PhD programs in other fields. However a terminal applied MA is rare in economics, as in most are consolation prizes for PhD dropouts or cash cows to fund their PhDs. That's​ why I chose this program, there's no competing PhDs. I've been an RA and TA (non teaching) and my RA advisor wants to keep working with me for future journal articles once he gets back from his sabbatical. I'm doing a thesis rather than a capstone next year to continue this work, which could then contribute to a few papers with him. That'd give me three authored publications out of my MA and a few past students managed to publish their thesis/capstones. Of course, I'd be second author to my advisor on the non-thesis, most likely.So, I love research, that's great. However I have a few concerns that I was hoping someone could offer insight on.1. This program, being new and unorthodox, isn't a top ranked place despite having professors from high places, and a few lower. That was fine for industry locally. Is that fine for academia?2. I got a B in microeconomics in my first semester thanks partially to cancer entering our family and partially to a strict professor that gives the type of exam that everyone fails and the scale is arbitrary. My GPA with 2/3 credits completed is a 3.7 overall. Will this kill me?3. How much could second author publications help, if at all?4. My biggest reservation is my desire to stay in the Northeast. My family is here and the cancer really gave perspective on the importance of family. My husband also has a job here. I suppose I could apply to PhDs and jobs and decide later? If I'm not in an R1, I won't exactly have first choice of where I work and I can't see myself moving past Philadelphia.5. I'd like to have kids someday. Does it make more sense to get a PhD after they're in school? I'm already married and we've been saving for these things. My husband says to do what I want because we're only 23-24 but a PhD will put us way up there if we want multiple kids.6. Do econ PhDs really take the jobs of policy PhDs? I'm more interested in policy than econ but I'm not sure which is the best call. I'd need to take more math before I could get into an econ PhD. My main interests are agricultural.(Edit: As in, agricultural and environmental policy. I think incorporating economic optimization adds value but the field of economics tends to focus on big data in my experience to-date and with new/unorthodox technologies/ag methods, it's not always possible to run regressions.)I'll also add I don't mind if the main consequence of a low ranked is ending up at a teaching school. I'd love that!Thanks!!;Hello! Econ PhD at a low ranking school here. PM for any more questions 1. Having a masters helps when applying to PhDs but mostly the number and rigorousness of the math/stats courses you took matters more. (in my opinion)  2. A B won't kill you. Just explain it in your personal statement and get a letter of recommendation that maybe highlights your microecon skills.  3. Having RA experience and a letter of rec from your RA adviser is probably good enough. A publication is good, but it really depends on the tier of the journal. Publications take a while to go through so it wouldn't be worth waiting the year that it might take. Highlighting your RA work and contributions to the project would be sufficient.   4a.HAHAHAHA, even graduating from an R1 doesn't guarantee you have a choice on location or type of job. Though there are always think tank and consulting firms in the Northeast that will take economists regardless of school quality.   4b. I think the biggest problem may be that the Northeast has lots of great schools (r1) but not a lot of R2 schools. Your fallbacks if you don't get into an R1 are not great.  5. Getting a PhD before kids might make more sense since the returns are greater. After your second year, the pressure reduces and you can manage having kids. PhD positions also offer more flexibility than MA industry positions, which makes having kids easier.(only if slightly) 6. Look at Ag Econ PhD programs if you are interested in those. Unfortunately most are in the Midwest or West. From my knowledge  people from low ranking econ phd programs tend to get similar positions as those coming from high ranking policy schools  These are just my opinions.  Also you never mentioned why you want a PhD?    #This is the Levy Institute, isn't it? If it is, I have a question to OP: how heavy is the Minsky bent, really?  If you want to work in policy, get work experience in policy first. That will give you a better perspective on what you want to achieve and what will get you there. Policy PhDs do indeed work in policy (they certainly don't work in academia, lol), but it's harder to get a job. tbh I'm not entirely sure why you want a PhD. You seem to be a normal person who enjoys research and policy work, sure, but also wants to have kids and live close to family and not devote her entire life to Science^TM . If you want to work in policy and do RA-type stuff, you don't need a PhD. You're fine with the credentials you have. Go get work experience.#Rank plays a role in placement for Econ PhD's, but it's not the end of the world. Although it does sound like you're more suited for a policy-type PhD than an Econ one  If you want kids, well, Econ PhD programs are notorious for taking longer than 5 years to complete. 6 seems to be the median from my anecdotal experience, and even 7 isn't too unusual

Just to give you another option, you might want to compare your choices to a SuperMicro E300-8D ( https://www.supermicro.com/products/system/Mini-ITX/SYS-E300-8D.cfm ), or if you'd rather have the power supply integrated and it be rackable in 1u, the 5018D-FN8T is virtually identical ( https://www.supermicro.com/products/system/1U/5018/SYS-5018D-FN8T.cfm ). If you need more beef, the E200-8D comes with a hexacore and the 5018D-FN4T comes with an octacore.  The specs and prices after you add the DDR4 and an M.2 SSD are VERY similar.. Bonus, it comes with two 10 Gbe SFP+ ports and 6+1 Gigabit RJ-45's (The 7th is for dedicated IPMI). Also you will get SuperMicro's KVM-over-LAN and all the other nice things about having IPMI. if you want performance and low power, from what I know, the Xeon-D's are quite good at what they do. These are pretty much top of the line for a little, low-power, quiet-but-packs-a-punch, and they're really well-priced IMO. I'm not sure exactly about availability/pricing in Europe, but I have to imagine it's similar.  The only reason I can think of off-hand why I might rather have an i7-7th gen would be for streaming Netflix at 4k, which is only possible on the i7-7th gens and /nothing/ else. So if this is going to be an HTPC, keep that in mind.  Also, remember, if you're trying to save money on RAM, you could always get one stick to start with, and add more as you grow into it. At least from eBay and Newegg over here, the 4x(whatver) kits are often literally four times the price of single (whatever) kits, for DDR4 anyway.

The Automatic Statistician employs a kernel search algorithm to provide a first step in this direction for regression problems. However this does not scale due to its O(N^3) running time for the model selection. This is undesirable not only because the average size of data sets is growing fast, but also because there is potentially more information in bigger data, implying a greater need for more expressive models that can discover finer structure. We propose Scalable Kernel Composition (SKC), a scalable kernel search algorithm, to encompass big data within the boundaries of automated statistical modelling.;Yes ... the biggest problem facing the automation of statistical modeling is an 0(N^3) running time.   \*is sarcastic\*

The topic was ""The Big Future of AI and Cognitive Technology"". I had a lot of fun writing it and talking about this future I see. I would love your thoughts. Sorry it's long! 20 minutes, you know? The slides were pretty much just titles with big pictures. Things like Wall-e and empty offices, and Hal 9000 at the end, of course. :) My original speech is on my LinkedIn post, but LinkedIn is banned, so I copied and set it up here. Enjoy!***What is the future?**Take a second to imagine a world where you can tell a computer your new business idea and it will research the idea, start the business, operate the business, and optimize the business completely on its own, without any human interaction. When we have reached this point, the need for human critical and logical thinking will cease to exist.The scary part about this is that many of you will live to see the day that world becomes a reality.Now, that is a bold claim, but I make it because my company is one of many that is working to make it true. And today, I want to walk you through what we are doing so you can see the future like I do.**Why I’m even talking about this**My name is Nick Szabo, and I’m the COO of Swizzle Global. I’ve spoken around the world on the future of artificial intelligence and cognitive technology, mostly because of the work we do. At Swizzle, we use cognitive technology focused around natural language processing to analyze customer feedback, and we are currently using deep learning techniques to build an AI that will automate the whole process. We have helped companies around the world, from banks to game companies, from Korea to the US.Recently I gave a speech at the Guiyang China Big Data Conference about the future of AI and cognitive technology, and I wanted to share my talk with you here. So this is my speech, modified a bit to be more easily read. Enjoy!**Cognitive Technology vs Artificial Intelligence**Before we start, we need to understand the difference between Cognitive Technology and Artificial Intelligence. Though these terms are often used interchangeably, they are very different.On the path to true AI, the first step is to make people smarter using technology. We want to really optimize the way humans work, so we can make the best decisions possible, based on all of the variables.Now, you are most likely aware that this is what we have been doing for decades with computers and big data. But in the past, computers were only able to help us with things that are quantitative in nature. Things we can assign numbers to. We can run really well made math equations (algorithms) on huge data sets and find incredibly valuable information, but when it came to finding important insights in things that are difficult to quantify, we were stuck. We still needed people to read words, look at pictures, listen to audio, watch videos, and learn from mistakes. And that is a problem, because we now have more words, pictures, audio, and video than we can deal with. And mistakes have never been costlier.This is where a new wave of technology comes in. Cognitive Technology.Basically a bunch of really smart people figured out how to make programs that can read, watch, see, listen, and more importantly, learn. This type of technology opens up a whole new set of data, and let’s us make incredibly smart decisions based on an awesome number of variables. And with the learning aspect, we can even leverage our past decisions.Cognitive technology gives humans the ability to make decisions based on significantly more data than ever before, but the key thing is that the humans are still making decisions. This is the big difference between cognitive technology and AI.An interesting side effect of cognitive technology is that, in order to create programs that can understand unstructured data, or data that isn’t numbers, we had to give programs the ability to actually learn. But now think about this. The whole point of this technology is to help us, humans, make smarter decisions. Now that we have programs that can learn and understand all sorts of inputs, we can tell the program what the decisions we have made based on the data the system gave us. And the program itself can start to learn why we made that decision, and can start to recommend future decisions, based on that knowledge.Eventually, the program will be able to recommend the same decisions a human would, except it will be able to calculate more variables, be able to make those decisions faster, and be able to optimize to a superhuman degree. This is when we hit Artificial Intelligence. A machine that does not help us make decisions. It makes them for us. When we reach this level, we will see a whole new level of job automation.We’ve seen this kind of thing before. Over the last century, manual labor has been steadily going to computers and robots over humans. They are cheaper, faster, more reliable, and don’t need vacation. Any job that is repetitive in nature has been in danger of being automated.But those of us in “thinking” jobs have felt safe. Those of us who make decisions, well, computers can’t take that! Right? AI is changing that. Actual artificial intelligence is coming that will automate thinking and decision making jobs. And when that happens, we are not ready.This is a scary future that most people on this planet do not actually think will happen. My team and I, though, are actively working on bringing this reality to life, and we are not the only ones. Today, I am going to walk you through what we are doing, so you can see the future like I do, and see how quickly it is coming for you.**Use Machines to make People Smarter**As I said, the first step towards getting rid of all of our jobs, is to make us better at our jobs using technology.At Swizzle, we focus on cognitive technology built around text analytics and natural language processing  Teaching computers how to read. The problem I solve is actually pretty simple. Companies today get TOO much customer feedback. Between emails, reviews, comments, forums, telephone conversations, blogs, and so much more, companies are buried in what their customers are saying. Inside of this feedback is incredibly valuable information, but there is way too much to read, so they are stuck.For example, we just helped a large bank. Their mobile app is ranked as one of the top 3 apps in the world, so you can imagine they get an insane number of app store reviews every day. Inside those reviews are bug reports, potential new product suggestions, marketing insights, PR problems, and so much more, but you can only read a small fraction of them. Using traditional text analytics solutions, like keyword analysis and sentiment analysis, they are able to see that some words have negative sentiment, but what does that really mean? Of course, a human could read the reviews and tell you what you should know and what you should do, but this kind of technology doesn’t dive deep like that, and a human can only read so much.Our solution is to use cognitive technology. Specifically, we created a system, called SIMON, that can learn what we are looking for, read for us, and tell us what we should know. The way it works is we pull all of the bank’s app store reviews and plug them into our Swizzle SIMON system. The system then identifies which reviews are the most important using algorithms we have made, and gives these reviews to a human, our data strategist.The data strategist then teaches the system why those reviews are important and what they mean. SIMON can now run calculations to learn why those reviews mean that, and take that knowledge and apply it to the rest of the reviews. When it finds new problems it doesn’t understand, it can work with the human who teaches it more. In the end, Swizzle’s system identifies, categorizes, and summarizes all of the important information that is inside the app store reviews, and gives it to the data strategist.It is really like a human working with a computer as a team.Now with this system, the data strategist knows everything he needs to know inside the reviews, and he has trained Swizzle SIMON to understand the reviews. For the bank, our data strategist understood exactly what they could do to make their app even better. He knew found who the bank’s customers think the biggest competitors are, and why. He uncovered buried testimonials where clients ranted and raved about how amazing the bank was. He knew what users really wanted to use the app for, and how the bank could help them. He knew every piece of important information inside the whole history of the app’s reviews as if he read and remembered every word.With this information our data strategist was able to talk to the bank, help them improve their product, and put together a report that summarized just what they needed to know. Using Swizzle’s SIMON, it was as if he downloaded all the reviews into his brain. Pretty cool, huh?**Use people to make computers smarter**So now the bank has a report and understands everything they need to know about their past reviews, but they still need a way to keep up to date on what people are saying in reviews every day. Just doing a report every few months is a quick way to stay out of touch with your customer.Thankfully, a side effect of using our system as a tool to help the data strategist is that the data strategist taught Swizzle how to truly understand what that bank’s customers are saying in app store reviews. And remember, the amazing thing about cognitive technology is that it can learn. We showed Swizzle’s SIMON what is important, why it is important, and what that particular bank’s customers mean when they leave a review. Now all we have to do is connect to the app store’s API and feed reviews into our system as they come in. Swizzle’s SIMON is now constantly reading reviews, analyzing them, and organizing them into what is important or not.Then, every week, SIMON creates a report of what is important to know, how previously identified problems are doing, and new information. This report is sent to our data strategist, who makes a decision as to what the bank needs to know, and trains Swizzle’s system further.To the bank, it is as if the data strategist is constantly just reading and remembering every review. It really is amazing, and keep in mind, this is not theoretical. This is what is happening right now. Today. The next step is where things get fun.**Artificial Intelligence**The next step on the path of us all losing our jobs is to move from Cognitive Technology to Artificial Intelligence.See, this whole time, the data strategist is not only training Swizzle’s SIMON to understand how to read these app store reviews, he is also training it how to interpret those reviews into important insights. Because this technology can learn, we can feed our client facing insights and recommendations into our system. SIMON can take this, and learn how a human interprets the data, and it tries to make those insights automatic. Feeding insights to our data strategist.Of course, these aren’t perfect yet, but soon, we will hit a point where the data strategist will not need to give our system feedback. Swizzle will run automatically and provide actionable insights of the same quality our data strategist does now.What’s more, you have to remember that this system is constantly reading reviews. It will be able to see the results of its recommendations, and learn how effective they are. Swizzle’s SIMON will be able to constantly find better and better recommendations as it continues.We can even train this system to know what teams need what information. If it finds a bug, it can tell the development team what they need to know to fix it. If it sees a PR problem, it can tell the PR team how to get ahead of it. If it notices a UX problem, a security alert, a product improvement idea, or anything, it can notify the right team, and give advice to take action on.Think about what this means. When we achieve this, there will be no need for anyone to read any app store reviews at that bank. There will be no need for anyone to look at any graphs, or analysis of keywords or sentiment. There won’t be a need for someone to interpret the results into something actionable. To communicate the customer’s will into actions. There won’t even be a need for customer surveys. The bank will have a system that does all of this, figures out what needs to be done, and then notifies the correct person on what they need to do.And remember, this is the step we are working on right now. This is happening today, not some distant future.**Automate Everything**Now let’s go even further and see how many jobs one AI can take.Instead of looking at just app store reviews, remember our product at Swizzle is to analyze all customer feedback. Let’s take emails, marketing engagements, comments, forums, blogs, survey data, telephone transcripts and more. Let’s put every means of communication our bank’s customers have through the same system we put app store reviews through.Swizzle’s artificial intelligence now takes in every piece of customer feedback available. Analyzes it. Categorizes it. Understands it, and builds actionable informative data from it. Swizzle uses this information to provide detailed recommendations on how to optimize your offerings, your messaging, your communications, and more. It can be asked detailed questions about your customers. Who they are, what they like, what they hate, what they want. Will they like this product or this? How should we approach them? Who are my competitors, etc.It can learn to identify PR disasters, before they happen, and help you get ahead of them. It can learn to identify new competitors or threats, recommend new products, or help you perfect your current products. It can do everything a human could, if that human was able to ingest EVERYTHING your customer says about you. Except it can do it for real, it can do it faster, it can do it better, and it can do it cheaper.When Swizzle’s AI can take in all customer feedback, it will have the capacity to replace human decision making in marketing research, customer analytics, product development research, parts of customer service, and more. You will now have a singular, intelligent entity that will take over listening to your customers, and recommend what you should do.The next step is team Swizzle up with all the other AI’s.**Who else is building AI?**Because, remember, this path I took you down is the path of one company. It is what we are working on, and it started with us just trying to make app store reviews more useful.You know we are not the only one solving business problems with cognitive technology. Other companies around the world are working on technology to help businesses with business intelligence, marketing automation, product development, financials, and so, so much more. Every aspect of running a business is currently being taught to a computer somewhere in the world in hopes of making things easier and more efficient. And every one of those companies are pushing toward automation. And that is happening right now!**An intelligent company**They are all building AI’s that will perfectly optimize their section of business. And when they all succeed, how long will it take for someone (or something) to piece it all together? To take all of the different AI’s, make them communicate with one another, and make one, incredible company that does not need humans. It will be able to research new ideas, start new businesses, operate those businesses, and optimize them without any human.Every aspect of running a business is currently being taught to a computer somewhere in the world in hopes So you ask me, what is the future of AI and cognitive technology? It is beautiful, amazing, optimized to a whole new degree. And it has little place for humans.**My Advice**Does this scare you a bit? My advice? Find all the different companies out there that are automating various aspects of your business. Go out of your way to engage with them. Take some risks and try to find what parts of your business you can automate. Keep an open mind and try to trust technology more. If you get ahead of this, you'll lead the way. If you try to follow, you might never catch up...";" ""We still needed people to read words, look at pictures, listen to audio, watch videos, and learn from mistakes. And that is a problem, because we now have more words, pictures, audio, and video than we can deal with. And mistakes have never been costlier."" Great insight. Still reading.       ""The whole point of this technology is to help us, humans, make smarter decisions. Now that we have programs that can learn and understand all sorts of inputs, we can tell the program what the decisions we have made based on the data the system gave us. And the program itself can start to learn why we made that decision, and can start to recommend future decisions, based on that knowledge. ""      You make it sound like what is already happening with Amazon, Facebook, Google and other recommendation software. Which means it's happening right now, just getting better. #""Of course, these aren’t perfect yet, but soon, we will hit a point where the data strategist will not need to give our system feedback. Swizzle will run automatically and provide actionable insights of the same quality our data strategist does now.""      Ok Nick, this is where it seems to get critical for the efficacy of AI: When the game starts changing. For example, let's say everything is tuned and then a crisis occurs, for example an East Coast Hurricane, totally changing the picture of banking dynamics. Remember the crisis in Japanese nuclear plant? The learning AI has new data to deal with and we can envision humans needing to step in.       But here's the rub: by this time, the learning/decision process of the AI has moved beyond human ability and is largely opaque to human scrutiny. Outputs become unexpected. Remember the chatbot that developed a racist attitude? Remember the stock market flash crashes?       I'm not advocating a kill switch. That seems ludicrous. But surely you've thought about this scenario. What preparations are being made ?      "

I am currently using MS Excel to forecast my data. It is a pretty comfortable job and pays well. I have completed my Master's degree in Engineering a year back. So basically life is pretty steady right now. I want to get into the field of Big Data Analytics and Data Mining. I am well adept of using different forecasting techniques for data analysis. I am a beginner to average level coder in R. I want to implement some of the techniques in our current business model as well. But, I wanted to know, what would be the next logical step in transitioning from a person using Excel right now to a person adept at Data Analysis. Any certifications which would help me improve myself?Or has anyone gone through the same process and have any specific recommendations?Help is greatly appreciated! ;"SQL is definitely the best place to start. I wouldn't worry too much about different subsets of SQL/MySQL because if you know one, learning another, for the most part, is really easy. A great way to learn R and also machine learning is An Introduction to Statistical Learning (http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). Another book I would check out is The Data Warehouse Toolkit. It's a great introduction to schema modeling and uses many different examples.   Data visualization is the easiest thing to learn. Tableau and Power BI are extremely easy to learn. I currently work with Power BI and had no prior experience. Another great resource is Azure. They offer a one month free trial with a $200 credit. Keep in mind though, that you only have one month to use the credit, so when you start it, study hard. With my current project we do machine learning on Azure, and it's really simple to use. For statistical analysis I would just use R Studio. If you can do correlation analysis, linear regression testing, etc.. in there, you can easily do it in any proprietary software. We use SPSS and it was very easy to pick up.   Lastly, I would figure out a direction you want to go with big data. I'm not saying you have to restrict yourself, but once your foot is in the door it makes understanding what to learn much easier and helps you not get bogged down thinking you have to learn the million flavors of SQL. Right now I am doing BI consulting at Microsoft, but I also help out with analytics for a smart city project. If you have further questions don't hesitate to shoot me a message. I spent 11.5 years in the Navy, left and got my degree in math, and then into big data. So I definitely understand the position you are in. #Your post actually mentioned my usual advice to this question: ""I want to implement some of the techniques in our current business model as well""  The best way to learn a new language or approach to tackling data science is to take an existing process and replicate it in something like Python or R. If there is a report that you have to generate in Excel periodically, see if you can automate it with Python or VBA even.  Also, for what it's worth, I would throw Python into the mix as far as a language to get started with.  I don't think anyone else has mentioned it yet.    VBA is another good programming language to start with because it sits underneath of Excel, so if you create an Excel tool using VBA, your colleagues will be able to use it without having to install Python/R, etc.  #It would definitely be useful to have a background in SQL.  Most big data query languages use SQL or something derived from SQL: HiveQL, Spark SQL, Cassandra CQL, U-SQL etc. they all have their roots in SQL proper.    Plus, visualization is another requirement. Knowing PowerBI, Tableau or other presentation layers are helpful.    MapR has some free training courses on Spark.  The Hortonworks certifications are pretty accessible.  If you're interested in the Microsoft ecosystem, I think Microsoft just introduced a MCSA certification on machine learning."

Need information.;Hi fellow data nuts,On July 1, I will be moving from a BI developer (ETL, data warehousing) using the MS SQL platform to being a data engineer at a data science firm, using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to work with big data.My current role sees me making exclusive use of SQL Server and SSIS for my ETL and data modelling purposes. The new role requires knowledge of SQL (which I have, 4 years) and Python (which I have, ~2 years). The technologies I will be exposed to are:* The entire GCP suite, with specific focus on BigQuery, Compute Engine, and Kubernetes (spelling?).* I will also be exposed to and required to work with technologies like Apache Hadoop, Apache Airflow, etc.Yes, I am nervous about it, because I've never worked with data at this scale and all the data I've worked with has been structured, according to the requirements of 3NF, before modelling it and storing it in a Kimball inspired data warehouse.I ask the following:1. What are some of the pitfalls I need to be aware of?2. What are good resources for learning about big data?3. What will the biggest shock be in terms of the technical aspect of the move?;So Big Table excels when all your data is in one big denormalized table. Complete opposite of what you're used to.  If they are using Hadoop technologies it'll get weirder yet In that you are storing files,and putting the scheme on them later.#You can organize collaboration with other data scientists (make your data science projects reproducible and shareable) by sharing datasets thru GCP cloud storage (while keeping the code on Git) using this new tool for version control and iterative machine learning - http://dataversioncontrol.com

It was a smattering of PhDs, master's students and the occasional undergrad or Extension student (like me). Super smart, the lot of them.I wish HES would run more 2xx level courses parallel with FAS. Is there some way to talk the administration into emphasizing these types of classes? The NUMBER of courses offered thru HES has been growing like wildfire the last couple of years after staying around 500 for over a decade - I really wish there were a way to influence the direction of the curriculum's development, especially in CS.Ideas?;Your professors should know. They'd be instrumental to the process at some point, so it'd only benefit you to involve them from the outset. #I'm not sure how HES is governed since they're technically part of FAS, but at other harvard schools things related to curriculum usually initiated and discussed at faculty meetings. So faculty might still be the right starting point, maybe there is an Extension or department equivalent to look into, or someone in that arena at least to help you get started?

Now, you can potentially gather GPS coordinates, velocity, and other pertinent data from millions of users.  You can couple that with other relevant data.  Pollen count, traffic, temperature, media coverage, retail sales, etc. at once per millisecond.  That takes a lot of data - more than could fit on a standard off the shelf server.  That requires a ton of horizontal servers that can handle ""big data.""  Big data is in general a lot of smaller machines grouped together to handle tons and tons of data.  This data is often times not structured well, so instead of parsing it once in a long arduous process and storing it on a big, big machine, it keeps the data in sometimes a more loose format, and searches and groupings are done at the individual computer level.  Since there are many computers, you can just add and add and pretty much get near infinity (okay, that's an exaggeration) of space.  With nearly unlimited data, and computing, sorting, grouping done in a distributed fashion through many, many off the shelf, cheap computers, data can be analyized and patterns can be found way beyond the normal, pre big data sets of data we had before."

statistics;6f4arm;1496533148.0;/r/statistics/comments/6f4arm/graduate_stats_and_medical_technology/;Graduate stats and medical technology;I've recently posted on this subreddit, but have another career-related question. I've been interested in pursuing an MD/PhD in biostatistics, and delving deeper into clinical trials. However, a big goal of mine is to use my analytical knowledge and understanding of medicine to create a health technology business or clinical trials organization of my own. As an undergraduate and a first-generation URM student, it's been hard finding direction with my goals, as the advisors at my school don't know much and are hard to reach. I have competitive grades and I've been enjoying the research I've been doing (epidemiology and longitudinal data analysis), but have no real understanding of the academic pathway. My question is whether or not this is a logical plan and what schools/what kind of research I should understand to gain the most. There's a lot of research being done in sensor technology, and I think it'd be cool to see how that interrelates with big data analytics, but that often seems to fall under bioengineering. Is it possible to be interdisciplinary in a field like this? Any advice will be greatly appreciated!;"I really don't think anyone can answer your question, since overall you should pursue what you are interested in. if you are interested in sensor technology then look for mentors in that area..   Biostatistics and Epidemiology are very interdisciplinary.#Biostat has the potential to be this --- a lot of it is what you make of it (and which institution you end up at). For example, the University of Washington, and Johns Hopkins biostat departments have several world-class faculty working on design and implementation of clinical trials (Tom Fleming, Scott Emerson @ UW, Michael Rosenblum @ hopkins for example); and working on big data analytics (Daniela Witten, Ali Shojaie @ UW, Jeff Leek, Brian Caffo @ Hopkins). I don't know if they are doing work on sensors, but I think there have been a number of spinoff CROs (that contract to run the organizational and statistical aspects of clinical trials). There are other places doing this too: (maybe under the bio(medical)informatics title --- I might look into biomedical data science at Stanford).  An MD/PhD is a sort of complicated animal and takes many many years (though I know a person or 2 who took this route). Alternatively, you could do a PhD and concentrate on medical applications; or an MD and get an MS on the side though.#If you want to go the MD/PhD route I would not recommend biostats. Instead go with Epi.   The training and time it takes to develop methods in bio stats doesn't line up well with the MD PhD timeline - nor will it be easy when your a clinician. If you're an applied epidemiologist then you can still do the trial stuff you're interested in but your promotion track will align more with papers you can actually write while seeing patients. Of course, if you're committed then I'm sure you can make anything work"

The topic was ""The Big Future of AI and Cognitive Technology"". I had a lot of fun writing it and talking about this future I see. I would love your thoughts. Sorry it's long! 20 minutes, you know? The slides were pretty much just titles with big pictures. Things like Wall-e and empty offices, and Hal 9000 at the end, of course. :) My original speech is on my LinkedIn post, but LinkedIn is banned, so I copied and set it up here. Also, I posted this on r/futurology as well. Enjoy!***What is the future?**Take a second to imagine a world where you can tell a computer your new business idea and it will research the idea, start the business, operate the business, and optimize the business completely on its own, without any human interaction. When we have reached this point, the need for human critical and logical thinking will cease to exist.The scary part about this is that many of you will live to see the day that world becomes a reality.Now, that is a bold claim, but I make it because my company is one of many that is working to make it true. And today, I want to walk you through what we are doing so you can see the future like I do.**Why I’m even talking about this**My name is Nick Szabo, and I’m the COO of Swizzle Global. I’ve spoken around the world on the future of artificial intelligence and cognitive technology, mostly because of the work we do. At Swizzle, we use cognitive technology focused around natural language processing to analyze customer feedback, and we are currently using deep learning techniques to build an AI that will automate the whole process. We have helped companies around the world, from banks to game companies, from Korea to the US.Recently I gave a speech at the Guiyang China Big Data Conference about the future of AI and cognitive technology, and I wanted to share my talk with you here. So this is my speech, modified a bit to be more easily read. Enjoy!**Cognitive Technology vs Artificial Intelligence**Before we start, we need to understand the difference between Cognitive Technology and Artificial Intelligence. Though these terms are often used interchangeably, they are very different.On the path to true AI, the first step is to make people smarter using technology. We want to really optimize the way humans work, so we can make the best decisions possible, based on all of the variables.Now, you are most likely aware that this is what we have been doing for decades with computers and big data. But in the past, computers were only able to help us with things that are quantitative in nature. Things we can assign numbers to. We can run really well made math equations (algorithms) on huge data sets and find incredibly valuable information, but when it came to finding important insights in things that are difficult to quantify, we were stuck. We still needed people to read words, look at pictures, listen to audio, watch videos, and learn from mistakes. And that is a problem, because we now have more words, pictures, audio, and video than we can deal with. And mistakes have never been costlier.This is where a new wave of technology comes in. Cognitive Technology.Basically a bunch of really smart people figured out how to make programs that can read, watch, see, listen, and more importantly, learn. This type of technology opens up a whole new set of data, and let’s us make incredibly smart decisions based on an awesome number of variables. And with the learning aspect, we can even leverage our past decisions.Cognitive technology gives humans the ability to make decisions based on significantly more data than ever before, but the key thing is that the humans are still making decisions. This is the big difference between cognitive technology and AI.An interesting side effect of cognitive technology is that, in order to create programs that can understand unstructured data, or data that isn’t numbers, we had to give programs the ability to actually learn. But now think about this. The whole point of this technology is to help us, humans, make smarter decisions. Now that we have programs that can learn and understand all sorts of inputs, we can tell the program what the decisions we have made based on the data the system gave us. And the program itself can start to learn why we made that decision, and can start to recommend future decisions, based on that knowledge.Eventually, the program will be able to recommend the same decisions a human would, except it will be able to calculate more variables, be able to make those decisions faster, and be able to optimize to a superhuman degree. This is when we hit Artificial Intelligence. A machine that does not help us make decisions. It makes them for us. When we reach this level, we will see a whole new level of job automation.We’ve seen this kind of thing before. Over the last century, manual labor has been steadily going to computers and robots over humans. They are cheaper, faster, more reliable, and don’t need vacation. Any job that is repetitive in nature has been in danger of being automated.But those of us in “thinking” jobs have felt safe. Those of us who make decisions, well, computers can’t take that! Right? AI is changing that. Actual artificial intelligence is coming that will automate thinking and decision making jobs. And when that happens, we are not ready.This is a scary future that most people on this planet do not actually think will happen. My team and I, though, are actively working on bringing this reality to life, and we are not the only ones. Today, I am going to walk you through what we are doing, so you can see the future like I do, and see how quickly it is coming for you.**Use Machines to make People Smarter**As I said, the first step towards getting rid of all of our jobs, is to make us better at our jobs using technology.At Swizzle, we focus on cognitive technology built around text analytics and natural language processing  Teaching computers how to read. The problem I solve is actually pretty simple. Companies today get TOO much customer feedback. Between emails, reviews, comments, forums, telephone conversations, blogs, and so much more, companies are buried in what their customers are saying. Inside of this feedback is incredibly valuable information, but there is way too much to read, so they are stuck.For example, we just helped a large bank. Their mobile app is ranked as one of the top 3 apps in the world, so you can imagine they get an insane number of app store reviews every day. Inside those reviews are bug reports, potential new product suggestions, marketing insights, PR problems, and so much more, but you can only read a small fraction of them. Using traditional text analytics solutions, like keyword analysis and sentiment analysis, they are able to see that some words have negative sentiment, but what does that really mean? Of course, a human could read the reviews and tell you what you should know and what you should do, but this kind of technology doesn’t dive deep like that, and a human can only read so much.Our solution is to use cognitive technology. Specifically, we created a system, called SIMON, that can learn what we are looking for, read for us, and tell us what we should know. The way it works is we pull all of the bank’s app store reviews and plug them into our Swizzle SIMON system. The system then identifies which reviews are the most important using algorithms we have made, and gives these reviews to a human, our data strategist.The data strategist then teaches the system why those reviews are important and what they mean. SIMON can now run calculations to learn why those reviews mean that, and take that knowledge and apply it to the rest of the reviews. When it finds new problems it doesn’t understand, it can work with the human who teaches it more. In the end, Swizzle’s system identifies, categorizes, and summarizes all of the important information that is inside the app store reviews, and gives it to the data strategist.It is really like a human working with a computer as a team.Now with this system, the data strategist knows everything he needs to know inside the reviews, and he has trained Swizzle SIMON to understand the reviews. For the bank, our data strategist understood exactly what they could do to make their app even better. He knew found who the bank’s customers think the biggest competitors are, and why. He uncovered buried testimonials where clients ranted and raved about how amazing the bank was. He knew what users really wanted to use the app for, and how the bank could help them. He knew every piece of important information inside the whole history of the app’s reviews as if he read and remembered every word.With this information our data strategist was able to talk to the bank, help them improve their product, and put together a report that summarized just what they needed to know. Using Swizzle’s SIMON, it was as if he downloaded all the reviews into his brain. Pretty cool, huh?**Use people to make computers smarter**So now the bank has a report and understands everything they need to know about their past reviews, but they still need a way to keep up to date on what people are saying in reviews every day. Just doing a report every few months is a quick way to stay out of touch with your customer.Thankfully, a side effect of using our system as a tool to help the data strategist is that the data strategist taught Swizzle how to truly understand what that bank’s customers are saying in app store reviews. And remember, the amazing thing about cognitive technology is that it can learn. We showed Swizzle’s SIMON what is important, why it is important, and what that particular bank’s customers mean when they leave a review. Now all we have to do is connect to the app store’s API and feed reviews into our system as they come in. Swizzle’s SIMON is now constantly reading reviews, analyzing them, and organizing them into what is important or not.Then, every week, SIMON creates a report of what is important to know, how previously identified problems are doing, and new information. This report is sent to our data strategist, who makes a decision as to what the bank needs to know, and trains Swizzle’s system further.To the bank, it is as if the data strategist is constantly just reading and remembering every review. It really is amazing, and keep in mind, this is not theoretical. This is what is happening right now. Today. The next step is where things get fun.**Artificial Intelligence**The next step on the path of us all losing our jobs is to move from Cognitive Technology to Artificial Intelligence.See, this whole time, the data strategist is not only training Swizzle’s SIMON to understand how to read these app store reviews, he is also training it how to interpret those reviews into important insights. Because this technology can learn, we can feed our client facing insights and recommendations into our system. SIMON can take this, and learn how a human interprets the data, and it tries to make those insights automatic. Feeding insights to our data strategist.Of course, these aren’t perfect yet, but soon, we will hit a point where the data strategist will not need to give our system feedback. Swizzle will run automatically and provide actionable insights of the same quality our data strategist does now.What’s more, you have to remember that this system is constantly reading reviews. It will be able to see the results of its recommendations, and learn how effective they are. Swizzle’s SIMON will be able to constantly find better and better recommendations as it continues.We can even train this system to know what teams need what information. If it finds a bug, it can tell the development team what they need to know to fix it. If it sees a PR problem, it can tell the PR team how to get ahead of it. If it notices a UX problem, a security alert, a product improvement idea, or anything, it can notify the right team, and give advice to take action on.Think about what this means. When we achieve this, there will be no need for anyone to read any app store reviews at that bank. There will be no need for anyone to look at any graphs, or analysis of keywords or sentiment. There won’t be a need for someone to interpret the results into something actionable. To communicate the customer’s will into actions. There won’t even be a need for customer surveys. The bank will have a system that does all of this, figures out what needs to be done, and then notifies the correct person on what they need to do.And remember, this is the step we are working on right now. This is happening today, not some distant future.**Automate Everything**Now let’s go even further and see how many jobs one AI can take.Instead of looking at just app store reviews, remember our product at Swizzle is to analyze all customer feedback. Let’s take emails, marketing engagements, comments, forums, blogs, survey data, telephone transcripts and more. Let’s put every means of communication our bank’s customers have through the same system we put app store reviews through.Swizzle’s artificial intelligence now takes in every piece of customer feedback available. Analyzes it. Categorizes it. Understands it, and builds actionable informative data from it. Swizzle uses this information to provide detailed recommendations on how to optimize your offerings, your messaging, your communications, and more. It can be asked detailed questions about your customers. Who they are, what they like, what they hate, what they want. Will they like this product or this? How should we approach them? Who are my competitors, etc.It can learn to identify PR disasters, before they happen, and help you get ahead of them. It can learn to identify new competitors or threats, recommend new products, or help you perfect your current products. It can do everything a human could, if that human was able to ingest EVERYTHING your customer says about you. Except it can do it for real, it can do it faster, it can do it better, and it can do it cheaper.When Swizzle’s AI can take in all customer feedback, it will have the capacity to replace human decision making in marketing research, customer analytics, product development research, parts of customer service, and more. You will now have a singular, intelligent entity that will take over listening to your customers, and recommend what you should do.The next step is team Swizzle up with all the other AI’s.**Who else is building AI?**Because, remember, this path I took you down is the path of one company. It is what we are working on, and it started with us just trying to make app store reviews more useful.You know we are not the only one solving business problems with cognitive technology. Other companies around the world are working on technology to help businesses with business intelligence, marketing automation, product development, financials, and so, so much more. Every aspect of running a business is currently being taught to a computer somewhere in the world in hopes of making things easier and more efficient. And every one of those companies are pushing toward automation. And that is happening right now!**An intelligent company**They are all building AI’s that will perfectly optimize their section of business. And when they all succeed, how long will it take for someone (or something) to piece it all together? To take all of the different AI’s, make them communicate with one another, and make one, incredible company that does not need humans. It will be able to research new ideas, start new businesses, operate those businesses, and optimize them without any human.Every aspect of running a business is currently being taught to a computer somewhere in the world in hopes So you ask me, what is the future of AI and cognitive technology? It is beautiful, amazing, optimized to a whole new degree. And it has little place for humans.**My Advice**Does this scare you a bit? My advice? Find all the different companies out there that are automating various aspects of your business. Go out of your way to engage with them. Take some risks and try to find what parts of your business you can automate. Keep an open mind and try to trust technology more. If you get ahead of this, you'll lead the way. If you try to follow, you might never catch up...";How would it be able to research new ideas? It can't physically do something, it would still rely on humans

So I took a few months off and worked hard at learning development skills in the hopes of making a career move.So far, things have not worked out very well and I am reconsidering my approach. I realize that my disenchantment was more likely related to the job environment itself so I think a little time off has helped. With that being said, I am wondering if anyone here has made a move from networking to other related fields, like development, or big data, or DevOps, or some other technical field. Also, have you been able to leverage your networking skills to break into one of those fields? I am just getting tired of messing with switches and firewalls and doing lots of support, and I yearn to do something a little more creative. ;"[deleted]#Being able to think like a packet will serve you well in any IT role; networking is black fucking magic to way too many so-called experts in other towers. With that said, if you want to break into some other discipline, you're going to need to demonstrate skills in that field.#I was a big networking guy a few years ago that had to wear many hats during that time (more to virualization).  With that virtualization knowledge I have moved more over to AWS/cloud and dont do much on the router/switch/FW configuration anymore (though the networking knowledge always comes into play)  Devops is huge in cloud and cloud is only going to get bigger #I would suggest that you move into some other field.

I was outsourced out of my previous job - NAS data storage - and was having no luck finding a job in that field. I heard about Big Data and was intrigued but I'm starting to wonder if it's doable without a university degree.I took a Big Data Developer course from Simplilearn and I think I kind of got burned. They did an ok job of teaching the basics and the overall concepts but I still don't know what I feel I need to know about processing and sorting data, whether through Hadoop or Spark. My only programming background is being halfway through a book on Python and I feel like if I'm going to get anywhere with Spark/Hadoop I would need something that's very ""this command does this"", hands-on kind of training.There's a local company called ""We Cloud Data"" that offers courses:http://weclouddata.com/courses/They have an info session on Saturday that I intend to check out, but I question whether a proficiency in Big Data can be taught in 12 courses.I'm more than willing to do basic entry level work in the field while I gather more training.

Any thoughts?";If you have a solid amount saved in the bank (you can also get student loans for this) you can put down on a coding bootcamp 12 week intensive program for data science...it will help show you the doors.   Otherwise start making analytics apps in python (very much the language of data science), and slowly start applying to entry level jobs in your city. You will break through.

What is the best path for me in terms of building a career . Data engineer or Data scientist(possible to become one without a degree?);Data Science will require you to have an in-depth knowledge of statistical algorithms that can help make decisions about data.  You will have some pretty high expectations put on you to know how to provide actionable insights on data and prove that your work is worthy of basing company decisions on.  Re: degree, I see mostly masters/PhD in this role unless its a small company.  Data Engineering will be more about systems, infrastructure, and data discovery.  You will be building and using systems that massage data for Data Scientists and your business to use in making decisions.  So basically, do you want to be a scientist or an engineer?

investing;6dxf0o;1496020854.0;/r/investing/comments/6dxf0o/big_data_as_the_next_battleground_for_investing/;Big data as the next battleground for investing;"The following is an article from BI. Anyone else knowledgeable on the subject? (See original article for some coinciding charts: From here: http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-the-future-of-investing-and-you-probably-cant-afford-it-2017-5)Big money investors have always sought an edge. Everything from star traders to fast computers to unique analysis can give a big hedge fund an advantage over competitors. The latest battleground is data.Investors are vying for new data sets that their competitors don't have, or haven't thought of using. These can range from the basic credit-card sales information to satellite data that tracks shipping routes, and parsing this kind of data for trading signals has been called ""the future of investing.""The industry providing this to the funds has sprung up amid an explosion in obtainable data over the past decade. The bad news for the regular investor: the cost of data, and the complexity associated with turning it into investment insights, means it will probably only be available to the biggest and most sophisticated funds. At JPMorgan's macro quantitative and derivatives conference on May 19, the bank surveyed 237 investors, and asked them about Big Data and Machine Learning. It found that 70% thought that the importance of these tools will gradually grow for all investors. A further 23% said they expected a revolution, with rapid changes to the investment landscape. ""There was widespread agreement that Big Data and Machine Learning is transforming the investment landscape across different trading frequencies, with more than 80% of participants expecting a reduction in relevance of traditional data sources,"" JPMorgan said in a note. To be specific, 52% of investors felt big data was already rendering traditional data sources (like financial statements and economic releases) ineffective. In other words, the quarterly reports that many regular investors rely on are already becoming less relevant. The rise of so-called alternative data has created a cottage industry of firms that source, process and consult on various data sources. The market for this data is expected to double in the next five years in the US, from $200 million today to $400 million, according to a recent TABB Group report.More than half (51%) of investors surveyed said they expected to buy semi-processed data, while 29% said they wanted to fully process in-house by consuming raw data. Respondents to the survey were particularly interested in credit card and transactional data. Investors are able to use anonymous data gleaned from credit card statements, and the rise of online shopping, and the digital receipts we get in our email, is a also boon. That's because emailed receipts are usually itemized, giving investors greater detail into what people are buying.The biggest impediment? Cost. While a lack of expertise and management buy-in were cited by respondents as challenges, the most frequently cited impediment was high-fixed costs.That finding is striking, given JPMorgan's event attracted big money investors like BlackRock and AQR, with sizeable budgets to spend on the data, expertise and processing power.If they find it expensive, the regular investor has no chance. ";Regular investors don't have to compete for big data. It's fairly asinine to conflate institutional investors with private investors. We don't have to worry about the market cap of companies, or the way in which our investments will impact their share price. We also don't have clients to please or regulations to conform to. In short, we actually have a number of advantages, despite the big-data and quant analysis institutions have.

Over the past few years I've been reading about all of the really cool research that's being done with applied statistics and bio stats, and I've made it a personal goal to pursue an MD/PhD to interrelate medicine and research. I've been subscribed to this page for a while, and from reading some of these posts and trying to understand other aspects of statistics, I'm coming to realize that I don't know much at all. I'm really passionate and excited about the study, and I find myself reading ""trendy"" articles in data science, predictive analysis, and big data all the time, but it's not really helping me understand the meat and bones of statistics. I have a relatively weak math background, which I've been attempting to strengthen. Next semester I plan on taking linear algebra and an introductory computer science class. But I haven't taken a single theoretical class yet, and the only experience with statistics I have is the research I do in my lab, coding with R and STATA, and a couple of applied statistics classes where we learned about different tests. I guess my question is whether or not it's possible to learn some of this stuff on my own. If so, where do I start? Thanks!";It's certainly possible, indeed I have seen someone do it to a larger extent than I would have expected (though it took some pretty solid dedication). One thing that person did was *answer* a lot of questions on stats.stackexchange.com (also asked a few, but it was in the answering that you could really see the improvement).  I suggest finding some problems you can't quite do ... and set out to understand and solve them. Preferably practical ones whose solutions you care about.  #Yes, look on Coursera, edx, or ocw for an introductory course.#I did it myself (long ago).  Never had a statistics class until graduate school in statistics.  But if your math is weak, in particular if your calculus is weak, you won't understand theoretical statistics.  If you cannot read a theoretical statistics book or the level of De Groot and Schervish or Casella and Berger or something of the sort, you will always have big gaps in your understanding.  OTOH you don't' have to know all that much calculus to understand these books.  So you could give it a try.  When you get stuck, then you might switch to teaching yourself enough calculus to get past the sticking point in the statistics book.#Of course you can, it just won't be as good as someone who had years of training in a related discipline that comes from a higher degree. But lucky for you that is an option you still have, just put the PhD focus of your MD/PhD program in biostats. It's only after you *leave* school that it becomes not possible.

So we are going to go through this huge rebranding that will be revealed next week in Vegas to the public. Long story short- We used to be a private company called cheetahmail before we were bought out by a huge company called Experian. I am sure some of you have heard of this company before.  We were purchased officially (publicly announced) by a private equity company called vector capital who invests in a ton of tech companies worth billions. They have bought us at 600 million valuation which is hugely undervalued according to ""our management team"".   Our biggest competitor is Salesforce's Exact target whose cofounder interestly enough became our chairman after this purchase.  I was thinking about using this in the pitch because well that is our number 1 competitor. The other 3 big competitors is Oracle's responsys and IBM's Silverpop, and sometimes we run into Epsilon and Zeta depending on which region of the country we are competing in.  But anyways the reason why I am bringing this up is because was thinking about doing a campaign against Exact target which really is also one of the biggest opportunities because I will mention that their cofounder is our chairman now and of our biggest value props is that we are consistently ranked the highest by Gartner, Forrester and analysts to be the best service and support in the industry. And quite Frankly… their service sucks. They actually outsource their service. Which is huge in today’s age where everyone is fed up with outsourced service providers especially when you are paying millions in ACV.  Some of the other big differentiators are extreme segmentation and data driven approach plus ease of use meaning you do not need to be technical to use our drag and drop feature compared to our competitors who most likely you would need to know sql and other technical knowledge. The have to leverage their big data people to be able to use our competitors tools and ours you don’t. (Great selling point that I happen to forget to leave out in the moment sometimes). Maybe I just don’t know when to bring this up especially during the first call? Some of the challenges that I come across is when they say they are happy with what they are currently using. For instance, I have noticed when companies have Epsilon or Responsys(Oracle marketing cloud). It is harder for me to dig deeper.  Either than Data.com do you guys know of any free ways to get direct dials.  A strategy that has been serving me well lately is just really becoming good friends with the executive assistants to help me get my message across. I have been able to secure a lot of meetings trying to befriend them instead of trying to wiggle my way past the gatekeeper.  What are your thoughts on this? I kind of just answered my own question just reflecting and writing this post. That I needed to challenge them more and actually dig deeper and not be satisfied with just “I am happy where I am with my vendor relationship so far.” When you get that answer, what do you guys push without seemingly pushy?  I have noticed one of my strengths being able to write quality notes and “sometimes” ask the hard questions that give me the answers I need being who the right decision maker is, what is their timeline? Being that the average sales cycle for us is 6 months to a year. The average contract is anyway over a 1million dollars to 5 million on the deals I am helping out with. Average contract is 3 years long. Some others questions I have are.  What other creative approaches would you recommend for breaking into companies like P&G, General Mills, and Kimberly Clark. I have a lot of success with straight up like grinding and being super persistent but I have found that it tough to hit KPIs aka huge call volume expectations if I want to be personal and use relevant case studies per level (C levels, VPs, Directors, Manager, specialist, etc) I know these are a lot of hard questions but would appreciate any support around this.   Some of the ideas I have had are write out handwritten notes to decision makers and/or champions that have helped me in anyway. Just to stay top of mind.  Has anyone tried sending video emails? How has that worked for you?";I would recommend focusing slightly more on benefits over features.   They won't care about who your chairman is, what publication ranks you higher, or what tech you use, they only care about how you can improve their lives.   Can you save them money, time, get better results? If so, use proof points and current customers that are their competitors and hammer those points home! #Do you have insight at the contact level if they are using these technologies?  Epsilon Responsys Zeta Exact Target ?  Or are you just guessing?   I work for a company that can help.

Applying for Fall 2018 start.Thanks!**Work Experience**Currently - 1 year at a large bank (think PNC, Capital One, Bank of America) as a senior engineer working on big data and machine learning projects. My responsibilities include that which you'd probably associate with an engineering manager (recruiting, technical direction, project management). Based on reviews, expecting to be promoted to manager within the next 3 months.Previously - 2 years as a software engineer a mid-size S&P 500 tech company. Started as a graduate intern and offered full time position shortly after starting. Primarily focused on big data engineering.Before that - 2 years at a small regional (frankly, no-name) web development shop.**Education**B.S., Computer Science (3.2 GPA) from a state school in the #40-60 range for the major.M.S., Computer Science (3.6 GPA) from a state school, again in the #40-60 range.**Extra Curriculars**Member of cybersecurity clubs in undergrad and grad.**Age/Gender/Race**30 year-old male asian**GMAT**740 (41V/50Q/6AWA/7IR)**Goal of MBA**Looking to make the move into product management or accelerated leadership at a large tech company. I think the combination of technical expertise and a formal business education will give me the necessary skills to bring products to market on-budget and on schedule. **Target Schools**Wharton, Booth, Sloan, Haas, ColumbiaThanks for your feedback!;Good GMAT, not so good GPA, on the older side age-wise and solid (although not MBA relevant) work experience. You are a strong candidate, but some of your targets should be considered reaches. I would throw some apps to a few safer options with strong tech placement as well (Anderson, Fuqua, NYU).#UG gpa and prestige will be an issue, but you seem to have decent work experience that can tie to good essays. You might get 1 out of all the schools u mentioned.#Just a heads up, I'm at a top ranked tech company for an internship this summer in Product Management and I'm 35 at a T30 B-School where I have a full scholarship.  Top 10 is not necessary at all, just be careful about which schools you apply to. There's some awesome schools in the T30 that have great tech connections.  I'm not dissuading you from applying to T10 by the way, just that they aren't the only way to get where you want to go. 
datascience;6d5q6m;1495666810.0;/r/datascience/comments/6d5q6m/is_using_the_term_big_data_among_data_science/;"Is using the term ""big data"" among data science colleagues trite and cliche nowadays? (and other pet peeves)";"I'm not saying that I'm not grateful for all the predecessors in the past who paved the way but the buzzword usage of ""big data"" in mixed-background corporate boardrooms is so hackneyed and overused nowadays that it's a deprivation of any intent to properly define what they are actually talking about....they treat it like a black box and somehow the genie works....aka statistics and algorithmsAll the salespeople and business negotiators who know how to use rudimentary Excel pivot tables and SQL think that their 'loose definition' of big data allows them to smear this buzzword in every crevice of their conversation, proposal titles, and presentations just to sound smart in front of the uninformed. Big data is a misnomer tacked on to everything for it to seem more je ne sais quoi than what it actually is.I mean, it's cool because they are educating themselves on the new trends but after a while, it gets so old and unimaginative...if it's a data frame with 1 million rows just be humble and call it a data frame already...if it's anything less and you can open the file on excel without it lagging for 2 minutes, the data is not big enough to qualify -- that's the rule of thumb.If you are practicing the discipline among peers, you don't dare utter that term unless you want to be the laughing stock...the term 'data science' in the future will also fall into this category...just call things predictive analytics or bayesian machine learning or the precise term for what you are doing already. if it's a tuple, call it a tuple already..having something be called a 'data dump' is much more refreshing than it being called 'big data' -- on the condition that data dump is the accurate definition of what is depicted.You gotta use more precise terms instead of a bloated conglomerate term that could mean everything and anything that could qualitatively be described as ""big"" and any 'thing' that could be broken down as ""data""...in the same vein, any hard discipline could be classified as a ""science,"" which would also make the term ""data science"" obsolete as well because a lot of disciplines are sciences and they generate data....All these candy conferences with 'big data' in their title are there to introduce the topic to the layman or to the businessmen with investment money trying to upscale and sigma six their business. It's a double edged sword because machine learning, algorithms, and automation will lay off half their staff. The people whose jobs are in jeopardy would rather turn away from the technology and do busy-work for the rest of their lives instead of retraining for industryI have a pet peeve with corporations refusing/neglecting to implement some of this machine learning, algorithms, and automation correctly to their business model while adapting to the times...programming needs to be taught in school and treated as importantly as studying a foreign language. MBAs need coding classes to get their feet wet into the business world of tomorrow..data analytics is a start...I also have a pet peeve with too many companies trying to save money by hiring no-name consulting companies-who-claim-what-they-know-what-they-are-doing but fall sub par with industrial standards to the point that the progress never develops and these money-conscious companies subsequently shy away from hiring true talent or established companies that could upgrade them properly because they are afraid to put value and invest in the future.Some conservative companies actively try to suppress this technology due to their ""higher morals"" when the money that the company can save can pay off their severance packages...not to mention that you and I are both wasting our adult lives at work doing the mindless tasks that could be automated..it's hard to let go but do you want to be a pencil pusher for the rest of your career? time is money and we're wasting both. Time to retrain for industry and do something worthwhile that has greater impact and brings higher sense of self  something that you always wanted to do while sustaining your bottom line...because after all, life is too short";It's gotten to the point that it's more like a joke between me and my only data-sciency work colleague, or cringy when I listen to other people using it seriously and out-of-place#Yep, big data is too often being used like you used je ne sais quoi, to appear educated in front of everyone else ^^#Yes. #Haha! Agree. Everyone is a Data Scientist:  from the graduate with a degree in Economics to a Business Analyst. #what sort of solutions do you suggest would change this misguided overuse of the DS/Big Data/ML etc?
datascience;6d0m9t;1495610320.0;/r/datascience/comments/6d0m9t/which_query_language_and_knowledge_carries_more/;Which query language and knowledge carries more importance in Data Science: Relational Databases or NoSQL DB's ?;I am already familiar with ORACLE SQL due to my work, and have been recently learning Cassandra DB and CQL(again, learning it for work).I was just curious to know as to which one carries more emphasis when we look at it from a data science​ perspective. I know that once we go into the field of Big Data, NoSQL DB's are the way to go, but still I have this small inkling of doubt. Should I invest more energy into learning Cassandra if I want a future in Data Science, or should I improve my skills in Oracle? Also as a bonus, could someone elaborate on the skill set required for a data scientist/analyst from either of those? For example: I know all about querying  and creating various DDL and DML queries in Oracle. I have also started some courses recently to learn SQL tuning(out of self-interest). Would these skills be enough to sustain myself in the future when I move into data science field ? Thanks in advance for your replies !!;Understanding set theory is probably never going to hurt (aside from the suffering incurred on the journey to understanding). The shape/structure in which the data is stored will necessitate focusing on different query strategies, but many of the key concepts remain. Basically, I don't really see it as a binary choice. You're likely going to work with both. Optimize your study for what you specifically want to do, that is the stack a target employer uses. Otherwise you may be engaging in premature optimization. Or just ignore this comment because I model software first, data second.#Have little experience with NoSQL myself, so from my frog-perspective ...  - A lot of the big data applications are based on or closely related to the SQL stack (e.g. ETL). Databases will also remain the preferable solution to store structured data for the foreseeable future, meaning they will remain the source for many datasets. This also points to one of it's prime limitations: it's not able to handle unstructured data very well (text, images, video, etc).  - Not every problem can be handled efficiently using SQL, wouldn't want to do text analyses or a logistic regression in it. It has limited maths build in and will require c additions to perform complex calculations.  Generally, i would say SQL can be used for retrieving input & storing output, but will barely allow analyses (compare how much times it takes to study a dataset in pure SQL compared with a regular Excel pivot). I don't know if the same applies to NoSQL

Now there is [evidence](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win) that both winning campaigns used sinister and sophisticated digital advertising to manipulate people's perceptions on a highly individual basis.

The people behind these powerful campaigns are not grassroots campaigners, but a [billionaire with links to Trump and other Republicans] (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage).

I believe this is a serious threat to democracy, as it relies on an invasion of our privacy in order to work, and on manipulating us rather than informing us. Theresa May has refused to give interviews to national media including Channel 4 news and BBC Radio, and has refused to debate any of the rival candidates. If she wins the General Election by manipulating people through facebook 'dark ads' rather than by defending the party's policies against proper scrutiny from her fellow citizens, then is our [democracy under threat](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy)? ;I want to start a fund to just bombard people aged 34-65 in marginals with negative Tory articles on Facebook.

startups;6cz67v;1495590718.0;/r/startups/comments/6cz67v/mysql_database_backbone_has_facebook_reduced_the/;MySQL database backbone: Has Facebook reduced the cost of scaling?;"Hello r/startups! It has taken me way too long to find this sub, so this first post will be both my introduction and my first questions!Here's where I'm at: I'm designing a mobile app/web platform which will be data-based, and rely heavily on relational database structures. *The first decision* I made on my own: starting out, I'm going to keep the data in-house and run the backend myself. The issue here is **data** is the core value of the company  the 'technology' being developed for this can easily be replicated by anybody else who understands RDB's. Utilizing hosting providers and cloud services like AWS and Azure sounded good at first, but not when they might become competitors in the future. Why would I want my company's most valuable asset sitting on another company's servers?**Now the real question:** What kind of technology do I build it on? The top 3 picks for RDB's are Oracle, MS SQL, and MySQL. The first two have awesome technology, but means being locked into a proprietary system for all of eternity. **Pros:** rest assured, the tech will scale up big and fast. **Cons:** eternally beholden to another company's whims, price gouges, and fuck-ups. Then there's the open-source option, **MySQL.** Now this seems *appealing* for many reasons, namely the technology is so good now that the differences between Oracle vs. MySQL and MS SQL vs. MySQL are minimal, save a few special features. OSS also means free as in beer, forever with no contract, and access to the [source code](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server) for custom changes. It sounds perfect, right? I've been thinking of the biggest **pitfalls** of this option. First the obvious ones, OSS means practically no support  if something breaks, you have to rely on your team to get it running again. This means hiring developers of the core RDBMS to keep the bugs under control within a timely manner. Second is ownership. I'm no expert on licenses, but as I understand it, all these contributions from the developers you pay also become OSS for everybody else as well. (These two things I'm honestly not too worried about, like I said before the value of this company will mostly be the data, not the technology it's built on.)However there's one final concern: **MySQL and scalability.** I've heard Facebook has gone through nightmares to scale MySQL up to Facebook size with the performance they have. Something to do with the core tech of SQL itself never foresaw the ""big data"" revolution requiring clusters of hundreds of servers to host one database, thus requiring you to ""shard"" the MySQL over several servers.That sounds really sloppy and difficult to work with, but is it? Is it really? After all, this is how Facebook operates today, and [they've put more work into MySQL](https://github.com/facebook/mysql-5.6) than anybody else. It may sound sloppy in theory, but if they've refined it in practice and it works well, who cares? After all, the only alternatives are **Oracle** or **MS SQL.**What do you guys think? Is MySQL still the best choice for a kinda-Facebook-alike data company? Or do you think if their devs were here today and could build it new again from scratch, they would choose a different technology?Thank you braving through a long-winded post! Cheers!";"When I did consulting, I would respond to these questions with simple ""Tell me why Postgres won't work?"". MySQL is pretty anemic compared to PostgreSQL.  The most important factors in choosing a database is understanding how your data model will behave. FB was able to scale MySQL because they implemented a flat table structure with single line inserts and selects (avoiding joins). But that's only relevant when you have to start sharding indexes, which isn't that important at this point. FB also had unique growing pains around other data issues and made large advancements in handling graph queries, analytic databases, and projects like Cassandra.  I can't agree that Oracle, MSSQL, and MySQL are on equal footing technically; I see them as very different beasts. At the minimum each has unique aspects of their SQL syntax.  OSS does not mean 'no support', it means that support comes from companies that don't own the license. Cloudera just IPO'd, and their entire business model is providing support for Hadoop.   Most likely, you are not going to be contributing to the core projects of any open source DB. You'll be building your application on top of the DB. Creating a table in PGSQL doesn't count as contributing to PGSQL.  In terms of competitors, I promise you that Amazon does not care about you. If they do want to compete with you, it will be far down the road. And if that's a concern, then use something like Softlayer, Digital Ocean, or Linode. I tend to believe that startups should focus on building the things that don't exist, not focusing on solved problems.#>After all, the only alternatives are Oracle or MS SQL.  Never heard of Postgres?  Also Facebook is now operating over way more than just MySQL, they didn't create Cassandra for now reason.#you're worrying about problems you don't have or may never have.  Come back down to reality.  Host on Aurora and focus on your product and customer acquisition.  If you get big enough migrate off#Tech stacks involve a lot of personal opinion. For every person who insists MySQL is a great move, someone will tell you it's a terrible move.  You need to take everything with a grain of salt as no one is objectively better.  The one thing I feel you could objectively state is, Oracle is an objectively bad move for a startup. I say this as someone who has done a lot of Oracle consultations: The target of the product has always been large financial and legal firms. It's entirely possible you multiple millions of dollars worth of funds to burn, but if you don't, my sales contacts aren't interested in being referred to you."

IWantOut;6dp2b4;1495908143.0;/r/IWantOut/comments/6dp2b4/us_academicuniversity_employment/;US -> ?. Academic/university employment?;Hi all,I'm interested in leaving the US once I finish my PhD. I have a few friends that have gone to Europe for post-docs, but all returned to the US for faculty/professor jobs. If possible, I'd like to stay abroad. I apologize if this field might be a little unusual for this sub, but I have a couple of years left till I get my degree and anything I can start doing as far as preparation, experience, or contacts, I'd like to get a head start!I really only speak English, but I'm told that's OK because often classes are taught in English in many countries (true?). My degree will give me skills in molecular biology, wildlife biology, conservation, and computing/big data.I was thinking of looking somewhere in northern Europe, and I know that I would be very limited by what universities are hiring for positions I can fill, but I'm curious if people here know countries anywhere that might be notably easier or harder to get a job (long-term) in a university/research capacity.Thanks!;"At the masters level stuff is usually in English, but at the undergrad level it's generally in the local language. For academia, if they want you, visas aren't going to be an issue. Last time I was in Germany I knew plenty of post docs who didn't know enough to teach in German. I don't think post docs generally teach?#I left the US for a postdoc in Denmark and I'm still here working almost 5 years later in a permanent position.  So this is possible - most people go back to the US because if you actually want a faculty position, it's a hell of a lot easier in the US than over here (and you'd also have to speak the local language fluently to teach).  And if you're thinking ""well it's not easy in the US""...well then there you go - it's even worse here. Plus the pay for PhD-level positions in industry is better in the US than over here.  The only reason I'm still here is because my husband, who is a citizen of another EU country, is doing a PhD and it may be the easiest place for both of us to remain employed in the same place for the time being.    There are some English-language courses but in most countries in northern/western Europe, they are required by law in most public programs to hold undergraduate courses in the local language.  In Denmark at least 95% of them are in Danish and as you can imagine, that means the majority of the faculty positions that require teaching will require fluency in Danish (and good luck getting fluent in Danish while doing a postdoc).  What few may exist somewhere that don't require it - well you can imagine that the competition for these is even greater, as there are a ton of foreigners doing postdocs in all these countries, and everyone speaks English - both locals and foreigners alike.  I've known a handful of professors who were recruited here without speaking Danish, and they were required to learn it within a short time, but these professors were senior people with decades of experience.  They don't hire any fresh assistant professors who don't already speak Danish.#For a post-doc level you should be fine with English only. For faculty positions, they typically ask that you speak the local language within a few years, as teaching (bachelors) is almost always in the local language.  Western/northern Europe is hard for faculty positions, as the competition is killing, but again, will depend strongly on the field.  The best thing you can do for now as preparation is network abroad. Go to all possible conferences, give talks, socialise with everybody that runs a group etc."

careerguidance;6frnzn;1496816240.0;/r/careerguidance/comments/6frnzn/does_it_make_sense_for_me_to_go_back_to_school_to/;Does it make sense for me to go back to school to study data science?;Hi everyone, thanks for taking a moment to give some advice. I graduated at 22 with a degree in economics. I spent 2 years trying to become a teacher but decided it wasn't for me. I've spent the last 5 years of my life floating around between jobs, not sure of my long-term career goals. I've been a travel agent, sold advertising, done mental health support, never more than 7 months before my current job. I've been working for a major insurance company as a sales agent in the after hours center. The pay is great, the hours are very flexible and I like the people, but I find the work to be pretty dull and repetitive. Despite this, I'm performing well and successful at selling. I'm looking for a career more suited to my analytical, problem solving mindset. I love working through problems and I'm fascinated with big data and potentially working in technology. I have been reading into the career field of Data Science and I find it to be really interesting. My company offers education reimbursement of $6,000 per year. The problem is that I have no experience with programming and minimal experience with data programs. How realistic is it to go back to school to get another degree? Is it worth it going into debt of between $10,000 to $30,000 and spending multiple more years in school? With a bachelor's, can I go straight to a master's or would a bachelor's be required? Are there opportunities to get mentoring or internship opportunities? Any recommended resources on education, job opportunities and general advice?;Head over to /r/datascience. The sub is absolutely inundated with posts by people in your position.   I am a data scientist, so I feel moderately qualified to speak on this. Data scientists build data products. If you want to be an analyst, that will require less education.   Unless you took a lot of math and stats in college, you aren't qualified to apply to any respectable graduate programs in economics. If you can find a respectable grad program that teaches you Hadoop, R, SQL, and Python _at a minimum_, then do your damnedest to get into that program. Otherwise, go for another bachelor'a degree.   If you just want to be a data analyst, you should probably do a M.S. Business Analytics open to people of all majors. They're usually really good programs for who they're educating. You won't come out of it a stats wiz or programming god, but you'll have a degree and some marketable skills.   But seriously, /r/datascience can elaborate. I'm just some jerk waiting for his oil change.   Oh, and is it worth going into debt? I know data scientists who work in London, Paris, and Seattle. You can get a job in any major city. Zillow in Seattle pays entry-level data scientists anywhere from $100,000-$115,000 starting out. That is not uncommon in Seattle.   So as long as you're serious, you will earn back any debt you take on in the first two years. #You don't normally need to get a second bachelor's to go into a master's program, even if the bachelor's is unrelated.  I don't know much about data science degrees, but I wanted to throw out there that you should look at graduate degrees in economics.  I have a few friends who got their PhDs in economics and it was basically a degree in applied statistics.  One of them got an analyst job at a health insurance company upon graduation.  So I think your Bachelor's in Economics might be an excellent background for that kind of thing.  If you were a good student in undergrad, have a look at PhD programs.  A lot of PhD programs are free and you get a stipend for the 5 years you are a student.  It's not a lot, around $30,000 a year, but you don't accumulate any debt either.  If you think a masters is better, go to a job site and search for MS in Data Science to find out what jobs require one.  If you don't see a lot of jobs that want it, or the jobs don't look interesting, then maybe it's not a great career move.

I originally thought I wanted to go into medicine (either med school or research) and after my AmeriCorps year, I saw a much more interesting opportunity to pivot into big data/business analytics (in healthcare). To be completely honest, not sure if I should consider the MBA because of opportunity costs, but the notion has been on my mind for some time.Target schools: Top 5-10 schools, figured if I don't go for these schools then the returns are greatly diminished for me.EDIT: Also worth noting, been looking more into the MBA/MPP program offered by Harvard Kennedy and partner MBA programs (H/S/W/Sloan). I think right out of the MBA, I'm interested in getting involved in consulting or PE that are involved in social work.;I think if you can figure out a little better why you want to get an MBA then it will show you what schools are a good fit for you. Right now it seems like you are wishy-washy on the whole idea, and if that's the case an MBA might not be right for you. Plus adcoms can usually see through that.  But if all I'm seeing is top 5-10 schools and social sector/non-profit I guess Yale is probably your school.#You've got a profile that's competitive for top 16 schools: good undergrad, name brand employers, good GMAT (assuming you can nail it). GPA isn't great, but it's only one factor.  So apply to 2-3 M7 schools, and 2-3 top 16 ex M7 schools. Exactly which ones you apply to is up to personal preference#Hey man, HBS social enterprise type here-- I think you have the building blocks of a winning HSWB profile here, maybe this cycle or the next one.   Honestly, I was also skeptical of the MBA and it's opportunity cost, but there is really no better vehicle for switching careers. The doors it opens are incredible and you can even start networking for the job after your post-MBA job while still in school. That's how much access you get and how eager employers are to talk to you. I think a top tier MBA is especially important for government and social sector people because it lets us switch out of those sectors later if we find they are not the right fit.  In any event inner the success of your app will come down to narrative. If your comfortable sharing details DM me and I can give them a look.
AskDocs;6eqiet;1496357856.0;/r/AskDocs/comments/6eqiet/what_information_do_doctors_need_hypothetical/;What Information Do Doctors Need? (hypothetical);"Hi AskDocs, this is my first time visiting this sub, so bear with me if my question is best suited to another sub, is inane, or has been asked a million times already. I am an IT guy and tinkerer in general and have been pondering something nonstop for a few days now: Why aren't medical smart wearables a thing? This was the basis for an idea about developing a diagnostic/data collection wearable that could gather data 24 hours a day about a user, and then that data could be used by doctors to make better, more accurate diagnoses and give very granular long term data for predicting and avoiding future medical issues. Now for some follow up questions. First, what data sets would be useful for doctors to have that a wearable could collect? Heart rate minute by minute? Sleep schedule/quality? Blood pressure? Temperature? What non-invasive sensors exist that could be integrated into a wearable that I don't know about? Not being a medical professional, I am probably out of the loop on these sorts of things, so if there have been developments recently that haven't made it to an audience outside of the specialized fields in which they are researched and developed, what would be the best sources for information? Any other considerations or parameters that a doctor might think of that my economics degree and IT experience haven't primed me to think of? This idea is zygotic at this point, I have no means of constructing or developing a wearable of this caliber or function currently. This is just an idea that has been stuck in my brain for a few days now, and I can't help but think that it should be possible to leverage big data sets and advanced data analysis to help with diagnosis and prevention and that something should be feasible in a relatively unobtrusive device like a smartwatch or even a more feature rich ""constellation"" of devices (wristband, earbud, chest-band, brain activity sensor, eye tracker, maybe even an implanted or semi-implanted device of some kind?). Anyway, This is just the start and I'm sure I'll have more questions later but this can be the beginning of a conversation (that sounds like a u/PhillyDeFranco catchphrase). Thanks In advance to any that make it through this wall of text and any that respond! ";"You know what would be more useful?  An accurate Past Medical History, including surgeries, allergies and said reaction to, and up-to-date listing of medications, dosage and frequency.  I wished I had a dollar for every time a patient told me ""oh, it's all in the computer"" and it is so NOT all in the computer.  All of the visits to the neurologist, orthopedist, and that cardiologist in Columbus are not there.  Half the medications were bought from CVS and the other half mail order, those are hit and miss, especially if they came from different providers.  I am imaging something that the patient carries around and is updated at every visit to the doctor, hospital, and pharmacy.  Much more boring from an IT perspective, but so helpful. #You would need accurate senors and a way to convert them to accurate values and that they be small enough to wear.  Look at fitness wearables and their innacuracy.  If the sensors were available, I could see products using them and reported to your doctor."

Both courses will be similar (both sound useless for employment prospects, frankly) and I'd discourage you from both unless you want to do a PhD after. Also, I'd recommend an MRes rather than an MSc.   If you're hellbent on the MSc, I would look at how long the 40-credit project is and how long you would have to work on the project is.  At both of those universities, the MSc students will be seen as a burden and the real researchers will avoid them as they'd be a distraction compared to real research produced by the PhD students.

Here we will look at what is required to get started with Big Data and the rational behind it.There are a lot of information on the internet to get started with each one of them and it is easy to get lost. So, the references to get started with those technologies are also included.**Linux** : Big Data (the Hadoop revolution) started on the Linux OS. Even now most of the Big Data software’s are initially developed on Linux and porting to Windows has been an after thought.Microsoft partnered with Hortonworks to speed up the porting of the Big Data software’s to Windows.To get started with the latest software’s around Big Data, knowledge of Linux is a must. The good thing about Linux is that it is free and it opens up a lot of opportunities.There are more than 100 different flavors of Linux and Ubuntu is one of the popular distribution to get started for those who are new to Linux.**Java** : Most of the Big Data software’s are developed in Java. I say most, exceptions are Spark has been developed in Scala, Impala has been developed in C/C++ and so on.To extend the Big Data software’s knowledge of Java is a must. Also, sometimes the documentation might not be up to mark and so it might be required to go through the underlying code for the Big Data software to see how some thing works or is not working as the way it is expected to.For the above mentioned reasons knowledge of Java is must. Basics of core Java is enough, knowledge of enterprise Java is not required.Java programs can be developed with as simple as notepad. But, developing in an IDE like Eclipse makes it a piece of cake.**SQL** : Not everyone is comfortable with programming in Java and other languages. That’s the reason why SQL abstractions have been introduced on top of the different Big Data frameworks. Those who are from a database background can get very easily started with Big Data because of the SQL abstraction. Hive, Impala, Phoenix are few of such software’s.*Others* : The above mentioned skills are good enough to get started with Big Data. As one gets into more and more at Big Data, would also recommend to look at R, Python and Scala. Each of these languages have got their strength and weakness and depending upon the requirement the appropriate option can be picked to write Big Data programs.To become good at Big Data it’s required for an aspirant to have a good overview of the different technologies and the above guide mentions what is required and where to start reading about them.;

We're a medium sized (~250 person) company based in NYC and have been around since 2000. I like to explain our product in the following way… Imagine Microsoft Excel (a tabular spreadsheet view of data). Put that in a web browser so we have something similar to Google Sheets. Now take 100 billion - 1 trillion rows of data, put them in a single spreadsheet, and maintain the ability to manipulate that data in real time. You can create new columns that are a function of other columns, filter and aggregate the data, run more advanced statistical analyses, visualize the data, or build a data driven web application. That's the Trillion Row Spreadsheet and it's the core product that the rest of our business is built around. Most of our server side code is written in k, which is a pretty cool language that I'm not going to discuss at length. k is an excellent tool for vector processing and distributed computing, but there are some tasks it's not well suited for, and that's where this job post becomes relevant. The Core Group at 1010data (the devs that build the product described above) includes the ""Interfacing Team"" which is responsible for two things. First, we solve the problems that k isn't well suited for. This consists of implementing some of the very high performance bits of the system that don't vectorize well, as well as integrating third party tools as to avoid reinvention of the wheel (we didn't feel the need to implement AES in k). Second, we build the code distributed to customers (k is interpreted, we generally don't like to distribute the interpreter). This code is (again) very performance sensitive, but also must be very portable (we've targeted Windows, Linux, OSX, AIX, and HP-UX to name a few targets). Put most simply, the Interfacing Team is responsible for the code that isn't written in k or JavaScript (though we do in fact do some k programming).So what are we looking for? We want someone with C/C++/other-manually-memory-managed-language programming experience who is interested in building high performance tools and libraries for manipulating big data. Generally we look favorably on people with STEM degrees, though there is some preference for people with a computer science background (you're going to be asked algorithm questions and for Big-O analyses during the interview process).  We have positions open at the entry level, though we certainly won't turn away those with deeper experience.If you're interested you can reach out to me directly, or apply via our [careers page](https://www.1010data.com/company/careers/open-positions/position/?id=599812). I am the hiring manager for the team (so I won't get any sort of bonus for applications through that link) but reaching out to me directly can skip some of the recruiting rigmarole. Note that this position is on-site so you'd have to live in or at least within a reasonable distance of New York City.";

The most popular careers for this type are in: business/finance, math, engineering, and computer science.Anyone have any ideas how I could blend one of these with nutrition? Like with data science maybe? Here's a link to the INTJ career description:https://www.truity.com/personality-type/INTJ/careersI truly think I would be good at one of these careers...I love to analyze haha.;The Myers Briggs personality test is not psychologically accurate. Do not take careers advice from a test with no basis. Sure be aware of who you are, your goals, strengths and limitations. But don't trust the MB test, it's been debunked.

You could create a range of career production numbers.Example  Fournette: Projected 8,000 to 12,000 career rushing yards, 50 to 100 TDs over 8 to 12 years;A lot changes year to year, projections for the upcoming year are enough of a crapshoot, trying to push that further would be even worse.

On the other hand, significant number of companies do have this differentiation. In general, here are the factors that in my opinion can separate the two-Here are my Top 10 Pointers to ensure durable success in either field–* Learn as much as possible. Spend 4 to 5 hours every week on the learning and development and knowing the latest in the industry.* Challenge status quo. Never assume that whatever is being done is following the most effective approach.* Believe that you are equal to everybody else in the hierarchy. Don’t be afraid to speak your mind* Focus on Innovation and coming out with the earth shattering ideas rather than doing the business as usual.* Focus on developing great communication skills and soft skill as this is one of the biggest gap I have seen in the analytics professionals.* Don’t become a one trick pony. try to get exposure in different industries and different functional areas.* Participate in competitions and events such as Kaggle, to know where you stand vis a vis your peer group.* Try to write white papers and blogs on your subject matter expertise.* Develop domain expertise as without that analytics is not effective.* Finally, always maintain a clear visibility of your strength and opportunities and any blind spots.

I need to encrypt datasets for storage as well as in-transit. The idea is that a person that has sensitive data might need to send it to someone else who is collaborating. So they need to be able to encrypt (large datasets) in a sane amount of time and send it which can be received and used. For storage encryption, I looked at hadoop transparent encryption, but dont know how (or even if) it works for in-transit data. I need to learn more about security in big data too.So my 2 questions are :1. How to encrypt large datasets which are going to be in-transit? (without assuming much about hardware/software availability)2. Any security standards or other related info regarding big data.;Hpe securedata might be of use.  Encrypt close to the source as possible then have them call to decrypt it via ldap authorization. This secures it at rest and in transit as it encrypts before landing.

For those that don't have the time to read the whole report but have an interest in the subject, here is the conclusion:  >The Social Credit System embodies China’s vision to create a highly effective and, at the same time, adaptive economy under political leadership. If implemented as planned, the system has the potential to become the most globally sophisticated and fine-tuned model for IT-backed and big data-enabled market regulation. It would deeply transform the Chinese economy and provide China’s policymakers with a tool to effectively and rapidly react to upcoming social and environmental challenges as well as to new technologies and industrial developments.   >China’s government will attempt to use the Social Credit System to channel investment into cutting-edge technologies and to steer companies into patterns of behavior useful in solving social and environmental problems. This could, in turn, accelerate leapfrogging processes, innovative business activities, and the Chinese society’s ability to quickly adapt to unforeseen changes.  In this case, Western market economies, in comparison, would appear slow-moving and highly fragmented, with a weak capacity for implementation and lacking in long-term strategy. In the vision of China’s leadership, liberal market economies would ultimately not be able to compete with the Chinese unidirectional approach. Yet China’s vision of comprehensively steering economic activities is very ambitious.   >The project will not necessarily be crowned with success. Given its limitations and weaknesses, the Social Credit System might just as easily result in a massive decline in investments, the failure of whole industries, low innovative power, and little entrepreneurial initiative. Whether or not the Chinese approach will prove to be better suited to the technological, social, and environmental challenges of the 21st century remains to be seen. It is certain, however, that the Chinese leadership is fully committed to investing everything necessary in order for its mammoth Social Credit System project to succeed.

The gathering information is expected to be reduced to OSINT and SaaS.I'm the same geek as you. When I have questions I go and ask this issues to community.I would like to know your opinion on the following questions:1. What do you feel about what do this services (Censys, Shodan, ZoomEye, etc)? (from a moral point of view)2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of these services compared to each other? I would be grateful if you advice me alternatives.3. Is there an underground spirit in them?4. Why these services don't work with crypto-currencies?5. Why these services don't try to work on the ipv6 address space?6. Why they don't scan all ports?I'm interested to hear your opinion.";Ok, since nobody else has responded.  Morally? They are the only ethical thing to do. Obscurity is not security. By exposing these services in an easy to use manner we are increasing the overall visibility so the community can use this tool for good. Any service can be used incorrectly but that doesn't mean it is immoral. Isn't it moral to own a gun to protect your family, while guns can be used for crime?  Honestly shodan is the strongest. It has the best filtering and most features. The api is very coherant, but it could be faster.   There is indeed an underground spirit. I have personally talked to the founder of shodan and he is an awesome dude, very salt of the earth, comes directly from the hacking community.  They dont take coins for the same reason many people don't, it can be inconvenient.  And for the same reason they don't scan every port they can't scan ipv6. The raw bandwidth is massive to scan the minimal set they currently scan.  Alternatives? Really if shodan doesn't meet your needs, you need to build your own solution. A combo of masscan and nmap exported to csv, and then say converted into json and fed into something like elastic search would give you the feature set of shodan with your own custom dataset. If you want to build a gui around it that shouldnt be too difficult. if you need to target a service that isn't on shodan, thats your way to go. VPS for scanning with a provider that is friendly is cheap and you get your data in real time.

Metal in the morning, Chopin the next? Searching for ABC all the time, then switching to XYZ? And so on? What does happen in such cases? ;Chances are unless a lot of other people switch habits in a similar way, it won't be able to make meaningful predictions about that person.  Big data is an interesting subject that has the potential to reveal a lot about human behaviours, with all manner of potential efficency savings and other improvements coming about as a result. What it can't do is predict things about specific individuals with a high degree of accuracy. It is however pretty good when dealing with big groups. (Almost like a crude version of issac asimovs 'psychohistory' concept). Think of it like this-if you watch a lot of science fiction movies it might predict you're likely to like the lord of the rings movies. There's no guarantee you will, but if a lot of sci-fi fans like fantasy as well then statistically there's a good chance you will to.

With voices though I find it very surprising that people can't use big data to tell an AI system all the different ways people say words and the context in which they're used. If you look at YouTube's auto-caption or auto-translate software it sometimes gets things right but usually it's either broken grammar or complete nonsense. I get that it's probably very hard to do but with all these amazing companies trying to tackle this problem I just find it amazing that we haven't progressed further with this. ;"It's an extremely difficult task, have you ever tried to understand someone who just learned english? It's similar, and on top of that AI is very young and is a whole other item to tackle the short answer is they're learning how to play baseball while watching a football movie and sitting in a gymnasium for Basketball.#> I get that it's probably very hard to do but with all these amazing companies trying to tackle this problem I just find it amazing that we haven't progressed further with this.  As a general rule asking ""Why isn't this technology more advanced?"" is about as deep a question as asking ""Why isn't the world a better place?""  The tech isn't better because nobody has made it better, probably because they don't know how. People have been making it better for years and they didn't just choose to make it less good than they could for no reason. ""But they are so smart!"" isn't a meaningful criticism of our current progress.#Your brain is humongous.  In comparison to any computer you're likely to be able to carry it's billions of times more powerful.  With such a powerful processor it takes years of skilled education from your parents and teachers to teach you a language.  Really understanding Shakespeare or Melville takes knowledge of huge amounts of data.  Language is abstract, and that makes it much more difficult than games like chess or Go.  The degrees of freedom are orders of magnitude harder.  Sure, Minsky promised universal translation in 10 years in the 1960s.  Other than that he was a genius."

We're a medium sized (~250 person) company located in midtown east (46th & 3rd) and have been around since 2000. I like to explain our product in the following way… Imagine Microsoft Excel (a tabular spreadsheet view of data). Put that in a web browser so we have something similar to Google Sheets. Now take 100 billion - 1 trillion rows of data, put them in a single spreadsheet, and maintain the ability to manipulate that data in real time. You can create new columns that are a function of other columns, filter and aggregate the data, run more advanced statistical analyses, visualize the data, or build a data driven web application. That's the Trillion Row Spreadsheet and it's the core product that the rest of our business is built around.Most of our server side code is written in k, which is a pretty cool language that I'm not going to discuss at length. k is an excellent tool for vector processing and distributed computing, but there are some tasks it's not well suited for, and that's where this job post becomes relevant. The Core Group at 1010data (the devs that build the product described above) includes the ""Interfacing Team"" which is responsible for two things. First, we solve the problems that k isn't well suited for. This consists of implementing some of the very high performance bits of the system that don't vectorize well, as well as integrating third party tools as to avoid reinvention of the wheel (we didn't feel the need to implement AES in k). Second, we build the code distributed to customers (k is interpreted, we generally don't like to distribute the interpreter). This code is (again) very performance sensitive, but also must be very portable (we've targeted Windows, Linux, OSX, AIX, and HP-UX to name a few targets). Put most simply, the Interfacing Team is responsible for the code that isn't written in k or JavaScript (though we do in fact do some k programming).So what are we looking for? We want someone with C/C++/other-manually-memory-managed-language programming experience who is interested in building high performance tools and libraries for manipulating big data. Generally we look favorably on people with STEM degrees, though there is some preference for people with a computer science background (you're going to be asked algorithm questions and for Big-O analyses during the interview process).  We have positions open at the entry level, though we certainly won't turn away those with deeper experience.If you're interested you can reach out to me directly, or apply via our [careers page](https://www.1010data.com/company/careers/open-positions/position/?id=599812). I am the hiring manager for the team (so I won't get any sort of bonus for applications through that link) but reaching out to me directly can skip some of the recruiting rigmarole.";

You can reply directly to the position in Angel co link or feel free to send me a message if you'd like to know more. Please no recruiters. If you reply to the Angel .co listing just mention that you saw this post on reddit please.Besides all of the technical requirements listed in the description the person we hire will have a good understanding of general user experience and best practices.

Our NYC office currently has about 15 devs/engineers and is growing quickly.

It's an awesome, complex operation that they are working on and the team needs another Senior PHP developer who has worked on this scale before. You will need expert PHP skills that don't always require a framework to be optimized and a high comfort level writing SQL queries to work full-stack(and no, you won't be a DBA). If this sounds interesting to you, PM me so I can give you more info. I just hired a QA engineer to this team and he says he is growing tremendously there.

TrueReddit;5w9gyn;1488102808.0;/r/TrueReddit/comments/5w9gyn/robert_mercer_the_big_data_billionaire_waging_war/;Robert Mercer: the big data billionaire waging war on mainstream media;;"Computer scientist turned Republican superdonor, Robert Mercer is the shadowy billionaire figure who was the top donor to President Trump's campaign. His associate Steve Bannon is now the senior White House advisor.       This story details how Mercer utilized his computer science background to fund one of the growing political forces in our nation. Mercer has bankrolled major media upstarts like Breitbart, big data companies like Cambridge Analytica that utilized AI and pattern recognition to help sway the vote in both Brexit and later the US election, and building an army of Twitter bots and pro-Trump websites that will drown out mainstream media as ""fake news"" and replace it with their own alternate reality of how the world is. #[This](https://scout.ai/story/the-rise-of-the-weaponized-ai-propaganda-machine) article is a nice summary of what Cambridge Analytica did.  ""By leveraging automated emotional manipulation alongside swarms of bots, Facebook dark posts, A/B testing, and fake news networks, a company called Cambridge Analytica has activated an invisible machine that preys on the personalities of individual voters to create large shifts in public opinion. Many of these technologies have been used individually to some effect before, but together they make up a nearly impenetrable voter manipulation machine that is quickly becoming the new deciding factor in elections around the world.  Most recently, Analytica helped elect U.S. President Donald Trump, secured a win for the Brexit Leave campaign, and led Ted Cruz’s 2016 campaign surge, shepherding him from the back of the GOP primary pack to the front.  The company is owned and controlled by conservative and alt-right interests that are also deeply entwined in the Trump administration. The Mercer family is both a major owner of Cambridge Analytica and one of Trump’s biggest donors. Steve Bannon, in addition to acting as Trump’s Chief Strategist and a member of the White House Security Council, is a Cambridge Analytica board member. Until recently, Analytica’s CTO was the acting CTO at the Republican National Convention. ""#This is great research and reporting. It fills in some gaps for me.  #All of this stuff is really overblown. It's nice, fits into a narrative of shady billionaires psycographically manipulating people and entering their minds etc etc but there isn't actually much to it beyond pseudo conspiracy theory narratives.   Clinton's campaign, for a start, [had access to a lot more information due to having the databases that Obama's team had built over the previous elections](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-01/trump-s-secret-sauce-is-just-more-ketchup) (except for a lot of data that the Obama team had used in a third party app that allowed them to target specific people, which Facebook banned because they considered it's use unethical.)The Obama team are the original masters of this sort of stuff, and it's likely that if there were an information/data disparity, it would have favoured the Clinton campaign. There were some shady things Trumps team did regarding 'dark posts', attempts at voter suppression, but there's no evidence they had any effect. Social media is a great way to reach people, but it is not yet really a great way to read them.  Regarding Brexit, it's even further off. [Dominic Cummings](https://twitter.com/odysseanproject/status/832992607836000256), the head of the leave campaign and an expert on data use in campaigns, has also said that [Anything you read about Cambridge Analytica, 'psychographics', & social media in politics is ~99% likely to be bullshit](https://twitter.com/odysseanproject/status/831826387241693185) because the [Big5 personality adds relatively little predictive pwr. Demographics overwhelmingly more important for predicting &/or digital comms](https://twitter.com/odysseanproject/status/831826800892338177).  If you read Cummings' [20,000 word post on the referendum, in which he outlines the techniques thy used](https://dominiccummings.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/on-the-referendum-21-branching-histories-of-the-2016-referendum-and-the-frogs-before-the-storm-2/) or read Shipmans book on Brexit [All Out War](https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Out-War-Britains-Political/dp/0008215154/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488120151&sr=8-1&keywords=all+out+war) you'll see that the Brexit campaign focused mostly on demographics, with Vote Leave geo-targeting people between the ages of 35-55, who lived outside of Scotland, London and areas with high UKIP vote. They did this with a massive social media post blitz in the last 5 days of the campaign, a strategy they called 'Waterloo'. (E: note this was not the sole reason they won, when votes are as close as they are in Brexit or in the Trump election, it isn't really possible to reach 'one single reason' as to why something happened, despite our natural human bias to seek simple narratives that help us understand complex things.)  Again, there's a nice narrative here, and Cambridge Analytica do all they can to play into it, with their University town/fake latin word name, and a shady posh english bloke doing their presentations, they have crafted themselves a niche as the evil geniuses out of an 80's action movie. But there is very little cold hard evidence in the article that speaks to the effectiveness of the 'big 5 traits' methods. It's not even new, its been in use in various fields for decades. #Fascinating. Thanks for sharing this OP.#Democrats were the early adopters for social media in politics, especially in 2012 - using these new technologies to influence voters.   That was ok - right?  But the GOP caught up and got better at it - and thats bad, right?  Sore losers.#>a determined plutocrat and a brilliant media strategist can, and have, found a way to mould journalism to their own ends.  As compared to the billionaire plutocrats, who currently own the mainstream media companies, who would never use journalism to their own ends.#Brietbart as an example of taking back the culture? The publication barely follows basic journalism practices. It takes commodity stories, obscure tidbits, and recycles them as barely disguised opinion pieces. Its comment section is often a cesspool of racism, rage and ignorance.    And computer scientist? Big whoop. There are a lot of people with extraordinary computer skills out there. "
Futurology;5w3rim;1488023829.0;/r/Futurology/comments/5w3rim/deleted_by_user/;[deleted by user];[removed];"[deleted]#My question is, do we need democracy if an automated totalitarian state is able to provide for all of our needs?   Democracy is about compromises, not solutions. It never selects the best idea, just the idea that people are, on average, comfortable with. #There are a lot of interesting proposals here, and the broad trend in them to the decentralized and local i'd welcome.   That said, there are some confused attempts at philosophical underpinnings to all of this.  >>The insights of the great enlightener Immanuel Kant seem to be highly relevant here. Among other things, he noted that a state that attempts to determine the happiness of its citizens is a despot................the solution for the future is collective intelligence. Collective intelligence requires a high degree of diversity. This is, however, being reduced by today's personalized information systems, which reinforce trends.  So on the one hand, anything we do collectively in society through the state is despotism, but everybody has to be diverse in the future. Good luck, convincing all the anti-Muslim authoritarian types of the need for them to get out of their media bubbles and be more ""diverse"".  The conflict between decentralized democracy & its tendency to periodically produce authoritarian ""Great Leader"" types via the will of the people, was clearly recognized and described in ancient Greece 2,500 years ago.  It happens in exactly the way they described in the 21st century & seems to be an eternal dance, so no doubt we will see both sides play out in a world of AI.#Considering that human control has given us Trump, I look forward to our new AI overlords. #So we're heading towards a Metal Gear future, but without the giant robot fights. Man, that sucks.#If anything, big data and AI will support democracy. Because at the moment we don't even have a real democracy.#The only thing that gives me hope is the fact that with sufficient technology floating around, we can all become self sufficient. The only reason that people really want to control others is to get more resources. But when resources are, for all intents and purposes, unlimited, there is little reason for anyone to want to make such a centralized system of control.#Although I share a deep concern regarding the survival of democracy, I do not believe the threat comes directly from AI. I recently saw an old Star Trek show in which two planets had been at war for centuries and the ""war"" was performed through their respective ""computer"" systems. There was no physical damage but there were specific citizen casualties accomplished via elimination chambers. I think this story illustrates what could happen if we trade our free will and independence for the sake of security. I use security to refer to the pervasive ""homeland security"" currently implemented within America. It is our choice to live within the system we create. ""Awareness benefits survival"" I am sure some philosopher, general of late night comic has coined this phrase. I would be interested to know who ... or I will take it.#Technology in general is empowering governments and leading to authoritarianism.

learnprogramming;5wtfpe;1488346167.0;/r/learnprogramming/comments/5wtfpe/how_to_learn_big_data_tech_at_home/;How to learn big data tech at home?;[deleted];"[deleted]#> I figure Scala is what I should learn  Why? Scala doesn't suddenly do ""big data"" a ton better. If you want to start with Spark; you can just use Python. Our data scientists write all their models in Python.   I also don't see why you think you ""have"" to work on 50GB of data. You can work on smaller sets; otherwise on your local machine you'd be spending most time waiting for the process to finish. #I'm not sure there is really any specific ""big data"" things you learn. But I work with this stuff and in a previous life consulted for a load of different companies that are using big data and the general technologies I encounter and you'd need to know to do my job from the engineering/infrastructure perspective are...  Relational Databases - The basics, even with all the fancy bells and whistles most companies are still pushing all the data into a relational database (likely for convenience/legacies sake). PostGres is my personal favourite as it's what I use but if you're just using a relational database as an end point then they're all pretty much the same if you know how to use SQL.   Google Big Query - On input pretty similar to normal relational stuff but works on a slightly different concept behind the scenes where it breaks down into granularity on a very large scale. Also v useful as you can piggyback off of Google Analytics and bounce data from there and aggregate it. Read up on how it works at a deeper level (google documents stuff pretty well and there's plenty of books on it)   Elastic Search - This is a real big data technology imo if you're familiar with Java then this should be pretty easy and it's pretty simple to download and set-up and work with. Learn what an ELK stack is   Of note as I'm talking about elastic search understanding and working with JSON data is pretty essential as a concept you mention you know some Java so that's probs not too crazy.    Hadoop: I run into this a lot, e.g King Games (candy crush) use it pretty heavily to store all the data generated by their games every day that they use to do the analysis with which they change their games. Personally I'm not particularly wedded to it but it's definitely a useful thing to know about as it is one of the technologies that you can store huge amounts of shit with and it's one of the technologies that are definitely ""big data"" in terms of the concepts being used. It is also pretty specialist and obscure to learn.    Learn the concepts of parallel processing. Imo there is nothing magical about ""big data"" this is the central concept of ""scaling out not up"". That makes big data possible.    Another concept as well that's interesting is if you read up on how node based data works. Apache thrift afaik isn't what facebook actually uses but that's described in Marz's book and is good to get an idea of the concept.    In terms of books there's a very good book I own by Nathan Marz called ""Big Data: principles and best practices of scalable real time data systems"". It's good as it gives the concepts of various systems without being particularly wedded to specific codes.    As said in terms of doing it at home, if you know how to configure a  proper DwH on a small scale using big data principles if you've done it right then it'll scale out to ridiculous levels anyway without too much work (in theory lol).   If you want to build something at home you can take session data from analytics, Export it to big query, pull that data using a job of whatever sort (e.g python) analyse it using something like Elasticsearch or Spark then push the results to a relational database then that'd give you a pretty good overview on what most companies are doing in different ways, also worth noting but a lot of the non-relational systems like hadoop came about because relational wasn't able to keep up a couple of years ago but there's companies like Exasol and Oracle who do relational databases that run in parallel systems that are arguably just as good now and Postgres and open source people are catching up pretty rapidly as Postgres can be run in parallel now since 9.6 or so. #I've started writing my answer again for at least 10 times. I tried to fit in general notes about what is expected from full stack developers working in typical applications that handle huge amounts of real time data. But the topic is really way too wide.  The tricky thing in big data is rarely about the code itself. If you understand computing parallelization and are familiar with your chosen databases, you can usually get away with the basic data-pushing and analyzing part quite easily. Managing the communication and all that between all the parts of the application is often the hardest part.  It gets trickier when you have to scale horizontally. Infrastructure management and database scaling are usually the hardest topics in making high-availability, realtime, high-throughput applications. But again, there's not any specific magic bullets in here, it's just about being generally familiar and comfortable with your chosen tools.  If you want to be a full stack developer who can work with big data, you need to know about infrastructure (Linux, the tools available on Amazon and Google, virtualization techniques, etc), databases (SQL is a must, some NoSQL databases are worth it, caching techniques like using Redis are important), scaling databases and parallelizing computation (and the associated tools like Hadoop) in addition to the typical frontend and backend tools and languages. You can learn enough of all of this to be a good generalist, but it's not something that would fit into one or two books. Many people also specialize in a single topic here.  Can you be more specific about what you exactly would like to learn to do well?#You wont learn what the hell is going on with Spark if you use Scala either. Spark has HUGE abstraction, and you wont understand it unless you start understanding what's going on behind the scenes and know how distributed computing is done. #I'm not a big data guy but I think most don't solve big data problems with just one machine...it would probably take forever depending on the amount of data. Have you looked into distributed computing? I bought a rack of 5 raspberry pies, and I got practice via writing a script for one of the raspberry pies to assign work to the other 4 raspberry pies.  I did a calculation of pi via the Monte Carlo method and distributed the work amongst the 4 pis to increase speed since the problem could be solved in parallel. #The books Designing Data Intensive Applications and Big Data (the Twitter one about the lambda architecture) are both great. They give very sound reasoning on how and why things are done  Scala, Spark, and Kafka are all hot right now too so reading up on them and making a demo project would do you wonders#So the thing with spark is, its a massive platform that relies on top of different other platforms (for example, hadoop, zookeeper, yarn, or mesos, each one with its own levers  that you can setup and that sometimes arent really documented) that can be used for multiple things. Additionally, it has 3 different apis as their core (java/scala/python, not  including SparkR) with their apis varying with every version, and also varying between language implementations.  To make things best, support is spotty, with databricks forums being a dead end, the mail list being not really curated (you would be amazed at how many messages just include an error trace with no context) and the only way to ask things to real spark devs being to submitt a jira ticket.  I know there are TONS of articles of people showing you how to do a wordcount in spark. That is not really spark.  If you really want to get into spark, I would recommend getting the [spark certification](http://www.oreilly.com/data/sparkcert)?  I really liked [this](https://www.gitbook.com/book/jaceklaskowski/mastering-apache-spark/details) , i read the previous version, I think this version has updated api changes.  Source: Deployed and use spark clusters multiple times. Fighting with my cluster as we speak.#> My work right now does not deal with big data, but I figure it's a must-know for the general industry.  I wouldn't say it is a must.#Maybe learning Data Science would be a good start or what you want: https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go/blob/master/README.md . Basically it sounds like you want to analyze big data. #> Anyone know of a brief book or perhaps a series of posts on a blog that can get me from noob-status to being confident with 50GB of data for ETL?

I'm quite convinced it's the self-driving cars that have people mistakenly confused about AI being such a big deal. What people lose sight of is that cars are highly artificial and largely automated from day one. A self-driving car is not intelligent, it is simply responding to input in an artificial man-made environment with clear and specific rules in a quite mechanical way. It's not intelligence, it's simply better sensors which allow basic boolean logic to follow pre-established rules.   Yeah sure there are programs that can teach themselves how to perform succesfully according to pre-existing rules through repetitive iterations. Neural networks are indeed based on biological systems but the hype over what they can achieve has been running at the high water mark for some time now. Such algorithms are far from a general intelligence of an insect such as a mosquito. Mosquitoes are amazingly intelligent compared to billion dollar neural networks.    There isn't a general trend towards believing false messages today that is any stronger than it was in the past. If you go back to the 80s, the use of focus groups to divide the voters into blocks that could be targeted with specific language to elicit the correct responses was being done back when desktop calculators were more common than PCs.   The basic fact is not that Trump has significant support at all or that there is a global tilt to the right. Hardly, it's quite the opposite. Notice California just legalized marijuana as well as the first state on the East Coast. Seems to have been forgotten in the hysteria over Trump. Rather, the basic fact is that left leaning voters who were registered as Democrats voted for and expected Bernie Sanders to be the Democratic nominee and when they felt robbed by the party insiders they walked away and said --fuck it, this game is rigged.   Trying to spin that into Trump is taking over the world with the help of his pocket calculator is a false narrative. #Seems like the tone of the article is that This is a billionare who *funds the party that isn't mine*, which is bad.  If he were funding my party, this wouldn't be a story.   I mean, really:  >This is a billionaire who is, as billionaires are wont, trying to reshape the world according to his personal beliefs.  Is there anyone who *doesn't* try to 'reshape the world according to his personal beliefs'?   It would be one thing if all billionaries had the same political opinion, but in reality they seem to be spread according to the same distribution as everyone else.

All the information is sourced and we'll documented in Kerr's stores of articles at www.thecitizensaudit.com add well as other sources available on the Internet.  Andrew Kerr is an Investigative Reporter with a background in Information Technology working with Big Data that has uncovered evidence that David Brock is guilty of embezzling from his own 501C3 through fraudulent payments to his own organizations. Additionally he alleges that Brock violated Federal campaign Finance LawsKerr alleges, with documents available through public record research, Brock then charging fees to the organization to do what are essentially paper work transfers between organizations he owns/manages, essentially embezzling the funds and had not declared the income on his tax returns. ###The 14 Pro-Clinton Organizations that Share Office Spacehttp://www.thecitizensaudit.com/2016/09/12/pro-clinton-organizations-share-office-space/>Last week, The Citizens Audit exposed how the Clinton Campaign Illegally Purchased “Research” from pro-Democrat Super PAC, and how Media Matters for America is Filing Fraudulent Tax Returns by hiding rental income.>This week, we plan to expose even more.

The public documents and Income Tax Filings support his position. Several irregularities also exist within publicly recorded Filing documents required for the operation of his 14 501C3 PACs that indicate Brock illegally collided with the Clinton campaign and provided deficiency support well beyond the legal limits. Once a PAC works in collusion with a campaign they are restricted in the amount they can contribute to a candidate and it is a Federal Crime to violate these limits. ###17 Counts of Illegal Coordination Exposed: Pro-Clinton Super PAC Implicatedhttp://www.thecitizensaudit.com/2016/10/24/17-counts-of-illegal-coordination-exposed-pro-clinton-super-pac-implicated/###Super PAC Coordination: An Explainer Part 2http://www.thecitizensaudit.com/2016/10/19/super-pac-coordination-an-explainer-part-2/r/CoincidenceTheorist-23-;"anti-corruption does not = pro-trump. fuck david brock!#And now we know why CTR no longer exists as this entity.

Yes, because the company that owns the building is called ""Square 516**S** Office Venture LLC"" which is a subsidiary of Vornado Realty Trust, a major commercial real estate company.  And they are sending the rent checks to 2101 L Street NW STE 700, which is occupied by Cushman & Wakefield, the law firm that works as a broker for Vornado Realty Trust.  Somehow this is evidence that David Brock is stealing all the rent money from the landlord, I guess?  Kerr doesnt really say, he just tells us that this ""doesnt look good"".  His other articles are much of the same.  Someone who doesnt understand what he is doing is painstakingly sifting through public records, finding typos, and then trying to spin them into conspiracy theories.  I explained this error and some of his other errors to him months ago, but he told me that 10,000 people are signed up to his newsletter so apparently he is just interested in peddling fake news in exchange for clicks.#So if I take the effort to prove you wrong will you pin a public apology at the top of DNC leaks for a week and remove my ban.

datascience;5x53qi;1488480667.0;/r/datascience/comments/5x53qi/how_common_is_python_compared_to_r_in_data/;How common is Python compared to R in Data Science in the corporate world?;My experience with data science is strictly from an acedemic standpoint. To that end there is a lot of SAS Stata and some R sprinkled in (my undergraduate course was taught in R, but it seems rare in the actual post-graduate community).In terms of corporate/private sector/Big Data/etc world though, how common are Python and R? What languages are the big players? I cant see a firm like Google or IBM using SAS or Stata;"Python and Java.  In commercial environments, you will be doing more software and the needs to connect to other systems, ingest and fix data, often in streams and not loaded into memory.  Those tasks are more common than in academia.   Python is better at this than R.   SAS (and of course Excel) is very common in old-school financial industries (banks/insurance), and very rare in silicon-valley type technology environments.  IBM owns SPSS.  In technology there is some use of R, but python is preferred. Stata is a near zero.  Government labs and engineering can have MATLAB. #You build the models in R, productionize in Python. Of course, this is not always true, but it is one relatively common approach. That is to say, each language has its own strengths and its weaknesses, and as tools they are not mutually exclusive. Depending on the task and the stage of the work, and obviously the company, the languages used may differ and intertwine.#Python is more general purpose and thus better suited to be integrated in a larger project, however R has a larger community of people implementing every single new algorithm or model that makes it to a peer-reviewed journal.   At my company we use both R and Python depending on the project. However for real-time systems or complex production data pipelines we use other languages and frameworks (e.g. Scala + Spark).#In the company I work for we normally use Python for production. I typically explore / prototype using R, then move to R for production; other coworkers go with Python directly, but I like my way so I don't lose touch with R.  Also, heavy amounts of Java (like for coding HIVE's UDFs/UDAFs.)#It depends a lot on what your role is. Data science is unfortunately not something that defines easily as one predefined skill set, familiarities with one set of tech stacks, or use of one set of languages or another. Data science is a catch-all meant to describe something I think will further specialize over time. It's happening right now with ""data engineering"" vs ""data science"".  Data scientists are scientists but with the ability to use modern computational hardware, and sensor data. That's it. Their background can be as diverse the catch-all ""Scientist"". There are psychologists, physicists, chemists, biologists, and hundreds more. It's the same in data science.  Some data scientists are responsible for making production software as well as the analysis / model building part, so they'd likely use Python at times for both. That's me (sort of) however we have a lot of production work all over the place in terms of languages or stacks so I just use what connects easily with everything for my analyses even if I have to code in PHP at times.  Some data scientists are more likely spending their time building models and exploring data before handing it off to an engineering team and working more as a product manager for their piece at that point (I wish that was me). Those people might use R because frankly it's easier than Python for scientific research in many ways. It just has so much more stuff available and a long history for being used in research and charting, etc.  Then it also depends on the data scientist's background, company size, company production stacks (i.e. for web or analytics or whatever the team they're on does).  So long story short, it's really hard to say. For a gross simplification I'd go with :   1) Python is used by traditional engineering groups  2) R is used by traditionally scientific groups  Companies are, after all, a collection of people so their backgrounds will collectively influence what they use, at least early on. It's slower moving for bigger companies and it's more likely a new hire has to adapt to what they are using (so based on history) rather than the other way around.  Then of course what a data scientist personally uses for their own research is totally up to them. If it's just digging in to a problem and you don't have to share it with a larger organization then it doesn't really matter what you use. Whatever works works.#Far from an expert here, but we use R.  We looked into Python, but it seems R is steadily becoming more and more prevalent....existing programs (especially microsoft programs) are beginning to incorporate the ability to use or connect with R.  #I'm going to disagree with most people here and say that it really doesn't matter. I am yet to come across any good companies who say anything other than, ""We don't really care what you use, we just want you to do your job"". I know data scientists who use excel as well. Mainly because you can churn out 10 graphs in excel for a presentation in 5 seconds versus having to remember how to use ggplot or seaborn. Just my .02#I routinely use both.#Since Python and R are free most companies use those.  Of course Excel is still widely used. SAS is mostly in banking and pharmaceuticals areas.#Data scientists at Google primarily use R. For production models, the actual R code will be called by a C++ or Java pipeline, but those pipelines tend to be written by software engineers rather than data scientists.  For ad hoc analysis, though, plenty of Googlers use iPython-like notebooks.#Python for scripting. R for models. #We mostly use Python and Java. JavaScript for web stuff (viz mostly). "

What are your future plans for your career with respect to data eng/""big data""? ";"1. Made my interest in data known at my first job out of UG (2 years ago) and got put on a big data team working with Hadoop, etc. Then applied to explicitly data engineer roles and landed one at a startup, my current job. 2. If you're in UG, just have the right skills and interest in data. If out of UG, same and maybe also try to work on projects involving (big) data. It's a pretty easy transition ime. 3. It really depends on the specific position since 'data engineer' is still a new title and the specific role can range from glorified DBA to data scientist who can code and knows DS&A. But generally, skills-wise: Java/Python, (no)SQL, and some level of familiarity with some of: DB design, modeling, and administration, the Hadoop ecosystem, data cleaning, maybe a little stats and/or ""ML"" knowledge, distributed systems / system design, ~the cloud~ (I find a lot of roles are looking for experience with AWS and the like). 4. Building out data ingestion pipelines, developing a data warehouse, ad hoc queries and data analysis, SQL scripts.  5. I want to move into the ML space as much as possible and maybe even set up a move into data science. Distributed systems work is neat too. Possibly considering going back to school.  Definitely not an authority here, so if you're interested, I'd recommend checking out:   * https://www.stitchdata.com/resources/reports/the-state-of-data-engineering/ * https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-rise-of-the-data-engineer-91be18f1e603#.htgidsfgn#[deleted]#1) Was able to use Spark pretty well.   2) Learn Spark, Parallelism, underlying data pipeline technologies  3) newest developments, people are pushing new tech all the time  4) Pretty similar to a normal SWE  5) I don't think much about it. I have a skill that I'm good at that people pay for. #Honestly, most data engineer jobs aren't really difficult, and companies have no problems hiring new people or new grads. So its a bit of a double edged sword in that you're not exactly going to be learning a ton of new stuff.  So just apply away.  Typical day is run queries across data, move it somewhere else. Repeat. Obviously some jobs have very interesting challenges, but kinda few and far between.  Future plans? Find something more challenging. Pretty much all Big Data engineers are doing the same.#I just started a new job at a startup that's a data platform. I am their second engineer and the platform needs to scale better(currently using a relational database to store data), hence there are a lot of opportunities. You'll find it easier to break into a sub-field like this by working at a young startup that needs a jack of all trade and can self learn.  In terms of what's important to learn i'd start with checking out the Hadoop ecosystem and Apache related technologies.  https://hadoopecosystemtable.github.io/#1. I started a club at my university that organized conferences. In order to fund these conferences, we needed corporate sponsors. Our university put us in touch with a few and I cold called some others. In the process, I ended up impressing some executives with some of the models/visualizations I was using for our pitch and ended with an internship with them. That eventually led to a 2 year stint at a large private equity firm. The connections that I made at the firm were very valuable and it allowed me to parlay that into numerous tech interviews and an eventual position at a large tech company.   2. I don't want to be redundant so I won't talk about projects/stacks. I think being knowledgeable about mathematics and statistics is helpful especially if you want to do the cool stuff, otherwise you'll just be doing SQL scripting all damn day. You don't necessarily need to be a statistics phd but you should at the very least understand the fundamentals of ML & data mining, statistical & predictive analysis, best practices (i.e CRISP DM, RCA etc) and so forth. For example, you should have an intuitive idea why your implementations improve an algorithm/model. You should also know how to test your hypothesis out. My background is in mathematical statistics so I did this but for CS concepts.  3. The theory and implementation is still in its infancy. What is standard practice now, may not be standard practice in a few years. Just consider the fact that the Alexnet paper, which led to the explosion of deep learning, came out in 2012.The most important thing is to have the mathematical literacy to keep up as well as the mathematical/statistical foundation to fall back on when need be. Obviously, this won't apply if you're basically a DBA but was given a ""data scientist"" or ""data engineer"" title but OP seemed like he wanted to know about the cool stuff.    4. I spend the majority of my time managing the database, preparing and normalizing data and collaborating with engineers and product managers who either have an overzealous romanticization of data science or think it is a fad and don't understand the value you bring. A smaller portion of my time is spent on implementing, testing and retesting the algorithm. Then the rest is generally reading papers, fiddling around with new ideas and making data visualizations because for some reason everyone with a MBA is addicted to this shit.  #If you already have a job, there are applications for it everywhere. Aside from finding a job doing that, it might be possible to turn your current job into that. I'm spending some of my time now working on ML stuff with Spark that we can use in our product, but I really regret getting involved with it because we started doing ""agile"" and it's hard to give a good daily status report when starting to work on something you don't have a lot of experience with. #I have a question for data engineers. Are data engineers in really high demand? Is it easy to go to any company when you're a data engineer?"

Backstory inside;[deleted];"First, congrats on getting to the point where you can make this choice!  I'm sure you know how amazing that is, but here are some more congratulations from an internet stranger :)  So you already know the roadblocks, but I'm going to steer you towards getting the degree.  If you want to have any hope of working outside of MX, you're going to need it.  But it can also be the catalyst you need to make international contacts in the first place.  Make sure you focus on international studies, and also see if they have a study abroad program.  Your English seems perfectly fine, so language is not a barrier for you.    Probably the easiest way to get an international assignment is to get a job with a local company that's headquartered in another country.  It may take a few years of busting your ass to get to the point where you can ask for an international assignment, but you don't seem to be a stranger to hard work.  Very best of luck to you!#I would say go back to school and work on your certs during enrollment. Going to school doesn't necessarily get you a job however it will open doors a little more in order to get the interviews.   I have been in the IT field for about 3 years now and I graduated when I was 27 so no I don't think 27 is too old to get started in the field.   As far as your current job I would assume if you use the same name it could be found with a Google search. It my be against the law to discriminate for your previous jobs, but will never be able to prove that's what's happening so hopefully you use a different name in your current position. #Should you go back to college for your degree (And that is what I would highly recommend so you can relocate to a country that will pay you fairly, and even if you didn't need a degree to relocate I'd still recommend it) you won't be too old to make your break into IT.  Myself, I took a few years off of college and didn't graduate until I turned 29 (almost 30) and since then I've had a very successful professional IT career.   #34, male, US here. Facing a similar choice. I had the opportunity to go to school when I was younger, had an athletic scholarship right out of high school. Then 9/11 happened, and a lot of my friends were enlisting and deploying, so I dropped out and followed. I've been out of the military about 8 years now, and I've made my own way into IT. Used my savings to live on while I worked for cheap for a MSP in the town I was living in. Did that for a year and shopped myself out for other work. I've bounced around the US, and have landed in the DC area, with a great job and pretty good pay...  Part of me wants to go back to school to finish, but a bigger part of me doesn't want to spend the money. I've got my foot in the door already, and I feel like all a degree would do at this point is get me a pat on the back... In other words, it would be far less of an improvement to my resume than several certifications would. So, I've got some basic certs, and I'm looking to focus on some other things, and am studying for those now. Hoping to be in a new role this time next year.  Bottom line, if you have NO experience in the field AND you have the money (DO NOT TAKE OUT A LOAN!), go to school. This will open a lot of doors for you. I've run into some situations where having a degree would have given me some other options (especially for government work). With school, you'll have the opportunity to meet people and begin laying the groundwork for your professional network.#I think that if you can go back to college without going into debt, and your credits transfer.... then this is the best option, followed by certs (in your senior year, and after you graduate).  You'll be able to fall back on the degree for the next 10-20 years, whereas the certs alone only get you into the field initially.  There are some definite trade-offs with this, especially in that the job market may change by the time you graduate, and that schools aren't always offering classes which are current to what the market actually needs.    It's also worth noting that certs alone won't necessarily get you into the job, it's the educating yourself in order get the certs which can help you get the job; and even then, some employers won't accept what they'd consider ""non-professional"" experience in lieu of a degree.  (Many do, yes, but not all.)    As another poster mentioned, a degree is much higher respected than certs alone - when you have little or no professional experience.  If you had 5-8 years professional experience, then I might have a different answer.#I would recommend getting the certs now and then formulate a plan to pay for college. You really don't want to take on debt to pay for school. A lot of universities offer free tuition to employees. Some employers also offer tuition reimbursement for degrees related to your job. It may take you longer to complete a degree while working full time, but in the long run your will come out ahead financially. #I don't have advice better than what's already been given, but I just wanted to wish you the best of luck! #Check out the Netherlands for study and work, there's a huge demand for IT professionals here.  As for a degree, if you have the money and motivation got for it - but don't be fooled into thinking it's the only option. Many people work in IT with a rubbish _traditional_ academic background, but have proven to be good self-learners (which is essential in this industry)  Good luck!#hello. i find your story to be very moving. i was in the same situation (very hard up but kept pushing to be in a better place) and thru self study i got to be in IT. i am working now as a system administrator and earn 7x the normal wages in my country.   i think i get hired not because i have a degree but because of all the things i know how to even when i don't have one.   it doesn't make me less smart than co workers that have a degree.   my advise is option 2 - self study. the world is changing and in IT it is changing very fast.   you will spend maybe the 1-2 years at first working on grunt work stuff then it gets better. you will have to keep studying while working so you get education + practical experience. so once you have basic skills secure that job that can give you experience even if it's low paying for a year then move on.   look into MOOCs like coursera and udacity.   first study the cloud (devops, get AWS certified, learn windows, scripting) then pursue IT security which is very promising now. learn how to code.   we live in a very globalized world now and most companies pay for people that can resolve complex problems and a CS degree doesn't guarantee that for them.   you've already taken the difficult path, keep going at it.   most people went to college because they led very sheltered lives but being self taught is ultimately better.   edit: also IT work is more than just the money you get paid doing it. it is very challenging and meaningful work. everyone cares about the money but once you become very good at it money will come later. if you want to work overseas don't forget to focus on IT security as its very in demand. #Short answer.  Get some certs and get into a job. I am seeing lots of demand right now...who knows in a few years if t will remain.   Explore college once you get more experience with sub-field you enjoy. Lots of places of tuition reimbursement too, and since you dont have kids i could see you having some nights free to get degree.   #If you have a US residence or family living in the US, use their address to go to school online.  WGU would be a great cheap option.  I'm sorry you have to make a living in the adult industry to survive.  I once dated a nurse that was a stripper for years to pay for school (I know, cliche), but that never impeded her in her professional career, even in a small town.  You don't need to put that history in your resume - only pertinent information."

singularity;5xnemj;1488729296.0;/r/singularity/comments/5xnemj/the_internet_waking_up_as_a_collective/;"""The Internet waking up as a collective consciousness"" hypothesis: a few questions";[removed];"I'm a systems engineer for a cloud infrastructure company. I'll tell you right now that the chances of the *network itself* ""waking up"" and somehow taking control are very very low, but the chances that the network will be *involved* approach 100% regardless of the eventual path to AGI.  Consider corporations as an example of low-fidelity emergent intelligence generated by an evolutionary algorithm. Since they don't have a perfect or high-definition model of themselves (like an AI without access to its own source code) they don't tend to exhibit the particular runaway behaviors that are the subject of this subreddit, although there are analogues of the agent alignment problem (the utility function of a corporation is stockholder value.)  Internet infrastructure follows simple rules which result in large, complicated networks exhibiting certain well-defined behaviors (e.g. the standards defined by the RFCs released by the IETF.) It is unlikely that a construct resembling intelligence would arise from these networks doing their jobs.  However, the Internet itself provides access to an enormous amount of information as well as a simple means to coordinate any devices, anywhere on the planet. This allows for things like botnets. A virus spreads from device to device, installing software to communicate with the rest of the swarm and running whatever commands its puppetmaster decides. Something like a botnet--maybe a modified or corrupted military cyberweapon -- could present a real danger of runaway effects.#I think it's just that nobody knows how the brain produces consciousness, just that it's a large complex system.  So maybe other complex systems will 'wake up' too.  I don't think anybody has a good idea about this process or even what consciousness is even.  All we really know is that turning off the brain turns off consciousness too.  Consciousness is one of the biggest mysteries in science.#It's like being able to peer in to a collective consciousness, but I don't think anybody has theorized that the internet itself will become conscious on its own. Once we have AGI it will probably seek out all of humanity's information, including the entirety of the internet, so the AGI by that point will have in essence become a collective consciousness.#To me, ""The Internet"" is more of an abstract concept or industry term.  A conscious AI would certainly *use* the internet as a primary source of information, or the components that make up the AI could all be contained *within* the internet in some fashion, which might be closer to what you mean.  The blockchain technology [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) has touched on some of the ideas of ""code"" (living contracts) running on a public blockchain, essentially running *within* the internet, instead of in a centralized fashion.  These kinds of public and potentially unstoppable processes (cryptocurrencies and other blockchain technologies) leave an open door to an AI off its leash, a botnet on steroids, computing collectively in hivemind fashion.#You are describing the plot of Neuromancer by William Gibson. #Like other posters have said, I doubt the internet itself will become aware, but if a GAI does come into existence in a lab somewhere it's likely to permeate it rather quickly.  Like if an ant queen found an empty colony of billions of tunnels.#Reminded me of the joke that says librarians are just a library's way of making more libraries. In the distant past, humans didn't have books, but relied on oral history to preserve the things they learned. Eventually books were invented and became a vital part of human survival - they formed a ""symbiotic"" relationship with humans - books would teach humans better ways to survive, in return, humans would replicate those books. Now the internet is playing a similar role - a collective consciousness already exists, but at the moment, it requires both the internet and humanity to exist. If the either were destroyed, the other would suffer a great injury. Maybe humanity would always be around in one form or another - maybe as a lowly appendix that our robot overlords barely pay attention to.#One might argue that the Internet is already a brain on a large macroscope. It has memory (storage), emotions (twitter), neocortex (reddit and google), neurotransmitters (cryptocurrency). Does it have consciousness or a will? Kevin Kelly argues that technology has a will and is the 7th kingdom of life. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Technology_Wants#Collective beliving anything they are fed on the internet "

It's positively ridiculous that there are people in America that believe a health care system which exists in fifty eight countries and has been in place in some form or another for 130 years or in its current form for 70 years will 'destroy' the economy and make health care fail. It's also pretty sick that there are a lot of people who believe someone with more money deserves to have a better quality of health care. Anyway if we stop running away from the future (or I guess in this case the freaking past) this point won't be a problem.  >The USA have decided to severely limit visas to Colombians, which means that while Carlos would have been a very successful researcher at Berkeley, the USA do not grant him the right to live and work in the country despite his not having anything to do with drug trafficking. This of course kills his dream of living a fulfilling and successful life.  This sadly already exists. We provide only 140,000 LPR visas for employment-based immigration in the US per year and no more than 7% of the total granted (not the total possible to be granted) can come from any one country. This means that if we were to give out all the LPR employment visas we could the maximum to any one country is 9.8k, which is severely limited. We do also have unofficial limits to countries based on factors like you've described. For a nation of immigrants we are very non-immigrant friendly.   >Unfortunately, the housing market is very competitive and landlords are discouraged from letting their houses to Middle Eastern people since they are statistically more likely to be intolerant Muslims or involved in terrorist activities. Ali will in all likelihood not live in a nice area, but be placed in a quarter where mostly low-income Asian people live and drug trade is a viable source of money  This has been the case in the US since the very start of the country. Every wave of immigration came with very impoverished collectives of people from that country living in towns. Even after the end of slavery and up through this very day black Americans live this reality. This problem is not new.   Not that I'm acting in defence of liberalism, but merely 2/3 of these problems already exist and have for a very long time and the first will hopefully be avoided.   #You sort of shift your definition of big data when it suits your example.  For your example 3, if big data is as advanced as it is in your first example, it's not racial discrimination any more because the decision wouldn't just be ""he's Iraqi"" it'd be ""nobody in his circle of friends is a confirmed member of ISIS, and we have to go 3 degrees away before we find one. His social media also shows pictures of him wearing a MAGA hat and watching Football. He's probably not a terrorist."" You'd be able to look at things which are a better indicator of the person being radical than just his race. The more advanced big data gets, the less strictly racial discrimination will happen.  For your second example, people that are highly employable have always been given preferential treatment in immigration. That really doesn't have anything to do with big data, and big data will again be more likely to deduce the earning potential of a person than just where they came from.  So now we're back to your example 1, which I think is your strongest. That being said, you start with assumptions that undermine the value of individual liberty. Both Bob and Alice are required to have health insurance in your scenario. That's a government mandate constriction on their disposable income. Imagine a scenario where Bob is able to map his genetic markers and see his potential for various diseases and instead of paying insurance, have a health savings account that he pays into at a rate proportional to the expected cost of treatment. Big data actually helps here. And typical proponents of individual liberty usually don't advocate for forced equal distribution of wealth.  So what I'm getting at is that big data isn't intrinsically opposed to individual liberty, but people's desire to manage other people's lives definitely does seem to grow when they believe they have better information.  #In the event that this does happen what would replace individualism/liberalism? Would it be some sort of odd collectivism where people are all the same more or less? That wouldn't be good for our society or economy.   Thus I think Example 2 brings up a good point. It demonstrates that in some ways big data would actually be detrimental to the economy. Companies are going to go bust if they don't hire the best people and rely on the notion of groups. I think individualism will quite possibly increase. People will start to reject the notion of ""groups"" because it's not particularly viable in some cases. We'll start treating people MORE like individuals rather than less.#With the addition of more data, I'd hope that it would *reduce* the types of discrimination you've described. Let's go through your examples.  Example 1: Alice has a ""healthier genome"" but Bob exercises more . You think that will automatically make Bob pay more, I think the better statistics will give a better estimate of their life expectancy. Why do you think the statistics will just ignore lifestyle? It's pretty much expected that both genetic bias and lifestyle are important, why would we suddenly forget about one when we know more about the other?  Example 2: As people have said, this is already an issue. In fact the situation you described is the one that's already happening. But with better predictive models, we can say ""even though the average Colombian is more likely to be involved with drug trafficking, researchers generally don't""  Example 3: Basically the same idea as example 2.  You seem to think with the addition of more statistics, we'll somehow apply them more broadly. Which is what you would do *if you were lacking in statistics*. We currently have massive profiling issues because our statistics suck, so we can only apply broad strokes.  As you say "" a single statistic doesn't say anything about any given individual."". That's precisely the point. Right now, we only have access to a few statistics so that's what we're doing *now*.  But in the age of big data, it won't be a ""single statistic"", it will be a multitude. And obviously even all those statistics won't tell you everything about a person. But they sure as hell will lead to less broad profiling than we currently have.#We've seen technological innnovations in the directions you cite already (ability to profile, insurers discriminating for profit) and society tends to backlash at each of them. Look at the controversies over both racial profiling and health insurance.  Why do you believe individuals will acquiesce to future statistical advances and change their world views instead of resisting them as in the past?#Example 1 doesn't seem to have anything to do with individual liberalism but rather whether healthcare should be more expensive for less healthy people.   Example 2 and 3 don't seem much different than reality now, and how this plays out will depend largely on the success or failure of certain political movements, the continuation or cessation of certain trends. I think the alt-right will fail, and I think people are already regretting both Brexit and Trump.  The thing you're assuming that I don't believe you're right about, is that we'll just end up being okay with statistics justifying unconstitutional treatment of individuals, or the repeal/amendment of laws that protect individuals from this. At least in the US, people still don't take kindly to that sort of thing. It's one thing to try it against immigrant groups in a politically tense time for immigration concerns, another thing to actually repeal the laws which protect immigrants who are already citizens from it - since that also means making the majority population subject to the same sorts of treatment. The slippery slope argument will come out quick.#>Example 1: Ten years later, whole-genome sequencing has become incredibly cheap and we know a lot more about the genomic code. Health insurers will demand their customers to perform a genetic check-up, and after assessing the risk of certain diseases, adjust their rates so that people prone to certain genetically affected diseases will have to pay more money to be covered to the same degree as average Joe or Jane, practically from birth.  Is this not exactly the opposite of your claim? The company is treating them as an individual and charging them on their own merit.#Individual liberalism was always untenable, so I doubt your premise. All societies that excel have a very complex, in-depth, and top-down legal and tax structure, and cities that excel within those countries have a very complex, in-depth, and top-down zoning, building coding, city planning, and public transporting structure.  Individual liberalism is a romantic notion that we have to feel better about the fact that human instinct and individual profit motive often do not serve the public good.  This is not to discount the positive effects of being happy, of course, there are benefits to making people feel they have agency because they follow existing laws."

Get out as soon as you can. It doesn't get better (there, at least).  I picked up some bad habits while there that I'm still having to train myself out of. Did do my best on the side to keep my skills relevant / not let them atrophy and it seems to have worked out (have a few Big N onsites etc. coming up).  Message me if you want to chat more.#Keep your head up, I know just how you feel. Did somebody say rant time!?  I graduated in summer 2015 and freelanced for 6 month before getting my current job about a year ago. As I always wanted to work in gamedev, my CS master's had a large portion of game tech and related classes, which ended up severely limiting my job options around here ( Berlin ).   So obviously I'm super excited to be invited to this startup game studio, but I'm careful about professionalism with these types of companies. So I have an interview with the boss and the lead dev and they are both nice people, I get asked about depency injection and similar things and do alright. A few days later they offer me a job and I take it.  In the following months they explain to me that our app:  Needs to be released in the next 3 months when we just hired me and 2 more new devs, and the exisiting 2 devs had just setup up the most basic gameplay.  That during training phase ( 3 months ) our pay would be half of the initially planned 3,5k, as this was an option in the contract if the need would arise. I had been told this would not be the case and I couldn't really fight them on this.  A few months later a large publishing deal had mystically disappeared and wouldn't bring in any money. The boss offered to keep us on for half pay or let us go. During this time I started looking for a new job on the side, but I had not really gathered anything to improve my portfolio.   Then in the last few months of 2016, development culture totally dropped. All features were roughly sketched on whiteboard, needed to be completed within a week and were basically published untested. We had some thousand users and every day there would be reports of uncompleted inapp purchases, crashes on startup and 0% playability on low performance devices.   I am now, a year later, finally in a position to have other options open up to me, after convincing myself it wouldn't be a defeat to completely leave the game development industry and instead go towards data visualization / 3D programming jobs. But still to this day we (devs) have to take blame by our increasingly delusional boss about technical difficulties destroying this ""huge business opportunity"" we had at our hands....  Also we work in a large circle of 8 desks and nobody gets any privacy and it's loud. I fucking hate it so much.   End rant. #Few things:  1. You are actually learning a ton.

We had a kid like that in one of my first positions - fresh out of just an AA at the local community college, but a ton of initiative, he became the ""tools and processes"" guy, added a bunch of neat features to make the way we code better, and wound up jumping from an Associate to a Lead in literally 3 years.   3. It sounds like your scrum master is overwhelmed (as a SM myself, I really don't like the idea of having SMs spread out over many teams). Take the reins! Ask him if you can help him out with your team to take care of some of the busy work / filter him information so he can focus on his other teams. This also gives you the ability to prune your backlog and rein in your rogue QA guy.   That's how you turn this kinda-shit position into an amazing resume builder.#Just curious, did you have competing offers?  What was your thought process to choose this place of work?#Sounds pretty typical of an older/larger company (with lots of legacy applications/procedures).#I knew Fidelity was bad news the second the recruiter told me about the classroom training in bumfuck North Carolina. Not only that, but they expected me to go to Dallas for the onsite interview on my own dime. Reason being ""You live in Texas, it's not that bad of a drive anyway.""  Noped the fuck out of there after the initial phone call.#If it makes you feel any better (graduated spring '16):  I got let go from my internship as a QA Tester and needed another job. Got hired on at a small IT consulting firm. No technical interview, got hired on the spot. My first task was to make changes to a poorly documented Fortan program to ""modernize"" it for a client (last save date was older than I was by like 3 years).   Then it was pretty much web-dev using a boring cookie cutter CMS, and other web apps where things were rigged to ""just work"". Poor documentation in source control, shit like passing in 30 session variables through post instead of using SQL, removing Yahoo toolbars, etc.  I liked how casual everything was, but now I'm super worried that I've regressed past any semblance of professionalism. You sound like you are in the same situation I'm in. Just study your ass off at home (getting my Sec+) so you can jump ship when you get fed up with it.#Your situation is normal for bank of youknowwho. You would be much happier at a smaller company OR poissbly a large company but in a department that does all its own IT.  You should just stay there until you can find a different job. You dont reveal at interviews how dysfuctional your current employer is, just tell them you are seeking better employment or wish to relocate to a better area.   That company you work at should not even exist. They were cobbled together in a shotgun wedding in 2008 from three other companies and the only reason they exist is because of monopoly power and special treatment from federal reserve. I'm only mentioning this issue because other companies cannot get away with wasting resources like they can, and this is not normal.  I have a crazy story from there, they hired a whole team of 20 people once, who then started and got computers setup, but the project was delayed due to politics/budget and they sat with zero work for 6 months, had them researching best pracises and shit (useless makework) and then the project was cancelled and they let them go. Basically you are getting a feel for what government jobs are like.   It could be worse, tight deadlines and high stress, working on sunday - this is life at an investment bank and lots of other places.  What you should do is figure out what your core stack is, and work on side projects at work or home to hone skill. When interviewing you need to be able to pass a technical interview for that stack. You can always fudge and exagerate your role on what you did at current job.  Really this is a great opportunity you have to line up better paying 'dream job' with your desired tech stack. I would like to change to ios but its hard.#[deleted]"
Accounting;5vc1y0;1487690751.0;/r/Accounting/comments/5vc1y0/career_switch_advice/;Career Switch Advice;Hello my fellow accountants,   I have been hesitant to post this question because I think I know the answer but I have been in this community for awhile giving advice and taking advice so I thought it's probably the best place to ask. I can no longer stand the accounting career path I have taken and need to find my new path. Am I crazy?Alright so here is a bit about me (This is a throwaway to avoid linking it to my other one)* Graduated with a bachelor's in Accounting from a well-respected school * Worked for government my junior/senior year and 1 year after as a budget/project analyst * Decided to avoid the CPA exam (Didn't enjoy the Big 4 lifestyle) got my CMA and began working for a manufacturing company as a cost accountant* Began working as an FP&A analyst on the side for a non-profit (unpaid)* Wanted to live near a city and moved into a new cost accountant role in another industry and found myself doing the same work for slightly more pay, but with less to do.All in all, I have about 5-6 years of solid cost accounting experience and various FP&A work for a charity. However, I am not happy in this type of role and I am not really sure where to look to do the type of work I am both good at and an enjoy.The best parts of my day are when people ask real questions about numbers, forcing me to pull in big data, create cost models or dashboards in excel. In my current role, I have automated most of my work in VBA that I feel like I am a glorified data analyst with some accounting knowledge. So my real question is where do I go from here? What role can I move to that will let me use my excel, SQL, VBA, data warehouse skills to actually help out besides just making a pre-defined role more automated. I know a lot of people here are in busy season and will shun me for saying it but my job is boring and too easy. There is no challenge, we work 60 hours a week but most of it is me just being here so I am here not real work.In my mind, the roles I can move to are in the IT world now: Business Intelligence, Business Analyst...etc. However I haven't quite figured out how to open those doors and whether they will really be what challenges me to feel like my job is a job and not just sitting at a desk waiting.Any advice is greatly appreciated and I apologize for the wall of text so here is a TL DR-**Worked as a cost analyst/accountant for 5+ years, want to find a role that challenges my analytical side more.**;BI or BA roles aren't IT oriented in every manifestation. If that interests you go for it.  I would avoid the IT oriented ones where you become s project manager or report monkey for other departments.#Sounds like you would like business analytics, and as far as I know each of the Big 4 are building out their capabilty in that area.  I, also, would have suggested using a recruiter but you dont seem to fond of that idea. Other than that you could go the route of employee referrals which are generally processed faster than random applications. If you want, you can inbox me and we can talk the possibility of putting in a referral at my firm.

My work/life balance is very important to me !!  also i am a average student/learner my gpa is 2.8..  I realize i dont really like accounting...there is no goal at all and i dont feel usefull at all... its like veryfing the work of someone else and msot of the time its already good and you jstu verified it for nothing... you could have had done nothing and it wouldnt had change the results...and i really like computers in general and i am curious and want to learn SQL, database, Excel, VBA and work with them !! the only time i like my day at work is when i create a new spreadsheet or when someone ask me to help them with a hard index/match or pivot table...  but is there any entry level position into those role?!  what does the day of a cost accountant look like?!  #remindme! 2 days#how old are you?!  are those role open to someone with 2.8 GPA?! with no CPA?! and no experience?!#You're right, you know the answer.  >I haven't quite figured out how to open those doors   Use a recruiter.#[deleted]

However, I'm not sure what technology to go with as there are so many to choose from and I am not that wise to see what would be future proof. From what I have researched, people are jumping into Big data and starting to learn HIVE, Hbase so that they dont have to jump into Java for hadoop . I'm still confused tho if this would be a right approach to start learning Big data technology.Any help would be appreciated.Thanks;If you want to stay in the SQL Server world and expand your knowledge I would suggest looking at R/PolyBase in SQL Server 2016.  Even though R is slow is does let you query structured and unstructured data.  And don't forget trying to add some experience with Azure and Azure Data Warehouse.  And do you do any Power BI development?  Edit: spelling#I don't know if you are familiar with this podcast. The host interviewed the CTO of Microsoft about the future of data management.... I don't have any answers, but you might find this enlightening: https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2017/big-data-tools-and-trends#How much business acumen do you have?#SQL developer you say? Maybe one of the humanities. Jokes.   Big data is not going away. You can train with learning data sets and a few VM's. HIVE seems to have a future though. Several universities are teaching it now. I would begin by just following tutorials on the HIVE site for setting up a small cluster of VM's. Then understand the director and clusters, then move on to one of the books that come recommended on a site like amazon.#SQL Server has added a lot of big data support recently. If you aren't already, get familiar with columnstore indexes. These will give you the functionality of HBase, but in an ecosystem you're already familiar with. http://www.nikoport.com/columnstore/ is the best resource I've seen on them. I'd also learn R as someone else suggested. I haven't seen it in action, but being able to do advanced data analysis within SQL Server will be huge.  Also work on performance tuning. If you can't read a query plan, learn. If you aren't in the habit of tuning every large query you run, get in the habit. There are real purposes for distributed processing, but most companies don't actually need it. If you can partition a table with a clustered columnstore index, you can store a lot of data with excellent query performance, which will save your company a lot of money and you a lot of time debugging issues with distributed systems.#I am hearing a lot about R also, but NoSQL is another route to go. Learn CouchDB or the like. 
MBA;5z8cbf;1489445029.0;/r/MBA/comments/5z8cbf/profile_review_1st_individual_in_my_family_to/;Profile Review: 1st individual in my family to have attended college;*Background:*I'll start off by saying I originally thought of going to B-School locally in New Orleans to try and get out of the service industry and move more into Marketing/General management, which I'm interested in. I studied with Magoosh for 3 months, took the GMAT, and received a much better score than I expected. This caused me to shift my attention towards better schools but I don't really have the trajectory or background of most applicants. I'm trying to find out how to best focus my energy and what I should shoot for realistically. Besides my GMAT score, my only other real playing chip is that no one in my family, cousins and everyone included, has gone to college except for me and my younger sister, who is now attending undergrad. Other info is as follows.**Work experience**: Varied but has been pretty consistent since I was 15. Worked at a Sandwich/Ice Cream spot ages 15-17 during high school, then was a full time college student and worked at an Ace Hardware retail store for a year and 4 months. I then got a job working in the maintenance department of my university and moved into a quasi-project management role, which I held for 2 years. My following work experience is best detailed here:http://imgur.com/a/l84Mz**Extra Curricular**:Not much to put here unfortunately but I'm currently looking into volunteer opportunities. I'm a photographer and drummer by hobby and have been involved in both for about 10 years. I have a photo portfolio up at tylercorrea.com**Undergrad School/Major**:University of California, Santa CruzBA Sociology**Race/Nationality/Sex**:White/American/Male Age 25*Stats*:**Gmat Score**:740IR=7Q=48V=42Undergrad GPA= 3.52**Goal**:To switch out of my current industry and move into a management role at a more reputable company. I would then like to use experience gained through post-MBA employment to most likely start a small company with some other individuals. Of the available MBA concentrations I'm most interested in Marketing and more specifically big data/market research analysis. I've only read books on the subject and I'm currently in the process of certifying myself in Google Adwords, Google Analytics and Facebook Ads.My Target schools at the moment are UT McCombs, NYU Stern, UCLA Anderson, and Kellog Northwestern(biggest reach).Where do I go from here?I'd like to preemptively thank anyone who has taken a look at this, I've read many reviews in the past and find this subreddit to be an incredible resource. ;Hard stats = good. Work experience = terrible. Your work experience before and during college do not matter and it seems like your experience up to now has  been managing a restaurant. I think you'd be hard pressed getting an admittance to your target schools/reach. I'd apply to schools ranked 20-30 and if you want, maybe 2-3 reaches above that. You might need to work with a consultant to get your story straight. #[deleted]#You need two years of better experience. Consider something like the Peace Corps. Alternatively look into programs like Accounting/Finance masters which don't require prior experience. With your GMAT+GPA combo you'd be competitive for virtually all US MSF and accounting programs.      #What did you use to study to get a 740?#I can see a possible top 20 but 20-30 seem more like your matches. I'm not sure how adcoms will view your WE but for me, it looks pretty weak. No EC's is no help either.  Your stats are good but your story is kind of unclear. Were you originally from NO? If so, why did you attend a UC as an out of state student and pay private school level tuition? And then go back to NO just to become a restaurant manager? These are questions that will pop up in the adcom's minds and you should try to come up with a clear story.  I think McCombs, Stern, and Anderson can be reach schools you apply to but definitely look into more 20-35 schools that are good regionally in areas where you are okay with living in. If you really want to apply to Kellogg, go ahead. I would choose 1 dream school, 2-3 reaches, 3 matches, and possibly one safety. With your stats, one school is bound to accept you.#When did you graduate from UCSC?

While I know some are more experienced than I, I thought I'd take a moment to share what I've learned with the reddit community.Here's a process that I found worked for me:**Optional, but highly recommended - Start a blog**You will begin to see what things are like as a writer, and as someone who pitches to you. Using my blog has helped me to see what pitches worked well, and what pitches did not work well. This is just based on my personal experience, but I think journalists connect better with bloggers because they are fellow writers.Now then, on to the rest of the process.**1. Brainstorm the media outlets you want to be on.**Not all PR will create the same effect for your business. Believe it or not, sites like Entrepreneur, Inc., and Forbes are great for social proof (thus increasing future sales), and SEO, but not often great at immediate sales.If you want fast sales, I would recommend finding PR sites or large blogs closely tailored to your niche. Not only have I and many entrepreneurs I know have found this to be true, but Jason Feifer (editor-in-chief of Entrepreneur) recently stated this in an article in this month's Entrepreneur magazine (he provides some great insight on how to land press from the other side of the table. It's worth checking out, if you can get your hands on a copy).As a marketer, [writing on Sumo](https://sumo.com/stories/influencer-marketing-super-connector) (formerly SumoMe) has provided more leads than any other coverage I've received. This article also led to me being mentioned on [SalesForce](https://www.salesforce.com/ca/blog/2016/06/establish-relationships-with-influencers.html), [Copyblogger](http://www.copyblogger.com/evergreen-content/), and [featured on Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sherry-gray/influencer-marketing-in-a_b_9422550.html). (Again, this is why it's easier to have a blog).**2. Come up with PR relevant topics** If you notice from the places I got press, there are different ways you can share your story and be relevant to different journalists. For example, the Entrepreneur piece is geared towards those who want to start a side hustle. The Inc. article is geared towards someone who writes, or has a blog. The Forbes article touches on the work-life balance.What I did not do, was try to get PR specifically about my business, but shared valuable information that would allow me to talk about it. That's not to say that you can't get PR about your product, but it has to have a story worth telling.To find relevant journalists, brainstorm a few broad topics to talk about. For example, my friend Allen Walton runs [Spy Guy Security](https://spyguysecurity.com). An obvious topic he could discuss is on spyware. A less obvious topic is how to find out if your spouse is cheating on you. As a 7-figure solopreneur, there's another angle (which got him [coverage on Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2015/05/30/how-bold-entrepreneurs-are-breaking-1-million-in-one-person-businesses/#b41d2b51ec12)). He's also shared from his experience on [how to deal with a PR nightmare](http://www.inc.com/cheryl-snapp-conner/think-your-days-gone-poorly-consider-this-founders-pr-nightmare.html).The more ideas you come up with, the more opportunities are at your finger tips.**3.  Find the relevant journalists**You know the media outlets you want to be on, and the topics you can discuss. Please, do not spam every writer on that publication. Not only will your pitch fall flat, you'll be promptly ignored by everyone in their organization, and many others.Different journalists write about different topics. A journalist who writes about franchises could care less about your drop shipping business.So, how do you find the relevant journalists to reach out to?I like to use Buzzsumo, add in the site, and start plugging in a few keywords I found in the previous step ([here's an example](https://app.buzzsumo.com/research/most-shared?type=articles&result_type=total&num_days=365&general_article&infographic&video&guest_post&giveaway&interview&q=forbes.com%20big%20data&page=1)).Looks like Bernard Marr, Louis Columbus, and Gil Press are three big data writers for Forbes.**4. Properly pitch journalists.**It's almost time to get that coveted press you have been hoping for! There's a lot when it comes to pitching journalists, but here are some quick steps:* Find their email address. Here are [4 ways I've used to find almost anyone's email address](http://www.thestorytellermarketer.com/influencer-marketing-guide/#email-discovery).* Use a short, but descriptive subject line why you are emailing them. Even using “Quick question NAME” has worked well for me. But if I'm saying it will be a quick question, my email better not be more than two lines.* Create a concise email, describring why you are relevant, and ending with a question. Why end with a question? Because this opens up a dialogue.* Follow up at least once. A simple, “Hey NAME, Just wanted to send you a quick note to see if you caught my last message.”I have used this formula to get response rates between 40-60% (which is higher than most marketers get for *open* rates).If you want more information, here's some recommended reading:* [Blogger Outreach Tips: How To Write Outreach Emails That Don’t Suck](http://www.bloggingwizard.com/effective-blogger-outreach/)* [The Ultimate Guide to Influencer Marketing](https://sumo.com/stories/influencer-marketing-super-connector)* [6 Creative Ways To Use Email Outreach To Grow Your Startup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCoUXOve-eQ) **5. Get press, or die trying.**Once you get a response back, either you will get a yes, a no, or some kind of clarification from them.Don't get discouraged if the answer is a no. If you keep building the relationship, another opportunity may follow. I had a relationship with Nathan Resnick for a year-and-a-half before pitching my idea for the Entrepreneur article.

Big data; specific goals; well defined questions.... What else?";I work for an insurance company and I am planning on approaching upper management to promote the use for AI / Machine Learning / Deep Learning for specific functions such as pricing the insurance, minimizing losses and fraud detection.  I work with data in IT, but I have never touched AI before.One of the things I want management to understand is that Deep Learning is only useful in certain conditions, it is perfect some things, and not so great for others.  So when is Deep Learning most useful? What are the ideal conditions for a Machine Learning / Deep Learning project to be successful?  Here's what I have so far:AI/deep learning is ideal when:* You have a lot of data, structured or unstructured* You are trying to do something very specific goal - Well defined questions* You can train it based on desired outcomes* What else?I have googled this about 30 different ways now, and have failed to come up with a good list.Thanks for your help!!;"If you want the best chance for success you need to approach it completely different to the way you're thinking. First look at what is costing the business the most amount of money (ie. Fraudulent claims cost our business $150 M per annum). I'm sure you can find about 5 different scenarios/examples. Then paint the picture of how the information you already capture can be leveraged to lead to a reduction in this cost. Find reference material and research papers which demonstrate such applications of DL. Then, based on your data science expertise, work out what the likely saving would be from an implementation of DL that will result in (let's say) 20% of cases. Keep it high level, they are managers and therefore don't have time for detail. Then propose a POC based on and x% utilisation of your time and others if necessrry focusing on DL use case for one domain.  Go for it#It depends a lot on the questions you have to answer and the data you're working with.  But my advice would be to look over some basic machine learning/statistics which could help you know when to use, say classification to predict fraud or a regression to learn more about loss or something.  Basically, there are a lot of useful techniques out there besides deep learning (not that deep learning isn't useful, it's just very ""in"" right now), but it's hard to have a general guideline for when machine learning can be helpful. Or maybe I'm just blanking on what some general guidelines would be   edit: I'd recommend [this](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) book if you feel you have the math background for it#For a machine learning project to be successful, you need to have a goal in mind. Dont hire a data scientist just because everyone else is - you need a question, or range of questions, that they can answer.   You need at least some idea of some data that might go to support this - it doesn;t have to be everything, but if you dont have any data that supports this, it is already a disaster.  Do NOT run the early stage of this as a traditional IT project. You can't break it into sprints and apply a typical agile methodology to it. A lot of the start is going to be very much about R&D. Once you start to show some progress, THEN you can go to an Agile approach.   Another thing is having a data scientist who is good at communicating with your stakeholders. A good way to do it is to ask them to explain a neural network to you - see how they approach that, and if you're engaged by the answer at all.#Nothing works until it actually works in Deep Learning.#Most ML is still not deep learning.  Some extra things to consider:  Do you have to beat something that's already highly optimized (market prices, human grandmaster) or is any improvement valuable?  Will humans be trying to game your system? They can probably adapt faster than you can and they'll find flaws.  Are machine generated results acceptable? Minimizing a cost function doesn't always make customers happy if the errors are unnatural.  Do you need comprehensible predictions you can justify in court? #A critical bit people miss is that there must be some signal in the data. A good indication of this is a history of success with feature engineering, heuristics, and intuition. If the problem is important enough, humans are awfully good at getting getting close to the bayes optimal classifier in any particular problem. This may not always be true - but its a good approximation.  There's a somewhat plausible, but imo wrong, belief out there that computers can detect patterns in data humans cannot. But I've not found a single example where this is true - at least not in a field which is important enough to merit human analysis. I'd be happy to be proven wrong.#Deep learning has been successful with machine translation (translating text), image recognition, speech recognition, speech generation, and a few other assorted ""party tricks"" (which, admittedly, are very cool!). There is no AI with common sense or reasoning and there won't be any time soon."

Some examples: China is using algorithms to develop a 'Citizen Score' which will allow the government to easily decide who gets privileges such as loans and the right to travel. This sort of thing is also coming to the West.

Recent headlines include: “Oil Price Fall Forces North Dakota to Consider Austerity” (New York Times) “Oil Price Drop Hurts Spending on Business Investments” (Wall Street Journal)  “The American Oil Boom Won’t Last Long at $65 per Barrel”(Bloomberg Business)  and “The Shale Oil Revolution Is in Danger” (Fortune).High prices, shale skeptics argue, created a bubble of activity in unsustainably expensive shale fields. As shale-related businesses contract, consolidate, and adjust to the new price regime, a major shale bust is inevitable, they add, with ghost towns littering idle fields from Texas to North Dakota.  It is true that the oil-price collapse was caused by the astonishing, unexpected growth in U.S. shale output, responsible for three-fourths of new global oil supply since 2008. And as lower prices roil operators and investors, the shale skeptics’ case may seem vindicated. But their history is false: the shale revolution, “Shale 1.0,” was sparked not by high prices—it began when prices were at today’s low levels—but by the invention of new technologies. Now, the skeptics’ forecasts are likely to be as flawed as their history. This paper explains how continued technological progress, particularly in big-data analytics, has the U.S. shale industry poised for another, longer boom, a “Shale 2.0.”The End of the BeginningJohn Shaw, chair of Harvard’s Earth and Planetary Sciences Department, recently observed: “It’s fair to say we’re not at the end of this [shale] era, we’re at the very beginning.”  He is precisely correct. In recent years, the technology deployed in America’s shale fields has advanced more rapidly than in any other segment of the energy industry. Shale 2.0 promises to ultimately yield break-even costs of $5–$20 per barrel—in the same range as Saudi Arabia’s vaunted low-cost fields.The shale industry is unlike any other conventional hydrocarbon or alternative energy sector, in that it shares a growth trajectory far more similar to that of Silicon Valley’s tech firms. In less than a decade, U.S. shale oil revenues have soared, from nearly zero to more than $70 billion annually (even after accounting for the recent price plunge). Such growth is 600 percent greater than that experienced by America’s heavily subsidized solar industry over the same period.  Shale’s spectacular rise is also generating massive quantities of data: the $600 billion in U.S. shale infrastructure investments and the nearly 2,000 million well-feet drilled have produced hundreds of petabytes of relevant data. This vast, diverse shale data domain—comparable in scale with the global digital health care data domain—remains largely untapped and is ripe to be mined by emerging big-data analytics.Shale 2.0 will thus be data-driven. It will be centered in the United States. And it will be one in which entrepreneurs, especially those skilled in analytics, will create vast wealth and further disrupt oil geopolitics. The transition to Shale 2.0 will take the following steps:1. Oil from Shale 1.0 will be sold from the oversupply currently filling up storage tanks.2. More oil will be unleashed from the surplus of shale wells already drilled but not in production.3. Companies will “high-grade” shale assets, replacing older techniques with the newest, most productive technologies in the richest parts of the fields.4.As the shale industry begins to embrace big-data analytics, Shale 2.0 begins.Further, if the U.S. is to fully reap the economic and geopolitical benefits of Shale 2.0, Congress and the administration should:1. Remove the old, no longer relevant, rules prohibiting American companies from selling crude oil overseas.2. Remove constraints, established by the 1920 Merchant Marine Act, on transporting domestic hydrocarbons by ship.3. Avoid inflicting further regulatory hurdles on an already heavily regulated industry.4. Open up and accelerate access to exploration and production on federally controlled lands.TL DR TL DR	The price of shale oil will continue to decrease bigly due to big data.  Barring a major geopolitical shift or fuckup, oil will likely not go back above 60/barrel for the forseeable future.  Go long petroleum companies, fuck Tesla.  If CHK doesn’t fucking collapse under debt they could see big returns from fracking in the next decade.  WSB TL DRShort TSLA Long CHK ;"Long CHK, longer TSLA#I'm getting stacks on stacks on UCO/SCO put writing#[deleted]#TL;DR PRICE OF OIL WILL HIT $65/bbl IN 2017, GET IN WHILE YOU CAN#it seems oil companies are feeling the same way the article does, oil has been going up while many many oil company stocks have been staying stagnant. OPEC cuts aren't going to be doing anything but giving American oil breathing room. It's over for middle eastern oil. They need 100 dollar barrels to sustain their government budgets. While advancement and hopefully deregulation from Trump will only make fracking cheaper and cheaper."

The first step of my project was downloading the entire blockchain and transforming it from a sequence of binary files to a friendlier, more useful text format using Hadoop MapReduce.Now that I have this data, I'm having trouble coming up with something to do with it. I've read previous papers (Traveling the silk road, de-anonymizing users from transactions, etc...). Does anyone have any ideas of what I can use the data for? For instance, what cool things can I visualize with it? Maybe I can compare it with other currencies of the world to prove some point? Maybe analyze transaction volume to predict future transaction volume, etc... I'm relatively new to bitcoin so it's hard for me to think of something feasible and useful. Any ideas? Thank you.;"Try to confuse the other data miners as much as you can. #Plot the relationship between transaction size, fee paid, and transaction time. I think we would all like to see how these trends change over time and how tech/political change affects it. #I would like to see an in depth analysis of all non traditional transactions, like P2SH.  Find and group them.#Maybe there's something useful   - https://www.quandl.com/data/BCHAIN/BCDDW-Bitcoin-Days-Destroyed-Minimum-Age-1-Week - https://github.com/TimDaub/timdaub.github.io - https://github.com/patcon/parkdale-days-destroyed  <-- What a coincidence, created today  I think every attempt to do this is doing so based on mined blocks.  I don't think anyone is including mempool (unconfirmed) transactions.  That would be like an ""early warning"" indicator.  One might be able to predict price moves on the exchanges by analyzing moves (of older coins) on the blockchain.  This used to be something where there was a correlation ... years ago.  Big dumps at the exchanges were preceded by big transfers of old coins (as deposits to the exchanges).    Then it was so easily faked that I don't know many traders that still employed that strategy.    But now with blocks being full and fees being high, there is probably not much ""fake"" activity and instead, Bitcoin Days Destroyed might again be an interesting signal.  And including mempool activity gets rid of the lag before a confirmation occurs, adding value to the metric.       But watch for attempts to fake out your BDD from those spending old coins but with a fee to low that it never confirms.     You might also try to exclude from the BDD transactions from exchanges.  That's harder to detect but maybe ChainAnalysis' work might provide a way you can figure out which are from exchanges."

MBA;5wfe5w;1488179483.0;/r/MBA/comments/5wfe5w/mba_programs_starting_to_emphasize_coding/;MBA Programs Starting to Emphasize Coding;Companies want to hire technically skilled MBAs, and business schools are finally starting to get it. MBA programs equip students with management techniques, accounting skills and, increasingly, entrepreneurship chops. Some top programs, however, believe MBAs should learn to code.Harvard Business School is planning to offer a computer programming elective within a couple of years, says Paul Gompers, who chairs the MBA elective curriculum. Students have formed coding clubs, and dozens go “across the river” to take the introductory computer science class at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. But professors need to tailor a course specifically to business students in Boston, says Gompers.“This is the changing nature of the workforce, and this is what our graduates are going on to be doing in the next five to 10 to 20 years.”Elite MBA programs have been slow to adapt, even though plenty of schools started specialized master’s programs in big data and analytics. A pair of springtime reports by the Graduate Management Admission Council revealed a disconnect between the skills MBA programs give students and what employers want. While recent graduates said they learned the least about “technology, design, etc.” and “managing tools and technology” out of any other skills in B-schools, U.S. employers said they coveted “technical and quantitative skills” third out of 10 criteria.“We’ve got a lot of MBAs graduating and going off to be high-tech product managers. If you look at that world, there are a bunch of big tech companies that insist that anyone in that role be technical — understand code well enough to read it and write it,” says Thomas Eisenmann, an HBS professor who teaches a course on product management.Companies don’t want an army of programmers from B-schools — they can recruit from computer science programs for that — but they need managers who know the basics of code to work with technical staff. To be a product manager at Amazon, for instance, MBAs need to “dive into data and be technically conversant,” says Miriam Park, director of university programs at the company.At New York University’s Stern School of Business, economics professor David Backus plans to start a course that will teach students how to visualize data and use the programming language, Python. “I’ve talked to people I know at other B-schools, and they haven’t heard of anything really like this. It’s surprising,” he says.Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, a B-school with a reputation as a tech powerhouse, has no coding classes. Students have been able to take computer science courses at the university since fall 2012  Madhav Rajan, the business school’s senior associate dean for academic affairs, says this obviates the need for a focus on coding. Last year, the B-school and the School of Engineering launched a joint degree that confers an MBA and an MS in computer science.One downside of learning to code at B-school: Coding is hard. HBS students who took the university’s introductory computer science course said that they spent 16.3 hours a week on the course, which is “2-3 [times] more time than they would spend on an MBA elective that yielded equivalent academic credit,” wrote Eisenmann in a Harvard Business Review blog post last fall.Backus says schools should make coding electives available but avoid requiring them so that MBAs don’t feel burdened. “Students could get annoyed at you and think it’s too hard.”;Good for engineers like me who may be going to b school! Coding is ez!!#[deleted]#Totally sucks for me, a business grad. I guess before I start bschool I have to actually pick up proper coding/data analytics to the point I can communicate well. Ohhh the pros and the cons.#For the non-engineers, how much coding/CS knowledge will be enough? People spend their entire careers are engineers and it's impossible to compete with them.#I agree but they are helpful in the long run, and soon there's gonna be a portal dedicated to management students to help them sail smoothly thru' their assignments#Coding would be targetted to those students who would opt for systems as their specialisations #U welcome buddy :)

Generally speaking, we use python as an all purpose tool, which means we prefer using python as a single language to tackle everything as opposed to multiple languages and fighting the integrations.   So where would I tell you to spend your time? Learn to use python on tools like databricks, apache zeppelin, or jupyter notebooks. Find a data set either through searching or to answer a question you have. Put your data in an AWS S3 bucket and use python to connect to it, cleanse and manipulate the data, and then plot it using an interactive library like plotly. Build a dashboard from the data set with descriptive and predictive statistics using geo, boxplots, and time series charts. Accomplishing this will teach you python, statistics, visualization tools, distributed computing, apache spark, working with arrays and likely linux if going the apache zeppelin route. If you set up apache zeppelin on AWS EMR, you could spin it up and show it off during interviews as well.  I would follow that up with research into how python is used and integrated into production products at scale. At this point, learning the concepts and being able to speak intelligently about them will get your foot in the door.   Rinse and repeat after that - good luck!#This might be helpful:  https://www.edx.org/course/programming-python-data-science-microsoft-dat210x-2#There are also a lot of videos out there that cover python and data mining etc.#Thanks a lot all"

We currently schedule many tasks through MS SQL agent to hit teradata, ASTER, oracle, and vertica DBs through regular ETL processes for reporting etc. What i would like to know is.  Is there a fairly standard query that would identify tables, columns and possibly unique values for the entirety of a database?I know there are software programs out there that will map a database, and i know that there are queries that can be used to get the basics of a known table, but is there a query that can be used to discover new tables or columns in tables that could be run through an ETL process?Any Ideas?EDIT:  End result is output to a website.  Something that we could manually edit when new tables or columns would present themselves. we could do the research and add descriptions to the new columns, tables, or values.  also include pertinent join information etc. ;I may be misunderstand the question.

When you run the scripts you can identify new objects, add them to your metadata store and then with metadata logic decide if you want to build and deploy new ssis packages or whatever for handling. Takes some time to learn but will be very valuable as your project expands or runs for a long time.  To check out if this is for you try the free versions and build your own metadata store or get a licence for BIML studio (there is also a free trial for something like 2 weeks): https://varigence.com/bimlstudio

However my colleague insists that I need to run all my data through a more complicated programme e.g. R, SAS, SPSS etc. to ensure that it is water tight before I can submit my paper.I'm interested in your opinions and experiences - as I haven't used any of these programmes myself, it seems a bit odd for him to insist that I learn them just to redo the stats I've already done.  I've been in research since 2006 and never had any issues until now, and never had any issues getting things to publication.  I'm certainly not going to lie and claim I've checked my very simple stats in a more complex programme just to satisfy my colleague so we can move forward to publication.  Thoughts? Any similar experiences?;It's perfectly fine to use graphpad prism for basic analysis. What matters more is understanding the tests you are performing and ensuring your data fits within the limits of it. If you don't want to learn R, it's still good to be more cognizant of your actual data analysis. For example, just using a histogram to eyeball the shape of your data before a t-test could save you from bad stats if your data is not normally distributed. #As /u/multi-mod pointed out, Graphpad Prism is absolutely fine to use. It is a statistical program designed and programmed for biology and their statistics is sound.  It doesn't matter if you use Prism, SPSS or R, they all will give you the same results...   It might be true that you can't do some specific, extravaganza tests, but in my experience, most often you don't need them. Just be sure what kind of data you have and what test is appropriate for your question... And that you don't break the premises for the tests... Graphpad provides very detailed manuals for all kinds of test and data requirements, so look them up and decide to your best knowledge...#I guess it depends on your field/data but I've never had a problem using just GraphPad

If I was in the field for the money, I'd be devastated at how much marketing bullshit there is for tech pay in general.Those six figure base salaries you hear about? They're usually in areas where renting or buying your own place is going to cost you a minimum of $20,000 (or more) a year if you want to be in a decent area that isn't too far from work. You can get around this with cheaper rent but a soul-crushing commute that will destroy your body even faster from all the sitting.Don't forget that this is a very tough career - you'll be working a lot in order to earn that salary. There's a lot of competition, and for the career paths making $150,000 or more...(think machine learning, big data, finance)...you'll be spending most of your waking hours working or thinking about work. There are definitely exceptions to the rule, but getting into those fields requires some coveted education and some grueling hours.It's certainly a good career choice if you're looking to be a career man/woman. But you won't be getting rich or even that well off working for someone else, and that isn't going to change just because it's ""tech."" Don't chase the dragon - if you want a big pay check, there are other avenues that are going to be much better for your pocket book all things considered. Time to temper your expectations for the field - computer science isn't some bastion of well-paid jobs in an economy of low-paying jobs.

They're usually in areas where renting or buying your own place is going to cost you a minimum of $20,000 (or more) a year  Yet you still end up having more disposable income after rent, how is this so hard to grasp?#I respect the fact that you are an impassioned programer who don't need no money, but passion is not the primary motive most people have when deciding on what career to embark upon. Also with CS you can make 60k starting out in low cost areas in the midwest and the south. While these prospects are not as high as the west coast they stand as a testament to the value of being a programmer in terms of return on time invested/college debt. The average salary in those areas pale in comparison to a 22 year programmer.  In addition, don't write off electricians and plumbers as having easy work, the jobs can be very labor intensive and can work very long hours depending on circumstances such as outages or other regular acts of god.  #The COL argument comes up every once in a while, but it doesn't really hold since it's the difference you care about and not the ratio. E. g. you're better off paying 30K a year in rent out of the 100K you have in hand post-tax, than paying 10K a year out of 50K somewhere in the mid-west.   Also, maybe your experience differs, but 40-45 hour weeks seem to be the norm. Younger people might think it's a good idea to spend all day at work, but people with family/SOs/hobbies are pretty much out at 5.#I'm going to disagree with you in just about every point you made.  > They're usually in areas where renting or buying your own place is going to cost you a minimum of $20,000 (or more) a year  Granted paying for rent in Silicon Valley isn't easy, but the pay for top companies scales so much higher than the rent and other costs, that it's worth it financially. People with high salaries in high COL areas can and often do take home more money even after high taxes, costs, etc.  > Don't forget that this is a very tough career - you'll be working a lot in order to earn that salary.  Every job that is high paying is difficult. You don't have to seek the most difficult ones. You can easily carve a nice career for yourself not pursuing the most difficult fields. This subreddit talks about living in some midwest state doing enterprise work all the time. But MDs have to pay their dues as well to get their high salaries. So do lawyers, investment bankers, etc.  > Time to temper your expectations for the field - computer science isn't some bastion of well-paid jobs in an economy of low-paying jobs.  Not everyone is earning 6 figures, but this job on average pays better than most. An electrician or a plumber will NOT be making more than you as a programmer unless you're being paid far below the average.

You can get some of those parts cheaper on eBay if you do not mind using eBay.  The processors together should cost about the same as one processor you have listed if you buy them on eBay.  Make sure to get the SR0KX stepping because there was a bug in the first stepping that broke VT-d.  You might not want to do hardware passthrough now, but you never know what you might want to do in the future.  For RAM, you can save money going for used registered ECC 1333 memory on eBay.  You can get 16GB for somewhere in the neighborhood of $40.  Unless you upgrade to E5 v2s, you are not going to notice a difference with 1866 memory in that setup.  Also, with the E5s, you can put more ECC RAM in the system than non-ECC memory.  Depending on the VMs you are running, you might need more memory.  For the power supply, you are going to need one with two EPS (8 pin) connectors for the motherboard.  I think the only you listed has them, but it is something you will want to double check before pulling the trigger.  For an SSI EEB board, you will likely need a full tower, but it sounds like you are good to go there.#I found the 16 GB sticks of RAM to be a better value for my build. That board can go up to 512gb but the 32gb modules are super expensive and the 16gb can be purchased for $80 each.  Also, you can get those processors on eBay for about $80 less each depending on the market. Make sure to get the model SR0KX  Make sure your case supports SSI EEB.

MLQuestions;5ys8zl;1489231646.0;/r/MLQuestions/comments/5ys8zl/size_of_dataset_and_the_limit_to_train/;Size of dataset and the limit to train scikit-learn model?;Hi, newbie here. I'm just wondering, from most of the dataset that Ive seen in [kaggle](https://kaggle.com), they are only a few MB. Is there any particular limits on how big the data I can use to train and build model using scikit-learn? A lot of big data articles I've read say that big data would have GB and up to TB of data. Does that GBs of data only for 1 dataset or actually a combination of multiple dataset? Sorry if this is a noob question;We currently use scikit-learn in production (as part of auto_ml) across tens of millions of events, and hundreds of features for each event.   To give you a sense of how much data scikit-learn can handle, we recently maxed out a box with 128GB of RAM only because one of the algorithms needed to densify a sparse matrix at prediction time. Otherwise, it was easily fitting into a low few dozen GB of RAM.   For what it's worth, we use [auto_ml](https://github.com/ClimbsRocks/auto_ml), where I recently incorporated Microsoft's LightGBM. They handle categorical columns more memory-efficiently than scikit-learn does, so it's even easier for us to run Medium Data datasets of millions of things on a laptop.   It's fun to geek out on speccing out an enormous ML box with an even more enormous GPU, but if you're working with tabular data (most non-image kaggle competitions), you can make it work on any semi-decent laptop. #Think of the Cambridge Analytica descriptions of their data set.  They have some 5,000 data points on each of 250,000,000 Americans.  Estimate that each data point is up to 10 bytes of data.  That gives 12.5 million million bytes.  Megabyte = 1 million B.  Gigabyte = 1 billion B or 10 to the 9.  Terabyte = 10 to the 12.  So Cambridge Analytica has 12 Tetrabytes of data.  That much disk space in a tidy rack will cost you about $1000 to purchase, or roughly half that per year if you rent it.  Conclusion: most of what is called big data is not that big.  It gets big when you have lots of images or video. Even music or speech aren't that large.  Generally the tools on the market are fine with these data volumes.   Its processing time that get long, and that is where GPU arrays (eg Amazon's EC2 versions) come in.#The limit is the amount of RAM you have on your machine.

AppleWatch;5x5coi;1488482941.0;/r/AppleWatch/comments/5x5coi/new_aw_wearer_small_annoyances_and_limitations/;New AW Wearer: Small Annoyances and Limitations;I recently got an Apple Watch Series 2 to replace my Microsoft Band. Despite having an iPhone, Macbook Pro, iPad, and AppleTV, for the last 2 years I wore a Microsoft Band (Gen 1 and 2). The MS Band, ironically enough was nearly perfect for my desired features: GPS running, pedometer, sleep tracker, and alarm.  I really liked the big data analysis MS was/is doing with MS Health pulling together data from the myriad of sensors (i.e. you sleep more/less than the average male your age).  I went into the AW knowing it wasn't as tightly focused on fitness and have been impressed with the battery life, the screen, and notification. But, feels like I'm fighting a bunch of small annoyances or limitations for things that should be fairly simple or inconsequential. * Why do I need to install a 3rd part app to get step count on the watch face?* Why can't I set a set count goal (can only get move goal)* No native sleep tracker* Why does the screen turn off when in nightstand mode?  * Sharing walk/run calibration data?  I know RunKeeper currently doesn't do indoor non-GPS tracking using this data. Do any?* Ran using workout app and run didn't migrate over to RunKeeper (likely a RK issue) * Similarly, why do I need to go back to the phone for a consolidated Health dashboard/app? * Heart Rate sensor isn't as consistent;">it wasn't as tightly focused on fitness  I would say the Apple Watch is _very_ focused on fitness.  >Why do I need to install a 3rd part app to get step count on the watch face?  [Steps aren't real](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/5o0vhu/looking_for_a_solution_for_apple_watch_step/dcfqxk3/). I'd recommend just sticking to the Activity rings, as it's a better measure of...err... activity.  >No native sleep tracker  This is a fair annoyance. But I'd like to counter that sleep tracking is kind of silly. If you wake up and you're tired, you didn't sleep well or enough. I've also never seen an accurate sleep tracker in my life. [Pillow](https://neybox.com/pillow/) comes close, though.  >Why does the screen turn off when in nightstand mode?  Another fair annoyance. I always thought it was because you wouldn't want the display acting as a small light source while you were trying to get to sleep. This is the reason I stopped buying proper nightstand clocks. Also, that tap-the-table-to-wake is so nice and convenient.  >Sharing walk/run calibration data? I know RunKeeper currently doesn't do indoor non-GPS tracking using this data. Do any?  I'm not sure what you mean, but the built in Exercise app will do indoor walks/runs.  >Ran using workout app and run didn't migrate over to RunKeeper (likely a RK issue)  I've only used RunKeeper a handful of times, but it might just be an issue with the RunKeeper app updating from HealthKit. Sometimes, MyFitnessPal won't ""pick up"" my workouts until after I open the Activity app. Kinda weird.  >Similarly, why do I need to go back to the phone for a consolidated Health dashboard/app?  It's partly because the data lives on the phone (it doesn't sync via iCloud or anything, for privacy reasons) and because Apple just hasn't figured out how to cram all of that information in to a UI that works on a 1"" screen. But mostly, it's because the data lives on the phone. The Watch can record data and send it over, and read the data when connected, but it won't sync the two over so you can view your data without the phone.  >Heart Rate sensor isn't as consistent Make sure the watch is on snug and the sensors are clear."
learnpython;5yl2bm;1489135674.0;/r/learnpython/comments/5yl2bm/can_anyone_offer_any_suggestions_as_to_what_kind/;Can anyone offer any suggestions as to what kind of programming I should focus on?;"I wanted to ask this here because this community has always been so supportive and I am currently feeling really stuck. I love programming, I can literally do it all day long, and since I started learning to program it has changed my life. I can build things, I can do all kinds of awesome stuff and it feels like I have all the power in the world at my fingertips (literally) but there's just SO much out there. There's backend and frontend, but that's just the beginning, you have people who focus on apps and content creation, pentesters, there are likely as many types of programming jobs as there are other jobs, because computers are everywhere now. I have to admit, I'm really struggling. I know the types of programming I love, and the kind I really don't care much for, and but I don't really know exactly what kind of job would let me do what I love. I really could care less about money, as long as I make enough to support myself (meaning food, shelter, and being able to afford to update my PC setup every couple years) I am content. I was hoping that somebody who's maybe been in my situation, would have some advice. Here's a couple things I really enjoy:I love mathematical programming, convolutions, summations, turning for loops and lists into sigma and setsI enjoy studying and implementing algorithms and trying to invent my own versions of existing algorithmsI really enjoy string manipulation and type manipulation, I like to really push my programs to the limit, I tend to write dense powerful functions that often end up being overly dynamic! (By overly dynamic I mean things like performing dynamic list creation when you don't know how many lists you need using exec('for I in range({}):\n\tmy_list{}=[]'.format(x,y)) or just stuff similar to that! )I love functions and functional programming, I never really liked classes, I can use them, I understand when they are valuable, I just don't like them. I am proficient in Python, and learning Java, PHP, and SQL currently. What types of jobs might be a good fit for me? I was thinking big data because the idea of having billions of data points to sift and sort through is super exciting, but I really want to hear from people who have experience in the field! TLDR: I really like programming, but I'm not really sure what ""type"" of programming I want to go into. I'm hoping to get either a better description of what different ""classes"" of programmers do, or to obtain recommendations on paths to look into based on my interests! ";[deleted]#If you are comfortable with math then try some GPU programming, maybe OpenGL or writing your own engine, either for general gaming or for physics. From there, you could either support games as a core developer, or you could go into simulations and predictions if you like physics more than graphics.  As far as doing what you love, nothing pushes math and optimization harder than 3D virtual worlds. Games may carry a stigma with you as being a casual interest, but games involve real-time limitations and sometimes dense complex functions to pull off rendering while maintaining target FPS. A full AAA game hits nearly every aspect of computer science along the way, especially when hardware is limited.  Big data is a big buzz word right now but honestly search / sort / run stats is only so interesting for so long. Yes, optimization comes into play which is fun but you could get bored with it as a whole.  Now on the science side of things a ton of r&d involves huge data sets while also tapping math and functions all over the place. Climate simulations, human genome project, things like that.  Just some ideas to ponder.#Have you tried shaders? have a play at https://www.shadertoy.com/ and if you like what you see, maybe look at Unity or UE4. Nothing rewards sneaky math tricks like shaders.#machine learning

Every time I start a modded game with the vanilla intro or Live Another Live (shuffled), I can create a character and I have tried with multiple setups. The first was when I had a lot of FNIS related mods, ran the exe for new animations (with extensive research on what optional mods and FNIS plugins were needed), and used RC + RM, and the USLP with the various patches, SkyUI, and other necessary mods on all of the pages. I had HDT and all of my necessary compatible skeletons. For graphical purposes, I ran Realvision ENB with all of the recommended mods and tweaked the appropriate skyrim, skyrimprefs, enblocal, and SKSE inis in the mod organizer folder. After failing multiple tweaks to the setup to get it working, I tried removing all of the animation related mods and FNIS and simply going with all of the texture and additional land/quest/equipment mods that are not dependent on things I got rid of like the underground bathhouse.My rig:    (for parallel processing/gpu processing big data analysis in Python when not gaming)    Windows 7 64bit    NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti sc+    Intel i7-4930k CPU 3.4GHz    32 GB ram    I have a cheap monitor (next thing I am upgrading) that is only a recommended 1600x900 resolution    For the advanced display memory settings it shows:    Graphics Memory: 5857 MB    Dedicated Video Memory: 2048 MB    SVM: 0    Shared System Memory: 3809 MBNaturally memory shouldn't be an issue in this case. I'll link my ini memory settings, pap log during most recent crash, MO modlist, and MO loadorder. I have been fiddling with memory after reading numerous posts online about crashes at Helgen and most have recommended the memory patch (which I have) and/or alternative start because of the horrible scripting complications with the intro and tutorial.INIs:    enblocal    http://pastebin.com/0fJsC6SFskyrim    http://pastebin.com/8UUZkFvXskyrimprefs    http://pastebin.com/hr9hfJDimodlist    http://pastebin.com/wY4HfVhBload order    http://pastebin.com/UjeNBbBVSKSE.ini (memory patch settings)    http://pastebin.com/61PZD64yMost Recent Papyrus log    http://pastebin.com/Lr32g8qEIn the Papyrus log there are some things near the top mentioning mods I removed in MO like RaceMenu... From my understanding, the only things I run in my actual Skyrim folder are the 2 files from the ENB archive in the skyrim folder (the rest of ENB stuff is in MO mods section) and the TES5edit is ran outside when cleaning masterfiles (which is all that I cleaned with the EXACT same results as Gophers videos). I used to use NMM, so I am curious if there is more that I need to do when using MO to uninstall mods  since I had understood it that you do not need to worry about overwrites in the mod folders themselves but purely in the install and load orders when running the game through SKSE which is ran through MO?Anyway, if anyone has some advice or if you locate issues or know a fix, then that would be great. As it is, I have my entire Skyrim folder backed up from a vanilla install including backed up ini files purely set up for vanilla first execution. I would just like to avoid redoing all of the mods if possible...;"> I used to use NMM  > In the Papyrus log there are some things near the top mentioning mods I removed in MO like RaceMenu  Did you fully clear out the Data folder from when you were using NMM? It sounds like there's still old files from a previous install.  It also looks like you've tried to install SKSE through Mod Organizer, which isn't something you can do; it has to be installed directly to your Skyrim folder.#I should add that I ran the official enb sites vram test and I have over 22 GB worth lol (22144MB to be exact). So I am not sure what I should set things to since it said old formulas shouldn't be used.  http://i.imgur.com/c6jSFgu.png#Well I changed things up and started from scratch after discovering various issues with SKSE versions and the realvision recommendations. I instead went with 353 mods focusing primarily on textures, new lands, vanilla town overhauls, and pretty much everything on this list and a few dozen of my own choices.  http://textup.fr/183221zP   I knew it shouldn't be an issue with my rig, after properly setting my inis based on these recommendations and using 512 or higher for LOD and 2k/4k textures when available, I don't have any CTD issues after 5 hours of playing.  Took me a while to learn the proper order for merged patch, batched patch,  DynoDOLOD, FNIS, Dual Sheath Redux, etc.   Basically I have this plus better water and different choices for movement when installing realistic animations project - movement.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PkcJCyStTk"

Accounting;5wod6x;1488293262.0;/r/Accounting/comments/5wod6x/us_internal_or_external_it_audit/;[US] Internal or External IT Audit?;As the title implies, I am attempting to decide between careers in external or internal IT audit. Currently, I have 1.5 years of experience working at a regional (DC area) public accounting firm, primarily for federal agencies. The work there is mostly in support of financial statement audits, with some advisory work mixed in as well. I have received an offer from the internal audit department of a financial corporation in the DC area, which I am considering, however my current firm has indicated that they would like me to stay, and that they believe that I have potential to make partner in 5-7 years.  In terms of compensation, the internal audit department offered a 10% pay bump, with a signing bonus, and overall has slightly better benefits/bonuses, however I think it is likely that my current firm would be willing to match (or possibly exceed) anything, though I won't know until I actually get a counteroffer. That being said, I'm looking at this less from a compensation perspective, and more from a long-term career one. Overall I think that I would like to work towards the C-suite (CISO or CIO), but I'm not dead set on anything. These are my thoughts:  **External Audit**  *Pros*  *I know the culture is relaxed, and I am already well-respected at my company  *Variety of clients, meaning a variety of experience  *Partners claim that they make significantly more than an equivalent position in internal audit  *I would potentially have the ability to help the company expand our service offerings (cyber security and data analytics were their thoughts)  *Cons*  *All work is federal, so I'm worried about being stuck in government work (not that I intend to move, but I don't like not having the option to)  *If I were given the option to help lead the company in new service offerings, that'd be great experience, but I would be concerned with doing things the wrong way since it would be lots of improvising  *Most people in external IT audit that I know seem to stay in this field forever, so I'm not sure if staying in this field would be limiting down the road  **Internal Audit**  *Pros*  *The technology used is much more advanced (cloud-based environments, professional reporting software, and big data analytics tools)  *Rotation programs with the technology department, where members of the internal audit team frequently move to after a few years  *Gaining commercial experience, which I few as opening more doors (though that definitely could be an incorrect assumption)  *Cons*  *While the company with the offer appears to have a relaxed culture and nice people, I obviously don’t really know (Glassdoor reviews were mixed, overall good though)  *From reading other comments online, there seems to be a mixed outlook on whether internal audit provides room for career growth and high pay (vs eventually becoming a partner at a public accounting firm)  If you’ve made it this far, then thanks for reading, I know this is a long post. Does anyone have any experience with making a similar change, or any thoughts on how to approach this?  TL DR: two good opportunities, what do I do?;"A few thoughts:  Your regional firm is bullshitting you with all the partner talk. Stop drinking the kool-aid. They are using an improbable future as justification for underpaying you.  A 10% bump is not very good, especially for someone at your level where it simply isn't that much money.  You should be getting nearly 10% raises every year in external, especially if you are truly on ""the partner track"". If you aren't getting here that, refer back to my first point.   External almost always promotes faster than internal. While internal pays more for equal positions, you can get to a higher position (and thus more pay) faster with external.   Final thought: it's confusing that you only have 1.5 years experience but your statements make it sound like you are at a manager level. Either there's some facts I'm missing, or you are over-estimating how much your firm cares about you. I'm guessing the latter, but I could be wrong.  #What exactly will you be auditing in internal?

As a self-taught developer who is pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science via [OMSCS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/), is it wise to look for internships while still in the program? Or should I actually start to find a place where I plan on working at for the next 3 ~ 5 years?I am currently working at a startup as a senior developer, but I've been looking for a different job because I want to see what working at other companies are like and look for more guidance.I was initially interviewing for a senior developer position at a startup, but I was finally offered a junior developer position. I understand that my lack of an undergraduate degree in Computer Science could be a reason why they think I only deserve a junior role, and I totally understand that I don't really fit for a senior role either as I only have 2~3 years of experience. However, I've been helping a friend with his undergraduate degree in CS, so I know that I can't be THAATT bad either.So here's the question. I feel that I can learn tons as a junior developer at that startup, as I will be helping them with big data technology such as Cassandra, Spark, and distributed computing problem with micro-services. I am also in the process of interviewing with Facebook, and I'm just waiting to hear back from them(although I don't have much expectation from it.).In 1~2 years, with a combination of 4~5 years of experience, and a Master's degree, I think I will have a better chance at working at something that truly interests me. So what should I do in between? Is it better to find multiple internships in Canada(I live in Vancouver, and I'm not eligible for internships in US) for the next 1~2 years and find an area that interests me the most, while risk not being able to find any internship, OR find a place where I can learn a lot and potentially grow, but unsure whether the startup really interests me.;Why would you need an internship if you already have  dev job?

The first step of my project was downloading the entire blockchain and transforming it from a sequence of binary files to a friendlier, more useful text format using Hadoop MapReduce.Now that I have this data, I'm having trouble coming up with something to do with it. I've read previous papers (Traveling the silk road, de-anonymizing users from transactions, etc...). Does anyone have any ideas of what I can use the data for? For instance, what cool things can I visualize with it? Maybe I can compare it with other currencies of the world to prove some point? Maybe analyze transaction volume to predict future transaction volume, etc... I'm relatively new to bitcoin so it's hard for me to think of something feasible and useful. Any ideas? Thank you.;Here are some ideas:  Usage stats. Adoption Rate (New Addresses included in the blockchain per unit of time) Address Reuse Rates (How many times is a bitcoin address used? What's the mean time between reuse?)  Can you figure out how much of the blockchain is coinwashing and how much is legit stuff?  I'd like to see a chart like http://themisescircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Bitcoin-Inflation.png where you can see all the coins produced over time but I also want to see how they're distributed among addresses or address groups for known-owners.

I also think that I could learn a lot on technologies that will be important in the future (big data/machine learning and the like)I was basically offered the same salary that I have now, which I wasn't able to negotiate, but I would be receiving stock options and a ""Senior"" title.The thing is that I usually see a job change as a way to receive a better salary, and this subreddit seems to show that it is the case most of the time.Career-wise, do you think that such a move would be beneficial?";"My first job change took me from a company of over 150,000 employees to one that was 15 at its biggest. It was a good move for me. I learned that I like working for smaller companies where I can have broader responsibilities. If you've been at the bigger company for a few years, and gotten a sense of what that's like, I'd encourage you to take the new opportunity. View it as a learning experience: learn about how companies work (you'll see it in a lot more detail at a smaller company, if you keep your eyes open), and you'll learn about yourself.

Don't make any decision based on them  Sage advice there.  Since it sounds like you will still get a good salary, it's the other facets that you should focus on. In a small start up like that, you will have a lot of influence over how things happen. You will also (likely) have to do multiple roles, or at the very least work with someone that is doing multiple roles. As an example your product guy might also be your project manager, and going working with sales as an ""evangelist"" so you may get limited specifications. That said - you should have a very clear vision of what the product you are trying to build is for. That what, and the why. So you may have a lot more autonomy in the how left up to you.  Also, the senior title is meaningless. 15 person start ups have 9 VP's and everyone else is senior ;)  Start ups worth their salt are a lifestyle more than a job. If you have the energy and really dig what they are doing it can be *transformative* or it can destroy you from the inside out.   (went from giant corp to start up, now on my 4th... LMK if you want additional thoughts.)#I'm about to make a switch to a new company without increasing my salary. The reason I'm making the move is that I feel like I'm no longer learning as much as I want to and I think I will be able to learn a lot at the new company. So I'm not gonna increase my salary with this switch, but hopefully it will make me a better developer so that I can cash in further down the line.#Mixed feelings as someone who has done it.  It's a lot more satisfying to work but the nagging feeling of whether the company will be around in the next 6 months gets annoying.  Also my general advice is to consider the stock options to be worthless.  Don't make any decision based on them#You learn different things at a startup versus a big company. At a startup, you'll learn to be a generalist--you'll have to know how to do a little bit of everything because there's no one else there to do it otherwise. You'll also have bigger say in design decisions and your code will def ship.   At a big company, you'll learn more about good practices. There will probably also be a lot of structure in place, so you'll get a good sense of how the software dev cycle should work. There will always be someone to learn from and you have the freedom to be a specialist. "

Right now we're doing USL/LSL monitoring, but the goal is to capture multi-dimensional outliers and anomalous sequences that nonetheless may be within the normal bounds. The data consists of time-series measurements from T=0 to T=Tmax over a machine cycle, where Tmax is not guaranteed to be consistent from cycle to cycle. The sample period is fairly regular, but some data may be missing.Time (ms) | V1 | V2 | ... | P1 | P2 | ...----------|----|----|-----|----|----|----2 | 0.4 | 0.8 | ... | NULL | NULL | ...101 | 0.6 | 1.1 | ... | 0.5 | 0.6 | ...199 | 0.9 | NULL | ... | 0.5 | 0.64 | ...... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... Tmax | V1(Tmax) | V2(Tmax) | ... | P1(Tmax) | P2(Tmax)I've spent the past few days taking a deep dive into machine learning literature, and I think I have an understanding of the high-level steps I need to take, but the sheer variety of approaches for each step is a little overwhelming. Right now, my concerns are mainly focused around two steps:1\. Transform time-series data into point-space data  * It appears that there are a variety of methods here: DFT, LSSA, wavelet decomposition, polynomial regression, etc. I know that the best way to choose is to evaluate performance against actual data, but is there a recommended ""standard"" method to start with?      * How is correlation between decomposed vectors usually handled? For example, if take a matrix of 3-dimensions x 10000 samples, and decompose each dimension into 20 frequency components, so that the transformed data is a single 60-dimensional vector, is there anything special that needs to be done to account for the fact that each group of 20 dimensions isn't independent?      * How should Tmax be handled? Should it be included as its own dimension? If so, how should it be weighted against the other dimensions?2\. Identify outliers, and most-significant dimensions  * From what I can tell, two major approaches seem to be Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and Isolation Forests  * I have three reservations about the LOF method 1) some sort of dimensionality reduction will be required to avoid the ""curse of dimensionality"". I found a paper on the PINN method [1], which seems promising, but there don't seem to be any implementations that I can find 2) some sort of normalisation will be required to prevent the axis scale from dominating distance calculations, but how do I evaluate what counts as ""dominating""? 3) The LOF seems to be highly dependent on the distance metric chosen. Most implentations seem to use Euclidean distance. However, if spectral analysis is performed in step 1, is Euclidean distance an accurate distance metric in the frequency domain? Is it worth looking for an implentation that uses log-spectral distance?  * From my limited understanding, the two major advantages of isolation forests are that 1) they have a certain degree of scale invariance because they don't use a distance metric for classification and 2) they have dimensionality reduction ""built-in"" because each tree is constructed from a random sample of dimensions. Is this an accurate characterisation?  * The largest challenge that I see is identification of which dimensions contributed the most to a datum being considered an outlier. This seems like it potentially would be easier with the LOF method (do an O(n) search in the k-neighborhood of an outlier, projecting each n-vector into (n-1) space and rank dimensions based on which causes the greatest change to the LOF score), but the couple of tools that I've found so far don't support this out-of-the-box. I'm not sure how to even approach this problem with the isolation forest method, which is why I'm still considering LOF as an option.    I'm also having trouble finding any literature on this problem. The closest I've found is [2], which only discusses anomalies in sequences of discrete symbols. I know it's possible to map continuous data to symbolic data [3], but I'm not sure how it would be applied to multi-dimensional data, or how the performance compares to LOF or isolation forests.  * Another random thought I had was using either an N-order Markov Model, or an LSTM autoencoder/decoder to calculate the prediction error for each time step, but I am not sure how to account for the variable sampling intervals, the variable sequence length, or the continuous multivariate aspect of the data.If anyone could point me in the right direction for researching methods, or if anyone has any suggested implementations (I'm sure this is far from a unique problem), that would be very much appreciated. So far I've looked at scikit-learn and Jubatus. I know R is popular for data analysis, but I'm not familiar with the language or with its libraries. I know Amazon offers anomaly detection through [AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/sqlref/random-cut-forest.html), but I need something on-premise (besides the fact that it doesn't analyse which dimensions are anomalous).Sorry for the long post, but I had a bunch of related questions and didn't want to split them all up individually.**tl dr*** Doing outlier detection for high-dimensional time series data* What are current state-of-the-art methods for time-series compression/regression?* What are current state-of-the-art methods for outlier detection, including detecting which dimensions are anomalous?Thanks in advance.**Refs**1\.

A Symbolic Representation of Time Series, with Implications for Streaming Algorithms (Lin, Keogh, et al., 2003)";"Hi,  this is a really broad problem (as you've gathered), and I don't believe there is one best way to do this. I work in a similar field (environment sensors in buildings), so I can share some of my thoughts on the general approach.  Firstly and foremost: don't try to solve this problem in the general case immediately - try to break down the problem into subproblems which you can reasonably attempt to solve. Finding point outliers in high dimensional space is a different problem from finding arbitrary length subsequence outliers, and you probably will need to think hard about the problem domain to reduce the complexity in the latter case. It's also tempting to try to approach the problem in a context-agnostic fashion, avoiding the use of domain-specific knowledge such as the properties/behaviour of the sensors or physical systems to try to get a totally 'general' method - this is a way harder problem. For example, is there a natural periodicity or subsequence length in the data, such as daily cycles, that allows you to partition the stream into windows? This can make things much easier.  LOF models, either distance, density, or entropy based, all work pretty well (and similarly) in my opinion. As you noted, they're going to vary dramatically on the metric chosen, and will perform better or worse depending on the particular problem/data. This kinda illustrates another huge obstacle - how do you actually go about comparing different models or approaches? Without some kind of yardstick to actually assess your solution, you're stuck just manually investigating the data and results to see if it makes sense. I've found that there's no free lunch - there's no single algorithm which works best in all scenarios. It's a matter of qualifying the outcomes which are of greatest importance to the business, and designing against those criteria.  Identifying the dimension which contributes most to the outlier can be hard. If you're doing some kind of subspace embedding method, sometimes you can use the reconstruction error to determine along which dimensions the anomaly occurs. This works really well with something like an autoencoder/manifold embedding approach. Alternatively, with an isolation forest approach, you might interpret the output as a binary classification, and utilise something like [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) to construct a locally valid linear approximation to the decision surface to understand what factors contribute. I've only played with this a bit, but it seemed to look promising. There's also the 'brute force' approach of just scrambling input dimensions one by one and observing which has the greatest impact on the outlierness :) It's tricky in general because it's really hard to make sense of the results here. In some cases maybe you can visually understand why one particular sensor measurement is an outlier, but other times it's the whole joint distribution of the system which is in a low-probability state, and each individual sensor is regular-looking, so there's no way to really know.  As for LSTM autoencoder, this is a pretty dramatic leap in complexity from the other approaches, both from and engineering and computational resources point of view. You would probably need to choose a sequence length to partition the data over, and there are going to be tons of hyperparameters to more or less manually explore. I've found that tools like variational autoencoders *do* work extremely well here, but they are rather finicky, and slow (particularly for LSTM) relative to other approaches. One nice thing approach this approach is that you can continuously update the model as data streams in, giving you an 'online' solution. The current solution I use is a combination of a couple approaches - a VAE + an isolation forest + streaming KDE. You can use the reconstruction error of the vae to identify outliers, and sometimes you can do something like an LOF approach *in the latent space* of the VAE to help with this.    There's lots of literature on this topic, but in my experience, everybody just builds a solution which solves whatever problem they're working on best, making appropriate assumptions for their domain.   Sorry if this post seemed like a non-technical ramble. The TLDR is: there's no free lunch, try to isolate sub-problems which you can construct metrics to evaluate desirable business outcomes, and solve those problems first. Favour low-complexity solutions first over brittle sophisticated ones, until you can quantify the improvement they'd yield. It's better to get something into production that's 50% better than what you have currently in the near future than to labour for ages trying to get something like a variational LSTM working for uncertain gains.   Some papers which come to mind:  * [Literature Review of Anomaly/Novelty Detection](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~davidc/pubs/NDreview2014.pdf)  * [Variational Inference for On-line Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Time Series](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07109.pdf)  * [ICML 2016 Anomaly Detection Papers](https://sites.google.com/site/icmlworkshoponanomalydetection/accepted-papers)      #Interesting problem  As a baseline, you should test Time Series Discords, why?  1) Very competitive: ""..on 19 different publicly available data sets, comparing 9 different techniques (time series discords) is the best overall technique among all techniques. Chandola, Cheboli, and Vipin Kumar 2009""   2) Almost parameter free (just one parameter, the length of the subsequence), no tweaking or tuning.    3) They can be discovered very very fast, and incrementally maintained in streams.   4) Matlab code is available [a].

This sharing is purely my own initiative.Recently, I provided work for a startup which core team comprise of neuroscientists and engineers. The closest one I worked with published over 250 publications in areas relating to mental health. They developed a platform where you can use big data analytics to assess and manage brain and mental health disorders. What that means is, the platform analyzes many aspects of your 'being' - ie your blood type, your behaviour, your moods, your brainwave pattern, your facial recording, etc - and makes a personal assessment from there. If it detects something (it can even detect early-stage conditions, which is pretty cool imo), the AI advisor will give recommendations on what exactly to do. For example, if memory is worsened (early-stage dementia), it'll give brain training games. There are other recommendations in the platform. The platform is not ready yet and scheduled to be launched in July 2017. They are doing a crowdfunding campaign now. I won't share the link in case it's frowned upon here, but I do want to give this heads up to the community. You can PM me for their name though, I'll be happy to share privately.Have a good day y'all ;I've never seen a reputable neuroscience journal cite blood type, ethnicity or facial expressions as indicators of mental health issues. Are you sure this is legit? Is this FDA approved in the first place?

bigdata;5y1ind;1488904550.0;/r/bigdata/comments/5y1ind/request_for_architectural_advice_good_idea_to_use/;Request for architectural advice: Good idea to use streaming for a batch Spark application?;I'm working on a Spark-based Big Data system that is processing a lot of data, and this system is currently... imperfect. You request a bunch of data for a certain time period to be processed, it loads all of the data for that time period from HDFS into memory and then filters/processes it. If you ask for too much data (more than can fit into memory), then it crashes.I'm trying to change that. If a very long time period is requested, the system should break the job into smaller chunks so that it doesn't crash. Pretty simple so far. However, now people are talking about [unifying streaming and batch](https://www.datanami.com/2016/06/01/merging-batch-streaming-post-lambda-world/). This sounds a lot like what I need.I basically have two options: I could re-write the Spark job in a conventional way to load smaller chunks of data into RAM to be processed, or I could try to use Spark Streaming to do the batching. Should I use Spark Streaming in a circumstance like this? Or is the Spark Streaming technology not appropriate for this kind of application?Thanks for your help!;"[edited: formatting] I'm going to go with yes definitely - interestingly there's two different approaches you could take:  * Put the HDFS data into something like Kafka; the down side here is that you have a large movement of data * Put a reference to the HDFS data in Kafka and rely on the Spark Job to read it when processing  If you are going to use streaming, I would use the approach which leaves the HDFS data off the event channel.  As always, interested to see what other approaches could be taken.#Bottomline question is - can you actually shard or chunk your processing into independent units? If so, yes, streaming is great. But if you need to look at all the data, do aggregations and joins and what not on the entire dataset, then you cannot escape loading all of it into memory. You could do things like partitioning but that is about it."

He then moved to finance, where he helped build one of the most profitable hedge funds in the world (Renaissance Technologies Medallion Fund[1]), again using big data and artificial intelligence. He has now moved to the political sphere. Organizations acting on his behalf and utilizing big data have been implicated in influencing elections and referendums throughout the west, including Brexit and the 2016 US Presidential Election. They use big data collected from social media to create predictive models about what specific ad targeting will influence individual voters. From the article:   >These Facebook profiles – especially people’s “likes” – could be correlated across millions of others to produce uncannily accurate results. Michal Kosinski, the centre’s lead scientist, found that with knowledge of 150 likes, their model could predict someone’s personality better than their spouse. With 300, it understood you better than yourself. “Computers see us in a more robust way than we see ourselves,” says Kosinski.    1.

However you also mention that the syllabus for the 2 programs are basically the same.  This confuses me greatly and makes me think that someone who doesn't know the field named the programs.  Obviously, the course of study is what I would look at over the name, but if those are the types of things I wanted to study, I would absolutely prefer it to be named ""Data Science"".  Here is my take on the meanings of each:  Data Science:  That's high level analytics and making sense (including predictive) of data and information that you have or gather.  The courses listed certainly fit within that category. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science  Information Systems: That's the running of the servers and applications needed to keep the company running from a technology or computer perspective.  So setting up servers and making sure each user has Office installed appropriately and connected to the network to share information.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system#Every university will treat these subjects differently, but they are not the same.    Information systems is broad.  It looks at the ""systems"" in place to collect, process and distribute information/data.  This includes networking hardware, servers, databases, etc.    Data science is quite simply the study of data in all its forms this includes a lot of math (stats and such), information systems, databases, etc. The focus here would be on management and understanding data and how it is collected, structured and accessed.  It goes beyond IT use cases.  That being said, each university will allow the professor to cater the course to their strong suits and there is some overlap.  Also, many universities suck at creating pertinent IT courses that are relevant to the job market and often confuse courses.  So it's best to read the course description and syllabus carefully.  TL/DR:  Data science will have a strong math focus and primarily discuss the data in all its forms.  Information systems will talk about the IT systems that create, store, and serve data on a network.    "

We're a medium sized (~250 person) company located in midtown east (46th & 3rd) and have been around since 2000. I like to explain our product in the following way… Imagine Microsoft Excel (a tabular spreadsheet view of data). Put that in a web browser so we have something similar to Google Sheets. Now take 100 billion - 1 trillion rows of data, put them in a single spreadsheet, and maintain the ability to manipulate that data in real time. You can create new columns that are a function of other columns, filter and aggregate the data, run more advanced statistical analyses, visualize the data, or build a data driven web application. That's the Trillion Row Spreadsheet and it's the core product that the rest of our business is built around.Most of our server side code is written in k, which is a pretty cool language that I'm not going to discuss at length. k is an excellent tool for vector processing and distributed computing, but there are some tasks it's not well suited for, and that's where this job post becomes relevant. The Core Group at 1010data (the devs that build the product described above) includes the ""Interfacing Team"" which is responsible for two things. First, we solve the problems that k isn't well suited for. This consists of implementing some of the very high performance bits of the system that don't vectorize well, as well as integrating third party tools as to avoid reinvention of the wheel (we didn't feel the need to implement AES in k). Second, we build the code distributed to customers (k is interpreted, we generally don't like to distribute the interpreter). This code is (again) very performance sensitive, but also must be very portable (we've targeted Windows, Linux, OSX, AIX, and HP-UX to name a few targets). Put most simply, the Interfacing Team is responsible for the code that isn't written in k or JavaScript (though we do in fact do some k programming).So what are we looking for? We want someone with C/C++/other-manually-memory-managed-language programming experience who is interested in building high performance tools and libraries for manipulating big data. Generally we look favorably on people with STEM degrees, though there is some preference for people with a computer science background (you're going to be asked algorithm questions and for Big-O analyses during the interview process).  We have positions open at the entry level, though we certainly won't turn away those with deeper experience.If you're interested you can reach out to me directly, or apply via our [careers page](https://www.1010data.com/company/careers/open-positions/position/?id=599812). I am the hiring manager for the team (so I won't get any sort of bonus for applications through that link) but reaching out to me directly can skip some of the recruiting rigmarole.";

Author, Dr. Daniel Goleman, describes EI as being comprised of five key components:* Self-Regulation* Empathy* Social Skills* Motivation* Self AwarenessEmotional intelligence is an intangible in each of us. It affects how we manage behavior, navigate social complexities, and make personal decisions that achieve positive results. Individuals with a high level of EI are incredibly valued in businesses  people who demonstrate high EI make $28,000 more annually (on average) than their counterparts with low EI.Unlike your IQ which is fixed, your EI is something flexible which can be improved through continuous self-betterment with some effort.Let us examine how we can leverage the benefits of EI regarding dealing with our prospects, clients and even members of our communications teams.**Emotional Intelligence With Potential Customers**Chances are, everyone reading this has been on the receiving end of “spam”. If by some miracle you are unaware of the term, spam refers to unsolicited messages repeatedly sent to large groups of people, typically for the purpose of advertising. These messages usually have little or no relevance to the individual on the receiving end, making spam an annoyance to all, including the economy. In fact, it is estimated that spam emails cost businesses more than $20 billion per year.Then came the emergence of Big Data. Marketers were suddenly able to identify their target market’s interests, passions, buying preferences and so much more. It should have put an end to spam messaging. Digital messaging is slowly returning to its terrible roots. Due to poor practices by marketing professionals, more and more emails are being marked as spam and failing to reach prospects. There are some obvious reasons as to why this is occurring.**A) Listening Skills**A common mistake being made by marketers is their failure to hear. For example, a brand may have identified their target market and then quickly developed what they believe to be a perfect message to their recipient. But the marketing team did not pay attention to what their demographic was saying on social media platforms, for instance. It turns out their email marketing message completely misses the mark, and most of their prospects didn’t even open the email.To avoid this classic mistake, professional communications can benefit from Emotional Intelligence, particularly the pillars of Empathy and Social Skills. If this marketing team had paid attention to what their target audience was saying on social media channels before developing a message, they would have been able to understand the needs and wants of their prospects better.**B) Consent and Regulation**Another mistake often made when trying to attract potential clients is a tendency to abuse freely available data. It is worth remembering that when members of your target audience have no previous interaction with your brand, yet you go out of the way to get personal information on them, such as their email, the intent to solicit lacks consent. In other words, purchasing lists would be an example of this kind of behaviour, as would accessing their email off of an unrelated database. If you have access to the contact information of an individual and it feels wrong, chances are it is a bad choice.To avoid situations like this, marketers must remember the EI pillars of being self-aware and self-regulation. If you are not generating the leads you need, then perhaps it is time to rethink your brand’s marketing strategy. Instead of cold-emailing unqualified leads, try to introduce context. Imagine you work for a company that sells fancy cakes. One of your lead generation strategies is to send emails to people who visit a popular designer pastry website. The emails that you send are personalized and friendly and also include a recipe for a cake. As well, the email contains invitations to visit the website to learn more.In the example above, the people being emailed are already somewhat qualified (interested in high-quality pastries), so the email sent would not be cold and received with hostility. Your brand also offers the recipient value in the form of a free recipe which begins to establish a positive brand reputation as soon as the email is opened. Finally, the email includes an invitation to your brand’s website. This is your call to action, and it is the action that you want the recipient to take from the email.**C) The Pareto Principle**Emotional intelligence is used for far more than just digital targeting. Once you have attracted, a client is when EI arguably becomes the most useful. I am sure many of you have heard of the Pareto Principle – the theory that 80% of effects are caused by 20% of the causes. In marketing, this refers to 80% of your profits coming from 20% of your customers. This principle only serves to emphasize the importance of nurturing customer relationships using EI. Listening to your client’s needs and wants as well as empathizing with their struggles will ensure you will retain their business going into the future.Retaining customers is also cost effective. Studies have shown it costs five times more to attract a new customer than it does to keep an existing one, and only 13% of firms place on emphasis on acquisition versus customer retention. Utilizing EI in your strategy costs you nothing (beyond paying your emotionally intelligent team members more), and drastically improves the consumer’s Customer Experience.**Branding with Emotional Intelligence**One of the most powerful tools brands use is the ability to develop an emotional connection with their audience, and this can only be done with a high degree of emotional intelligence. As Douglas Van Praet, author of Unconscious Branding: How Neuroscience Can Empower (and Inspire) Marketing wrote, “The most startling truth is we don’t even think our way to logical solutions. We feel our way to reason. Emotions are the substrate, the base layer of neural circuitry underpinning even rational deliberation. Emotions don’t hinder decisions. They constitute the foundation on which they’re made!”This quote illustrates one of the critical components of consumer buying behaviour  People buy with their emotions, and brands know it. Their ultimate goal when marketing is to generate a positive brand image in the mind of the consumer. This is done through marketing campaigns using various advertising platforms. If one were to take a look at the most successful marketing campaigns from each year, it would be clear that high-performing strategies are the ones which use EI efficiently. Developing emotional advertisements and storytelling are two of the most crucial strategies in brand development.**Branding through Emotional Advertisements:**A study conducted by the University of Glasgow suggests humans have only four base emotions:* Happy* Sad* Afraid/Surprised* Angry/DisgustedIf we take a look at some of the most viewed advertisements over the last several years, there is a clear trend of companies trying to align their brand with at least one of these emotions. While it might seem obvious a brand wants to be seen as “happy,” this is not always the case. Clever EI used by marketers has allowed for the creation of some wide-appealing and effective advertisements.**“Sadvertising”**“Sadvertising” is a trend where brands create emotional ads which tug on the heartstrings of viewers. By implementing EI, these ads create a positive impression in the mind of consumers by humanizing the brand. In the President’s Choice advertisement we can see how what starts out as a bleak, somewhat depressing scene, eventually turns into a happy, loving affair. This transformation takes the viewer on a journey where a negative experience is avoided and is resolved positively which resonates well with audiences.**“Angratizing”**Ok, full confession, I made this word up. But it fits! Invoking outrage from your target audience may not be a conventional style of advertising, yet when done properly it can be incredibly efficient. Let’s look at Audi’s Super Bowl commercial from this year:Audi addresses the gender pay gap in this advertisement, trying to invoke anger from the viewer at this inequality. By the end of the ad, however, Audi brings it back to offer an optimistic vision of the future.As you can see from these examples, using emotions other than “happy” is advantageous in branding, but it is important to always bring the message back to an uplifting note. Brands do not want the last emotion their audience feels after watching a commercial to be a negative one, as this will lend itself to negative brand perception. It could even become a customer subconsciously opting for a competitor because they witnessed a sad brand advertisement that left them with a sad feeling. This underlines why emotional intelligence is so important in branding. If you are aware of what will emotionally resonate with your target audience, you will be able to use it to your brand’s advantage.**Brands Tell a Story**Storytelling is another emotionally intelligent strategy that brands use to interact with their audience. Essentially, brand storytelling is the process by which a brand takes a consumer on a complete journey with the end goal being a customer-brand connection. There are many different ways in which brands use EI for storytelling purposes, and we’ve written about it at length previously. Let’s look at a few emotionally intelligent brand storytelling examples.**Nike**Nike was the first to utilize the power of storytelling with their 1999 Michael Jordan Retirement commercial. The minute-long commercial shows various clips of Jordan’s career and ends with a picture of a young Michael Jordan with the Nike Swoosh in the bottom right corner.Instead of trying to sell a product, Nike sells the story of a man who went on to become a superstar. Nike’s brand, like in the commercial, is just an accessory to the story. By using the Self-Awareness pillar of EI, Nike puts themselves on the sidelines as their ads serve as the platform to tell athletic stories. The level of self-identification caused by the ad is a remarkable study in EI brand storytelling. Indeed, Nike has stuck with this strategy of having their brand take a backseat to the story, and it has paid off. Currently, Nike holds a larger share of the world’s shoe market (20%) than any other brand.**Airbnb**Airbnb revolutionized the hospitality industry, and it is also revolutionizing brand storytelling. Their content is focused solely on homeowners and the Airbnb customers who rent from them. The “stories” page is exactly what it sounds like  a place where users can document their adventures while using the service. These stories typically feature a small blog as well as videos produced by the Airbnb team.Similar to Nike’s approach, Airbnb allows the stories of these individuals to take centre stage while their logo sits off to the side somewhere. Airbnb uses EI to pick and choose which stories it wants to showcase. For obvious reasons only welcoming, friendly homeowners are shown, and they typically have a passion for meeting others. This lends a “welcoming” persona to the Airbnb brand.**EI in regards to interacting with team members**Being able to be emotionally intelligent with your clients and brand is a critical component of marketing. However, one of the most fundamentally crucial aspects of marketing is working together with your team as one cohesive unit. If there is a disconnect amongst your staff, then it will be next to impossible to do any effective marketing or be productive, at the least.Why is it so important to use EI with your coworkers? Your marketing team is the people that you see every day during the week, and if you aren’t getting along, then your best work is simply not getting done. By being self-aware, self-regulating, being empathetic and motivated, you will be able to operate harmoniously in a synergistic marketing environment.;

First off, be very skeptical of the accuracy of this model. It was designed exclusively by two theology professors with very little outside input. They also hand-picked the 15 factors that they thought would be important which is a fucking *terrible* way to design models. If those assumptions are wrong (and you have no way to tell if they are) then the models generated will be meaningless.  Finally, this is not in any sense ""big data.""

At one point they talk about using the number of charismatic individuals capable of starting a religion at some point in history (*how do they know that number?!*) but they never list a source or method of calculation.

I'm well versed in Excel and Google sheets just short of writing macros myself.  I'm also *okay* with SQL when pulling data but haven't any experience yet in overwriting data in DB (think pulls with JOINs).  I know just enough SQL to know what to search for on the internet to figure out how to get something done.  Other than that, I have a rudimentary knowledge of Python, HTML, and CSS.  To put it shortly, I've dabbled in a lot of things and want to lock down something for a long lasting career.This brings me to my question of what would /r/careerguidance do if they were in my shoes.  The reason why I've narrowed my prospects down to these three choices are as follows:* 1. Front-end web dev: Job market for this position is relatively high and although the learning curve is steep, I think I have potential to do pick this up fairly quickly.* 2. Analyst: While job searching for positions related to data and in the tech field short of engineering, I found that my current duties as an Ops Manager is geared more towards analytics (pulling metrics on operations) than actual day-to-day and roadmapping of operations.* 3. QA: This role is similar to the Analyst position (finding multiple bugs with new deployments then testing but never looking under the hood).* 4. IT: This is kind of a dark-horse candidate mainly because the industry, from my research, is more laid-out in the sense that the likelihood of certification X will land you in position Y is fairly high.Thanks!;"I've been in IT for a decade. I would just implore you to research diligently before giving it much consideration. The job market in IT is shrinking due to migration to cloud and automation; a few years ago I could find 30-40 IT jobs in my area at any given time and now I'm lucky to see one or two at any given time, when they do come up they're strictly end user support gigs.  I think that IT is a good gig to have right now if you can find a job, and maybe for the next ten years or so, but I definitely wouldn't expect it to be something going strong in 20 years or so.   The certification thing isn't, unfortunately, as clear as it seems. Many within the IT field despise certifications, and this extends to hiring managers many times. It can help, but the big thing is experience more than certifications. For anything but end user support: Employers, due to the dwindling job market, are looking for candidates who can demonstrate subject matter expertise across a variety of technologies, (Virtualization, Cloud, Networking, Server, DB, etc).   I guess the thing that I really want to impress upon you, in my attempt to be helpful, is that IT (like programming) isn't the way that it used to be, and the problem is that a lot of information on the internet is outdated. The data for today won't make it to the internet for a few years and by then it'll be outdated too. You used to be able to pull down a decent salary just being a Windows guy, or a Linux guy, but now to even be competitive for bad jobs you have got to know a lot about everything and it helps to have a mastery of something. In addition, these jobs often require that you have 24x7x365 availability and you typically have to abandon hopes of things like career advancement and pay increases. "

These days, we can discover almost every aspect of a consumer’s lifestyle and buying habits, and use this information to influence their purchasing decisions. With this wealth of information for sales and marketing, marketers should be able to form deep connections with potential customers with ease, right?Unfortunately, in many cases creating strong relationships is difficult. Despite having incredibly detailed information on their prospective buyers, many brands fail to connect with consumers. In fact, only one in three consumers believe their favourite brands truly understands them and only 35% think the emails or messages they receive are providing relevant and useful content.So where does the disconnect arise? Why are brands failing to understand their audience with all the data about customer behaviour, the marketing funnel, and demographic segmentation? One of the most obvious reasons is that brands neglect to understand the power of Emotional Intelligence (EI). In this article, we flesh out three compelling reasons, showing the how and why sales and marketing often miss the mark, forgetting a fundamental aspect of messaging that provides greater impact, resonance, and meaning.**What is Emotional Intelligence?**Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to be intelligent about your emotions, as well as the emotions of others. Author, Dr. Daniel Goleman, describes EI as being comprised of five key components:* Self-Regulation* Empathy* Social Skills* Motivation* Self AwarenessEmotional intelligence is an intangible in each of us. It affects how we manage behavior, navigate social complexities, and make personal decisions that achieve positive results. Individuals with a high level of EI are incredibly valued in businesses  people who demonstrate high EI make $28,000 more annually (on average) than their counterparts with low EI.Unlike your IQ which is fixed, your EI is something flexible which can be improved through continuous self-betterment with some effort.Let us examine how we can leverage the benefits of EI regarding dealing with our prospects, clients and even members of our communications teams.**Emotional Intelligence With Potential Customers**Chances are, everyone reading this has been on the receiving end of “spam”. If by some miracle you are unaware of the term, spam refers to unsolicited messages repeatedly sent to large groups of people, typically for the purpose of advertising. These messages usually have little or no relevance to the individual on the receiving end, making spam an annoyance to all, including the economy. In fact, it is estimated that spam emails cost businesses more than $20 billion per year.Then came the emergence of Big Data. Marketers were suddenly able to identify their target market’s interests, passions, buying preferences and so much more. It should have put an end to spam messaging. Digital messaging is slowly returning to its terrible roots. Due to poor practices by marketing professionals, more and more emails are being marked as spam and failing to reach prospects. There are some obvious reasons as to why this is occurring.**A) Listening Skills**A common mistake being made by marketers is their failure to hear. For example, a brand may have identified their target market and then quickly developed what they believe to be a perfect message to their recipient. But the marketing team did not pay attention to what their demographic was saying on social media platforms, for instance. It turns out their email marketing message completely misses the mark, and most of their prospects didn’t even open the email.To avoid this classic mistake, professional communications can benefit from Emotional Intelligence, particularly the pillars of Empathy and Social Skills. If this marketing team had paid attention to what their target audience was saying on social media channels before developing a message, they would have been able to understand the needs and wants of their prospects better.**B) Consent and Regulation**Another mistake often made when trying to attract potential clients is a tendency to abuse freely available data. It is worth remembering that when members of your target audience have no previous interaction with your brand, yet you go out of the way to get personal information on them, such as their email, the intent to solicit lacks consent. In other words, purchasing lists would be an example of this kind of behaviour, as would accessing their email off of an unrelated database. If you have access to the contact information of an individual and it feels wrong, chances are it is a bad choice.To avoid situations like this, marketers must remember the EI pillars of being self-aware and self-regulation. If you are not generating the leads you need, then perhaps it is time to rethink your brand’s marketing strategy. Instead of cold-emailing unqualified leads, try to introduce context. Imagine you work for a company that sells fancy cakes. One of your lead generation strategies is to send emails to people who visit a popular designer pastry website.

As well, the email contains invitations to visit the website to learn more.In the example above, the people being emailed are already somewhat qualified (interested in high-quality pastries), so the email sent would not be cold and received with hostility. Your brand also offers the recipient value in the form of a free recipe which begins to establish a positive brand reputation as soon as the email is opened. Finally, the email includes an invitation to your brand’s website. This is your call to action, and it is the action that you want the recipient to take from the email.**C) The Pareto Principle**Emotional intelligence is used for far more than just digital targeting. Once you have attracted, a client is when EI arguably becomes the most useful. I am sure many of you have heard of the Pareto Principle – the theory that 80% of effects are caused by 20% of the causes.

Listening to your client’s needs and wants as well as empathizing with their struggles will ensure you will retain their business going into the future.Retaining customers is also cost effective. Studies have shown it costs five times more to attract a new customer than it does to keep an existing one, and only 13% of firms place on emphasis on acquisition versus customer retention. Utilizing EI in your strategy costs you nothing (beyond paying your emotionally intelligent team members more), and drastically improves the consumer’s Customer Experience.**Branding with Emotional Intelligence**One of the most powerful tools brands use is the ability to develop an emotional connection with their audience, and this can only be done with a high degree of emotional intelligence. As Douglas Van Praet, author of Unconscious Branding: How Neuroscience Can Empower (and Inspire) Marketing wrote, “The most startling truth is we don’t even think our way to logical solutions. We feel our way to reason. Emotions are the substrate, the base layer of neural circuitry underpinning even rational deliberation. Emotions don’t hinder decisions. They constitute the foundation on which they’re made!”This quote illustrates one of the critical components of consumer buying behaviour  People buy with their emotions, and brands know it.

By the end of the ad, however, Audi brings it back to offer an optimistic vision of the future.As you can see from these examples, using emotions other than “happy” is advantageous in branding, but it is important to always bring the message back to an uplifting note. Brands do not want the last emotion their audience feels after watching a commercial to be a negative one, as this will lend itself to negative brand perception. It could even become a customer subconsciously opting for a competitor because they witnessed a sad brand advertisement that left them with a sad feeling. This underlines why emotional intelligence is so important in branding. If you are aware of what will emotionally resonate with your target audience, you will be able to use it to your brand’s advantage.**Brands Tell a Story**Storytelling is another emotionally intelligent strategy that brands use to interact with their audience. Essentially, brand storytelling is the process by which a brand takes a consumer on a complete journey with the end goal being a customer-brand connection. There are many different ways in which brands use EI for storytelling purposes, and we’ve written about it at length previously. Let’s look at a few emotionally intelligent brand storytelling examples.**Nike**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZSYD5OYSqc Nike was the first to utilize the power of storytelling with their 1999 Michael Jordan Retirement commercial. The minute-long commercial shows various clips of Jordan’s career and ends with a picture of a young Michael Jordan with the Nike Swoosh in the bottom right corner.Instead of trying to sell a product, Nike sells the story of a man who went on to become a superstar. Nike’s brand, like in the commercial, is just an accessory to the story. By using the Self-Awareness pillar of EI, Nike puts themselves on the sidelines as their ads serve as the platform to tell athletic stories. The level of self-identification caused by the ad is a remarkable study in EI brand storytelling. Indeed, Nike has stuck with this strategy of having their brand take a backseat to the story, and it has paid off. Currently, Nike holds a larger share of the world’s shoe market (20%) than any other brand.**Airbnb**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p884fFQL80Airbnb revolutionized the hospitality industry, and it is also revolutionizing brand storytelling. Their content is focused solely on homeowners and the Airbnb customers who rent from them. The “stories” page is exactly what it sounds like  a place where users can document their adventures while using the service. These stories typically feature a small blog as well as videos produced by the Airbnb team.Similar to Nike’s approach, Airbnb allows the stories of these individuals to take centre stage while their logo sits off to the side somewhere. Airbnb uses EI to pick and choose which stories it wants to showcase. For obvious reasons only welcoming, friendly homeowners are shown, and they typically have a passion for meeting others. This lends a “welcoming” persona to the Airbnb brand.EI in regards to interacting with team membersBeing able to be emotionally intelligent with your clients and brand is a critical component of marketing. However, one of the most fundamentally crucial aspects of marketing is working together with your team as one cohesive unit. If there is a disconnect amongst your staff, then it will be next to impossible to do any effective marketing or be productive, at the least.Why is it so important to use EI with your coworkers? Your marketing team is the people that you see every day during the week, and if you aren’t getting along, then your best work is simply not getting done. By being self-aware, self-regulating, being empathetic and motivated, you will be able to operate harmoniously in a synergistic marketing environment.If you like this article, read more here at https://www.photonicpr.com/emotional-intelligence-marketing/#.WLSolvkrJPZ Thanks for reading!;I think Spiritual Intelligence is by far the highest form of intelligence.

Need your opinion;"Let me share one quick winning from Yesterday, I saw a millennial going past my kiosk with ""DC Legends Comic book"" in his hand. I stopped him and started the conversation around the theme that our subscription TV service has tons of DC comics programs e.g. ""DC Legends of Tomorrow"", ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D"" etc. This teenager never had Pay TV, nor was he aware that we show these kinds of programs. His perception was shaped by his immediate family that Subscription TV means only sports and it’s always too expensive. Following were key attributes of that teenager:1. He is a gamer.2. Loves comic series.3. Hates sports.4. Live most of his life on Facebook and other social media.Upon further discovery, I found that he is totally madly and deeply in love with ""12 Monkeys - The movie by Bruce Willis"", so I immediately recommended him 12 monkey TV series and signed him up for Unlimited Broadband and Platinum HD.Following were key learnings for me:1. He rarely comes to the shopping center.2. Purchase most of the stuff even groceries online.3. Spend most of his time online.4. He never had Subscription TV however his perception was shaped negatively by his immediate surrounding.5. The process of stopping, discovery, recommendation etc. took more than an hour.6. I was lucky that I spotted him and manage to sign him up.The whole point which I am trying to make here is that right now our approach is ""Reactionary"", we are waiting for the potential customers to come to us so that we can serve them better or in more efficient manner however we are missing out a huge opportunity as Facebook has 15 Million Plus active users in Australia i.e. 63% of Population (http://www.socialmedianews.com.au/social-media-statistics-australia-january-2016/) and we need to devise a way to connect to these potential customers.""Big data analytics"" is the future, the whole notion of changing the perception of Subscription TV is meaningless unless we tailor our product to each and every customer (or potential customers). Remember WIIFM (What in it for me) principle still holds true however we are taking it to bigger scale (If every member of a household is finding something relevant out of Pay TV or any product then it will help the company in winning their business).Sales 2.0 unify a new culture of selling with optimized processes and next generation technology and it has revolutionized the way sales organizations benchmark and elevate sales performance. Turning sales from an ""Enigmatic"" art to a ""Precision"" and dramatically increasing revenue at a lower cost.Best in class sales organizations are already deploying sales 2.0 best practices to dramatically improve performance. They are focusing on the following metrics.    Increasing LTV (Lifetime value)    Decreasing CAC (Customer acquisition cost)    Increasing Volume    Increasing Velocity    Increasing predictability    Increasing scalabilityAs the traditional sales model crumbles, becomes untenably expensive, slow and unpredictable, it’s now essential that every sales organization adopt sales 2.0 and relentlessly focus on these 6 Essential metrics to remain competitive.";This isn't sales 2.0, what you are referring to is called marketing.

As an undergrad (junior) looking for data science roles, I was wondering if it makes any difference whether I join a team or not. On one hand, doing the analysis on my own makes me more familiar with the entire analysis and has me write it all.

I'd say it would be better to work on a team, both for your project now and for your future resume. In a work setting you probably won't have to ""do it all"" but will be party of a team whose members all have various strengths and weaknesses. Employers want to know that you work well with others and can contribute something to a work product.   Join the team and just try to be in charge of the part of the project that interests you most.

Get your foot in the door and then prove that your other skills are legitimate and that you are hungry to learn more and be given more responsibility.  Ideally I would look for a company with less than 200 employees.  You have plenty of time - experience will come! Once you are a couple years in you'll be able to flesh your resume out a bit more.  That being said I'd organize your resume as follow:  * Objective * Experience * Skills * Education  The content won't matter all that much at this time - just try and focus on more technical aspects and work your connections for an interview. Good luck!#We'd suggest removing the objective altogether and replacing it with a professional summary. Objectives are generally out of date on resumes now, as hiring managers can already surmise that you're looking for a position in their field. The summary is a much better route, because it gives you the space to provide potential employers with a rapid-fire explanation of who you are, what you do, and how well you do it. You can even tailor it to specific job listings, including specializations that align with the requirements they've posted for their position.   Your coursework section takes up a fairly large amount of space, which is why we're normally not inclined to include these types of sections, but given that you're an entry level college graduate, I can understand why you made this call. Our advice would be to reformat this so that it takes up less space, which will give you room to include an academic project section. This section will go a much longer way in helping you find a job or internships because rather than just listing coursework as an abstract list that you completed, you actually demonstrate your proficiency via academic projects because they provide an avenue for you to demonstrate your abilities through concrete actions.   While I realize that some of your work history probably isn't overly relevant to what you're looking to do now, it is absolutely unacceptable not to use bullet points. You want to open up each line with a hard past-tense verb, such as ""Managed"" ""Oversaw"" or in this case ""Conducted repairs"", and quantify your actions with hard numbers as much as possible."

I have a few general questions about what to expect upon graduation, and thought I'd see what you all had to say. Before I dive into those, I will roughly breakdown what we focused on in this program:3-4 classes where we focused on R. We learned several ways to to analyze data within R and talked about ways of integrating pertinent statistics to conduct the analysis.2 classes where we focused on SQL-- one was almost exclusively done in MySQL and the other was more of a big data class, where we learned about unstructured data (Hadoop).Several Marketing Analytics classes where we would look at predicting things like churn, probability of purchase, etc. We used tools like Google Analytics, SPSS, etc.There were a few other classes that were, more or less, a combination of the aforementioned classes. I have 3 years of work experience prior to joining this program, where I did IT work as well as Operations work. I did analytics (more descriptive than predictive) in the Operations roles and worked on a wide variety of things in IT (queries, hardware, analytics, etc.) My questions: What would one reasonably expect to earn upon completion of this masters? I've done some research, and it's far from conclusive, but the best number I can seem to come up with is an average of $69,000 (so I've been using this as my benchmark). I have an offer on the table for roughly $62,000. I'm also currently in an internship, but have yet to have a discussion with managers regarding potential employment upon graduation. I really like this company-- should I tell them I have an offer on the table and that, while I understand they may not be able to make an offer right now, I need to get some sort of understanding of what my outlook with them is?This may be the wrong place to post this (if so, any suggestions for a more relevant sub would be appreciated). If there is any more information I can provide to clarify, please, let me know.Thanks CS Career Community! ;What is the city?

We're a medium sized (~250 person) company based in NYC and have been around since 2000. I like to explain our product in the following way… Imagine Microsoft Excel (a tabular spreadsheet view of data). Put that in a web browser so we have something similar to Google Sheets. Now take 100 billion - 1 trillion rows of data, put them in a single spreadsheet, and maintain the ability to manipulate that data in real time. You can create new columns that are a function of other columns, filter and aggregate the data, run more advanced statistical analyses, visualize the data, or build a data driven web application. That's the Trillion Row Spreadsheet and it's the core product that the rest of our business is built around. Most of our server side code is written in k, which is a pretty cool language that I'm not going to discuss at length. k is an excellent tool for vector processing and distributed computing, but there are some tasks it's not well suited for, and that's where this job post becomes relevant. The Core Group at 1010data (the devs that build the product described above) includes the ""Interfacing Team"" which is responsible for two things. First, we solve the problems that k isn't well suited for. This consists of implementing some of the very high performance bits of the system that don't vectorize well, as well as integrating third party tools as to avoid reinvention of the wheel (we didn't feel the need to implement AES in k). Second, we build the code distributed to customers (k is interpreted, we generally don't like to distribute the interpreter). This code is (again) very performance sensitive, but also must be very portable (we've targeted Windows, Linux, OSX, AIX, and HP-UX to name a few targets). Put most simply, the Interfacing Team is responsible for the code that isn't written in k or JavaScript (though we do in fact do some k programming).So what are we looking for? We want someone with C/C++/other-manually-memory-managed-language programming experience who is interested in building high performance tools and libraries for manipulating big data. Generally we look favorably on people with STEM degrees, though there is some preference for people with a computer science background (you're going to be asked algorithm questions and for Big-O analyses during the interview process).  We have positions open at the entry level, though we certainly won't turn away those with deeper experience.If you're interested you can reach out to me directly, or apply via our [careers page](https://www.1010data.com/company/careers/open-positions/position/?id=599812). I am the hiring manager for the team (so I won't get any sort of bonus for applications through that link) but reaching out to me directly can skip some of the recruiting rigmarole. Note that this position is on-site so you'd have to live in or at least within a reasonable distance of New York City.";

techsupport;5yirn3;1489104019.0;/r/techsupport/comments/5yirn3/hard_drives_not_correctly_recognized_in_dell/;Hard Drives not correctly recognized in Dell 790MT Tower;"Hi guys, I purchased a Dell 790MT tower earlier this year to use as a cheap file server. The plan: 2x3TB HDD's in RAID 1 for data protection, 2x500GB HDD's in hot swap cages to move data quickly if necessary, and a 120gb SSD boot drive. I also purchased a cheap raid card just to get some more SATA ports (specifically this guy http://www.ebay.com/itm/161225040708?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT).So here's what I did:1. Install SSD and raid card, SSD is is connected to Mobo, install windows and set up services. 2. Install RAID drives and setup software RAID in Windows3. Install Hot swap cages and drivesThis started are really well. The system correctly recognized the RAM and SSD that I had put in and imaged perfectly. I did Windows Updates and updated drivers and the BIOS from Dell Command with no issues. The system with just an SSD works perfectly. Step 2 is where I ran into my issue. I initially installed my two big data drives on the motherboard because I was going to use software RAID instead of hardware RAID. After installing them and booting to the BIOS I noticed that the there were three hard drives listed in boot devices, but all three of them listed the same exact data drive. Both of the 3tb drives are the same but the serials should be slightly different, and the SSD didn't even show up. When I tried to boot, I kept getting a ""No boot device found"" error. If I try to boot from a device manually instead of relying on the boot devices in the BIOS, I can usually boot to Windows (80%+ success rate). I've tried removing the RAID card, and using the two smaller drives but that shows the same issue. I've tried a lot of other combinations of hardware like just using the RAID card and only using one data drive, but it seems like this system is just really picky. The RAID card seems to work perfectly, when I plug drives into it I can see each one in the card's software and setup RAID that way however I still get the same boot problem. Currently the BIOS is setup in legacy boot but I haven't tried to setup the system with UEFI because I don't think that will solve the issue. This is extremely confusing for me because I have done a lot of tech support in the past so I know how to thoroughly troubleshoot a system and this just doesn't make any sense because I can't figure out if this is a hardware issue or a software issue. Is anyone aware of a software/hardware issue with this desktop or has anyone seen this problem and been able to resolve it? In addition if you have any ideas I'd be more than happy to try them. It just gets annoying when I can't restart my computer when I'm not right in front of it.Thanks all! ";Is there a setting in the BIOS for boot order? You want to be sure that the raid card isn't the boot device

But.. from reading reviews online it seems to be a hard case to build in, especially for a newbie, so I'm wondering if it's the best choice (although I wouldn't mind the challenge). I also looked at the Corsair 270R which is also sleek'ish but more traditional and seems easy to build in... so any opinions on the matter would be great. - Concerning the motherboard, I don't really know much about motherboards and what to pay attention to, so suggestions would be welcome. I don't need anything fancy but would it make sense to buy one with Wifi, instead of the stand alone? Also, would it make sense to buy one which is capable of overclocking (what is the price difference?) so that in case I do need more power at some point I can swap the CPU and cooler and am good to go? ";"1.) i5 + 480 is one of the best combo's out there. Everything looks to be compatible and you haven't made the same motherboard mistake that I see time and time again with Kabylake.  2.) PSU is underpowered. As is, you're at 75% load, which is just on the edge of red. It'll work, but your PSU won't last as long(and by that, I mean as long as it normally should. It'll burn out a bit faster, but still last a few years). Getting a 550w would be better, but a 600-650w would be perfect. For the same price, you can get a semi-modular CXm 750w, which, while ""officially"" Tier IV, would probably be closer to Tier III or maybe even Tier II, just like the Seasonic.   3.) You're going to struggle no matter what with the case when building (they pretty much all have at least 1 tricky thing about them). That being said, it's going to be infinitely easier to build in a mid-tower case than it is to build in an mATX mini-tower.  4.) Motherboard is good, you seem to be one of the few people who actually picked the right motherboard for a Kabylake CPU (250 or 270) The wifi thing is up to you, a card will probably be just as good, if not, better than onboard unless your willing to spend a decent amount on a mobo. Cheapest compatible mobo I found with onboard wifi is €121.38...you're paying €100 for essentially the same thing. With overclocking, the Z270 is more expensive than a 250; the same goes for the locked vs unlocked CPU's. The i5 is weird in that it's good to have overclock potential since you could encounter things that it may struggle with...you probably won't find much that a locked i7-7700 can't tackle, but the same can't be said for an i5. For a light overclock, you will end up spending money on an aftermarket cooler (either the 212 Evo or the H7, preferable the H7, but I'm not sure if it's available in Germany. Heavier overclocks require better, more expensive coolers), so by the end, you're probably looking at another €100 or so to tack onto your build for overclocking."

careeradvice;5z3fb2;1489384106.0;/r/careeradvice/comments/5z3fb2/frontend_web_dev_analyst_it_or_qa/;Front-end Web Dev, Analyst, IT, or QA?;I'm a bit at a crossroads right now and would like some advice from a third party on how they would proceed given my situation.Scenario:Currently working as a Ops Manager for a big data company but I don't come from a CS or technical background.  I'm well versed in Excel and Google sheets just short of writing macros myself.  I'm also *okay* with SQL when pulling data but haven't any experience yet in overwriting data in DB (think pulls with JOINs).  I know just enough SQL to know what to search for on the internet to figure out how to get something done.  Other than that, I have a rudimentary knowledge of Python, HTML, and CSS.  To put it shortly, I've dabbled in a lot of things and want to lock down something for a long lasting career.This brings me to my question of what would /r/careeradvice do if they were in my shoes.  The reason why I've narrowed my prospects down to these three choices are as follows:* 1. Front-end web dev: Job market for this position is relatively high and although the learning curve is steep, I think I have potential to do pick this up fairly quickly.* 2. Analyst: While job searching for positions related to data and in the tech field short of engineering, I found that my current duties as an Ops Manager is geared more towards analytics (pulling metrics on operations) than actual day-to-day and roadmapping of operations.* 3. QA: This role is similar to the Analyst position (finding multiple bugs with new deployments then testing but never looking under the hood).* 4. IT: This is kind of a dark-horse candidate mainly because the industry, from my research, is more laid-out in the sense that the likelihood of certification X will land you in position Y is fairly high.Thanks!;

We're a medium sized (~250 person) company located in midtown east (46th & 3rd) and have been around since 2000. I like to explain our product in the following way… Imagine Microsoft Excel (a tabular spreadsheet view of data). Put that in a web browser so we have something similar to Google Sheets. Now take 100 billion - 1 trillion rows of data, put them in a single spreadsheet, and maintain the ability to manipulate that data in real time. You can create new columns that are a function of other columns, filter and aggregate the data, run more advanced statistical analyses, visualize the data, or build a data driven web application. That's the Trillion Row Spreadsheet and it's the core product that the rest of our business is built around.Most of our server side code is written in k, which is a pretty cool language that I'm not going to discuss at length. k is an excellent tool for vector processing and distributed computing, but there are some tasks it's not well suited for, and that's where this job post becomes relevant. The Core Group at 1010data (the devs that build the product described above) includes the ""Interfacing Team"" which is responsible for two things. First, we solve the problems that k isn't well suited for. This consists of implementing some of the very high performance bits of the system that don't vectorize well, as well as integrating third party tools as to avoid reinvention of the wheel (we didn't feel the need to implement AES in k). Second, we build the code distributed to customers (k is interpreted, we generally don't like to distribute the interpreter). This code is (again) very performance sensitive, but also must be very portable (we've targeted Windows, Linux, OSX, AIX, and HP-UX to name a few targets). Put most simply, the Interfacing Team is responsible for the code that isn't written in k or JavaScript (though we do in fact do some k programming).So what are we looking for? We want someone with C/C++/other-manually-memory-managed-language programming experience who is interested in building high performance tools and libraries for manipulating big data. Generally we look favorably on people with STEM degrees, though there is some preference for people with a computer science background (you're going to be asked algorithm questions and for Big-O analyses during the interview process).  We have positions open at the entry level, though we certainly won't turn away those with deeper experience.If you're interested you can reach out to me directly, or apply via our [careers page](https://www.1010data.com/company/careers/open-positions/position/?id=599812). I am the hiring manager for the team (so I won't get any sort of bonus for applications through that link) but reaching out to me directly can skip some of the recruiting rigmarole.";[deleted]

Incidentally, these concepts have been taught in global elite b-schools for decades. So, how come Analytics, which has been there in practice for decades experience a meteoric rise suddenly? To answer this question, we need to get the Big Picture. Given below are key factors that led to huge buzz around analytics today.•	Proliferation of Data Sources – Every day we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. This comes from digital footprints left on social media platforms, IoT sensors, wearables, transactions to name a few. Interesting fact is that only 1% of data collected is ever analyzed. To put into perspective all that innovation and insights driven by analytics are from analyzing just 1% of the data collected globally.•	Change in Customers’ expectations – Today connected customers expect personalized service on-demand based on their digital journey and personal preferences anytime, anywhere and on any device. Google’s context-aware search engine results, AI powered personal assistants from Google and Apple, Amazon’s recommendation engine have all made today’s unforgiving connected customers to expect the same level of customer experience from all brands they interact with.•	“Race to Zero” by Cloud Computing giants – The cloud computing price war between Amazon’s AWS, Google and Microsoft dubbed “race to zero” is well known. By late 2016, AWS has already made 52 price reductions and more price cuts are expected. •	Advent of Hadoop – Hadoop, open source distributed filesystem with framework for data analysis and transformation with high fault tolerance and reliability has broken barriers to entry for start-ups and significant cost reductions for enterprises like Yahoo Inc., whose Hadoop clusters span 40,000 servers. •	Every company is a technology company – Today every company is a technology company. One prominent example is how Domino’s is turning more into a digital e-commerce player from a traditional quick service restaurant through its Domino’s AnyWare program. As part of the program Domino’s collects data from 85,000 different customer touchpoints, to derive insights and drive growth. As a result, Domino’s was able to process about 55% of its orders online.•	Urge to join the ‘Big Data Analytics’ bandwagon – Media is inundated with Analysts reports with impressive projected and actual CAGR of Big Data Analytics investment, and reports on how data-driven insights helped enterprises solve real-life business problems and drive growth. This has pushed Top Management of many Enterprises to jump the Big Data Analytics bandwagon, before it’s too late.Open source distributed platform coupled with massively discounted storage & compute costs (cloud) have given Start-ups equal footing with Enterprises in developing and launching innovative products leveraging Big Data and Analytics, which was possible only by firms with deep pockets until few years ago. On the other hand, heightened customers’ expectations have led to the digital transformation of Enterprises that target to replace instincts-driven decisions with insights-driven decisions. Both trends driven by factors mentioned earlier have led to the explosive growth of Big Data Analytics witnessed today.About Us:At Noah Data, we help Start-ups, ISVs and Enterprises drive Digital Transformation.

I am planning on trying to do my best to convert the offer I select into a full-time position.(People don't seem to mention company names here..? is that a rule?) but here are the offers:---------------------------------------------------1. Card company that is everywhere you want to be - .NET Dev Intern for developing Authorize.NET apps2. Joint Venture between smallsoft and accent***. - Technical Consultant Intern (does both dev work and has exposure to new techs such as VR/AR/etc.)3. #BeMagenta telecommunications company - Big Data Analysis? (not sure, they said they have a clean slate... tons of data in the cloud, but don't know what to do with all this stuff so are hiring people to do things with it)---------------------------------------------------I definitely want to get my hands dirty and do a lot of coding myself, but I also want some exposure to a lot of the business aspects so that I can go up and above the dev team become a technical manager one day. Here are my questions:1. Which of the positions do you guys think will be the most helpful? 2. Has anyone interned at any of these companies before? If so, any information is welcome!3. If I don't end up getting a full-time position out of the internship, which would be the most helpful in the job search in the future?Thank you so much in advance, this sub has been tremendous in help during my effort to find an internship this year.EDIT: tbh, it's not actually a first job. I worked at a very popular korean electronics company as a web developer intern last summer as well.;I would take job #1.  I think your internships in college should be as technical as possible - you can always pick up business skills later, and they are not necessary right out of school unless you want to go straight into PM. Consulting in general is a lot more integration work, which I don't think is as valuable as pure dev experience.  In terms of the big data position - good big data projects don't start with no goal in sight. I personally am really wary of companies with the attitude you describe because it is the opposite of the goals-driven process you need to make big data useful. Also, you might end up just writing data pipelines/doing a lot of DB work.

I have a BE degree in Computer Science and Im fairly good at coding.So far being in the startup , I spent about 6 months doing some data analysis, random scripting on machine learning platform. Later from for about 4 months I worked on a .NET application(mainly GUI and testing) and finally I switched over to doing iOS applications. I love doing iOS applications and daily Im learning more and more(Swift is awesome!). However since Im leaving the company now, I want to join a bootcamp to clearly get my basics right in one field. Im torn between enrolling myself in a Big data Hadoop course or choose an iOS developer course. Big data , hadoop fascinates me and even though I have no experience I anticipate lot of challenges and learning to be done. Also the pay for a Big Data developer seems way more than a similarly placed mobile developer. ON the other hand, iOS development is something which Im familiar now. Im picking up at a good pace.My thoughts were, I could enroll myself in the Big Data hadoop course and pursue my iOS development as a side hobby.My question is,Considering the future demand, pay and general growth, which is the better direction for me?

I am very confused about personal evolution. I want to be a good programmer and i'm studying very hard. I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Machine Learning. We learnt C and Java in school for language. Also i have learnt C# for Unity. I was very excited about game development but i don't want to be game developer. But i don't have any idea of my own interested fields. School projects are very time consuming. How can I find a way to efficiently work for myself? What do i need to learn? I'm waiting for your recommendations. Thanks in advance.;

What are the seminal textbooks to get started on researching the topic and toolchains?;I don't know that there are any established standards (yet) in the space of data mining and big data.  There is a free PDF book called [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/book.pdf) that we used for my data mining course in school.  I don't know that it fits exactly what you are looking for based on your description, but you could look through some of it to get an idea of the general landscape.  It explores more of the ideas and algorithms behind data mining than any particular tools.  There is also the O'Reilly book [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) which may or may not be available as a PDF download by less than legal means.  As the name suggests, this book is more hands-on and practical and teaches the Python tools available for interacting with, manipulating, and visualizing data.  There are also a lot of MOOCs available.  I started the course called 'Introduction to Data Science in Python' on coursera.org but opted to spend some time with the Python for Data Analysis book first.

She's a terrible candidate. Everything else is just ancillary. It's like a drunk driving crash where the driver had a 2.5 blood alcohol level, and people are asking, ""was the stop sign not placed for optimum visibility?"" Or, ""was there glare off the road surface?""  When Bernie went to a state to campaign his numbers bounced by 10-20 percentage points in one week, and the more people were exposed to him, the more they liked him.  Clinton is the opposite. It was probably a strategic decision for her not to campaign actively, because the more exposure she gets, the more her numbers go down. People say, ""She should have gone to Wisconsin."" But with a candidate like Clinton, the conventional strategies don't work. You have to send surrogates like Bill or Bernie or Obama or Michelle. That's how much of a dud they had on their hands."

learnprogramming;5xc00i;1488565273.0;/r/learnprogramming/comments/5xc00i/choosing_a_data_course_for_a_new_career_path/;Choosing a Data Course for a New Career Path;Hey guys, I need help choosing between two graduate programs that last a semester and cover almost the same things.One is called “Big Data” and the other “Data Engineering”. As background: I’m a 24 years old and graduated in Business and Administration (called Commercial Engineering in Chile), and now I have a steady job analyzing copper exports. I’m not sure I’m doing what I really like, and programming is something that really interests me as a tool to improve my professional skills or (maybe) as a whole new career. Recently I discovered that there are some powerful programming languages that help analyse, present, and work really well with data. I have some basic programming knowledge in html, css, and JS (been doing some python recently). I think the data part of programming is really interesting, and believe it can be applied to almost anything. Since I know some basic concepts, and look forward to keep studying the next couple of months until the curse starts, I feel that I’m somewhat prepared to go into computer science and to specialize in that field of study. I'm kind of lacking some advanced math and statistics concepts, but I do have a really big interest in learning them.Being in this sub a lot, I’ve come to understand that it’s really important to learn the fundamentals and the theory behind this (and all other) CS concepts. That said, here are both graduate programs in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xWwDWniD3OaxMG0gbjE6oarGF0B4AwoabXFGf-AcNls/edit?usp=sharing). It would be of immense help if you guys could comment on this! Thanks for reading and helping me out!;

I don't know Yudkowsky's work enough to know if this is just a money grab or if he sincerely believes this, but it brings up an interesting idea. If AI is the next massive jump in societies evolution, I don't want to leave it in the hands of people like Mercer.

We're a medium sized (~250 person) company based in NYC and have been around since 2000. I like to explain our product in the following way… Imagine Microsoft Excel (a tabular spreadsheet view of data). Put that in a web browser so we have something similar to Google Sheets. Now take 100 billion - 1 trillion rows of data, put them in a single spreadsheet, and maintain the ability to manipulate that data in real time. You can create new columns that are a function of other columns, filter and aggregate the data, run more advanced statistical analyses, visualize the data, or build a data driven web application. That's the Trillion Row Spreadsheet and it's the core product that the rest of our business is built around. Most of our server side code is written in k, which is a pretty cool language that I'm not going to discuss at length. k is an excellent tool for vector processing and distributed computing, but there are some tasks it's not well suited for, and that's where this job post becomes relevant. The Core Group at 1010data (the devs that build the product described above) includes the ""Interfacing Team"" which is responsible for two things. First, we solve the problems that k isn't well suited for. This consists of implementing some of the very high performance bits of the system that don't vectorize well, as well as integrating third party tools as to avoid reinvention of the wheel (we didn't feel the need to implement AES in k). Second, we build the code distributed to customers (k is interpreted, we generally don't like to distribute the interpreter). This code is (again) very performance sensitive, but also must be very portable (we've targeted Windows, Linux, OSX, AIX, and HP-UX to name a few targets). Put most simply, the Interfacing Team is responsible for the code that isn't written in k or JavaScript (though we do in fact do some k programming).So what are we looking for? We want someone with C/C++/other-manually-memory-managed-language programming experience who is interested in building high performance tools and libraries for manipulating big data. Generally we look favorably on people with STEM degrees, though there is some preference for people with a computer science background (you're going to be asked algorithm questions and for Big-O analyses during the interview process).  We have positions open at the entry level, though we certainly won't turn away those with deeper experience.If you're interested you can reach out to me directly, or apply via our [careers page](https://www.1010data.com/company/careers/open-positions/position/?id=599812). I am the hiring manager for the team (so I won't get any sort of bonus for applications through that link) but reaching out to me directly can skip some of the recruiting rigmarole. Note that this position is on-site so you'd have to live in or at least within a reasonable distance of New York City.";
