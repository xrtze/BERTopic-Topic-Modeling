thinking here Don’t try spread FUD especially reliable privacy enhancing software Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence Show credible sources Most anonymity rather privacy Very cool post nonetheless I find hard take post seriously say Firefox copycat Chrome What fuck about You realise Tails uses Firefox right Please explain Firefox issue deleted No Firefox Even security Add ons Why Not trying argue I actually know why O thought pretty secure add ons BTW Excellent post A good post OP I slightly disagree For newbies I’d suggest keeping modest line identity convenience e g gmail account Google apps similar Apple Much convenience little risk Even gmail OK work colleagues etc A smart phone iPad useful left home turned off separated iCloud etc occasion What info share store anything would happy see front page daily newspaper photo name Add separate identity separate secure emails messaging non smart devices Less convenience privacy possible anonymity A password manager separate folders vaults required allows manufacture maintain two electronic identities Transition many logins passwords data secure environment logical fairly painless process Edit suggestions newbie low risk threat assessment Privacytools io best resource The best setup neebies firefox set private page ublock origin cookie autodelete privacybadger decentraleyes https everywhere Using password manager multiple emails multiple things Get rid google products use duckduckgo privacy oriented search engine tge site above Use open source software decentralised software encrypted chats like signal which best imho Other advanced things changing dns routing system apps browser tor using wired connections much can using linux distro using custom roms using burner phones using containers etc Yes let s use XMPP rather WhatsApp install browser Firefox Chromium Dude In bulleted list I d really recommend objective people perform actions In words information leaked What s specific threat mitigated Anyone interested learning visit r opsec well Title says first create threat model body post says almost nothing that best practices tools Create threat model nonsense ordinary people They specific threats specific info create model And supposed online experts tried help an ordinary person create threat model come empty Instead ordinary people encouraged learn use best practices reach level high cost low benefit decide stop Maybe judging benefit form evaluating validity threats But telling create threat model vacuum nonsense Also every comment post talking practices tools threat model In india can t get sim card without giving national identity card way finger prints bio identity data mention many companies like xiomi offers cheap hardware cost worst possible adware os asks imei code sent servers unlock bootloader hence must give imei numbers stored chinese numbers This trick might soon followed lot companies things look bleak here don t use Chrome derivatives copycats including Firefox Why implying Firefox derivative copycat Chrome Why saying browser like Chromium Firefox problem Both assertions wrong The latter one could sort wrong like Edward Snowden something that s pretty crazy level What browser would even suggest Tor Firefox extra stuff You save locally Tails USB creating persistent encrypted partition They incredibly easily GUI too not mention websites require use recaptcha whenever turn VPN Many apps require google play services I recently installed lineage os removed google stuff phone I can t make payment using phone payment apps require google play services Any tips this Good post man excellent points I really appreciate mentioning trade end something people leave lot Finally somebody talking threat models thanks post IMO people say claim nothing hide made realize even best case scenario nothing hide from people trust They might hesitate handing passwords partner whole different ballgame stranger This post lame What ppl supposed earn sites like upwork I think Netflix phone GPS kind deal breaker people though deleted Use adblocker device use Chrome derivatives copycats including Firefox I would argue people instead research browser use For example Brave chrome derivative seem pretty dedicated privacy Well shit apparently I keeping Brave browser privacy news And well too deleted So I supposed even know removed here In extreme case little difference Isn t there I meant privacy newbies context r privacy yeah Doesn t dismiss firefox copycat chrome then goes recommend pale moon firefox fork I ve used Firefox 18 years watched go full blown fucking polished turd dumping features made unique copying Chrome since 2011 dumbed user interface designed mobile touchscreens only memory hogging multiprocess If used Firefox circa 2002 08 there s way understand this See this reply consider Firefox either derivative copycat Firefox I m also confused this The possible privacy gripes I think disabled settings search engine defaults Google many countries collects crash reports default Firefox open source software generally takes privacy seriously including tracking protection private browsing mode Either way lumped together Chrome deleted This great list get started My post address confusion general privacy measures one take deal full blown surveillance many newbie posts seem assume former implies latter That I provided list suggestions sliding scale barest minimum full blown paranoia People individually assess stand tradeoff acceptable them But list excellent starting point Note whole comment nothing threat modeling title post Firefox addon called Multi Account container lets set something like facebook reddit always open container preventing reading cookies things containers Session better signal Signal uses phone number login proven hijack able Session Signal fork use phone numbers registrating Randomly generated usernames only I making case vast majority people blocking ads trackers combined careful post social media enough since Jason Bourne Edward Snowden sinister actors take unusual interest them I addressed benefit bulleted list There find lots people yelling first make threat model one actually able tell ordinary person who specific threats how it I think threat modeling nonsense ordinary people specific threats That kind person focus best practices instead making threat model Title says first create threat model Understand create If can t read title properly well They specific threats specific info create model And yet first thing land this post specifically response newcomers posting here general case full blown alarmism paranoia To put concisely bluntly one political activist journalist accessing internet censorship happy regime like China Russia one stop Is FBI Google Facebook online activities bullshit stick basics I ve already mentioned regard blocking ads trackers prudence social media Yes guides get virtual number burner SIM way universal Many countries restrictions well If talking Aadhaar get SIM without it You need something like driving license though which many states linked biometrics You actively encouraged provide Adhaar mandatory yet Jio I believe mandate Aadhaar sure whether still do Why implying Firefox derivative copycat Chrome If using Firefox since 2002 like I have see why I ve posted links repy another comment date shit started go great detail If first browser ever used Chrome expectations already ruined think contemporary Firefox amazing comparison Oh aware Then again still forced decrypt certain situations goes back threat model Cloudflare especially Royal pain butt They assume bot something No way unless there s functioning mobile website also offered addition app Amazon does example You course get opengapps flash separately restore minimal set Google components play store functionality and full bloat Gmail apps thanks Thank much utterly insightful valuable feedback Not Again sliding scale based much learn set much inconvenience find it I assume upwork lets bid contracted work do Basic level keep one browser Upwork related stuff Chrome care Use Pale Moon Firefox anything else regular browsing Or 2 separate computers use one work personal stuff Advanced level If enough RAM more 8 GB install virtual machine use work related stuff use virtual machine instance Yes hence I said one size fits all people need kind paranoia snooped either The extreme measures truly face extreme threats definitely average internet user You avoid using Google services default OS too No can t It s matter avoid using services Android components designed constantly track activity sensor information well provide apps request it And still expose fucking advertising Can t imagine kids today accustomed ads shoved front faces matter what addition creepily tracking showing ads based stuff spoke searched online Can share found Brave I use Websites work compatible Chrome Brave bs What s bad Brave Leaving points aside since Fedora beginner friendly distro Shouldn t Linux Mint Ubuntu Your post removed In new Reddit visible warning In old Reddit I m sure displayed user The point extreme case applies small set people mostly pissed powerful entities like governments megacorporations yet majority newcomers sub seem think facing similar threats Not fault even know fork means Firefox forked navigator component Mozilla Application Suite circa 2001 mean they re one now what interface privacy security I’ve used old days The world goes forward features used tiny fraction users Some features still here hidden Multiprocess improved speed stability browser Yes I remember old days With addons you’d every separate program built browser In single process And tabs Oh plugins I remember time stability whole thing getting worse worse I remember browser stopped crashing like crazy split plugins separate processes would crash leaving browser running info plugin page stopped working I don’t event want mention security implications running everything one process insecure Flash programs random sites running inside I don’t agree Mozilla’s decisions But world goes forward without decisions work unfortunate tradeoffs browser would already long dead forgotten Also options You’re gonna use chrome’s fork google stuff removed and perhaps shit added How better less chrome copycat Oh it’s copycat it’s chrome itself What else Internet Explorer Trident Opera old engine These experimental browsers barely render HTML structure Lynx Maybe bare cURL Exactly I think there s reason say Firefox Chrome I mean Firefox least allows turn analytics off And Firefox much better privacy Chrome Sure put Google default search engine that s Google users way tolerable since least Firefox give problems use Google xD unlike Chrome Long ago I set DuckDuckGo Chrome browser I never knew DuckDuckGo could give problems little bit searching I found Chrome apparently nasty stuff use Google You put well Thank you deleted How makes less secure In way Aren t least alerting threats Can elaborate In recent signal AMA said phone number feature soon changed Since brought up I’d say opinion subreddit bit biased negative experiences rightfully deserved You continue ignore basic instructions contradicting claiming “threat modeling isn’t useful” Even comment claim isn’t useful someone “no specific threats” Well would someone know “no specific threats” unless they’ve already threat modeled As community continues tell and continue willfully ignore process important even outcome may similar many people You don’t skip process think might similar outcome least actually care safety privacy survival etc As best practices elementary best practices apply most Beyond that “best practices” one person may illegal another introduce new skip existing attack surfaces didn’t consider because didn’t first attempt understand situation Opsec mindset— anti silver bullet anti careless pro self learning “Read guide you’ll safe” never serious solution privacy security “do specific workouts healthy” guide applied people varying health conditions completely ignoring physiology diet All quibble word You info create understand threat model justification ordinary person one go back talking basics tools practices threat modeling I’ve using Netscape Mozilla Firefox since 1995 whole post bad intro newbies turnoff subreddit what privacy got anything company copying another’s browser features I ve using FF since way Chrome never liked Chrome and hence never really used it I still know saying saying wrong i dont need add anything youve nailed it remind ill call wrench rule password secure able keep mouth shut someone s beating knees wrench actually kinda illuminates good theory security tho imo No problem nice day Sounds good deleted Tl dr They redirecting users entered binance a crypto exchange service binance link affiliate link Brave earn money recommending binance you This type redirection something see time reviews deal posts fact Brave without informing user shady af straight illegal Details here I m kinda torn findings On one hand fact redirect caught addressed immediately means system working privacy problems identified users addressed immediately Brave On hand fact Brave willing redirect URLs without user s knowledge really makes wonder stuff would willing order make money For me action represents stepping one foot slippery slope Hopefully try pull stuff knows Care explain I use Firefox real bad thing I ve heard brave injected affiliate links like choice turn good all ruin reputation browser Which post This entire thread happened asshole Mozilla wanted shut take criticism truth bombs supported evidence servers links I shared l33t powah usah interface clunky obtuse catering larger audience necessitates compromising privacy security duh s What nasty stuff Chrome use Google search I started using DuckDuckGo couple months ago see problems I wouldn’t say Firefox bad either terms privacy online anonymity isn’t greatest default If you’re using network filter start realize quickly often Firefox establishing outgoing connections Akamai technologies AWS various reasons one fingerprinting It captive portal about config changed enabled default enables Firefox automatically connect internet access portals like That said point Firefox lies privacy convenience spectrum acceptable most I need know also What wrong Firefox What s ghacks Do link deleted deleted I unaware this I ll use Session instead I went sub asked everyone anyone help create threat model You several others tried failed would someone know “no specific threats” unless they’ve already threat modeled So trying think threats constitutes creating threat model Seems bogus All generic threats apply 99 people I guess write one threat model including everything moderate level done it Then probably kind whose VCR blinked 12 00 90s leaving everything default never bothered customize Firefox heyday changes years post Australis mean shit you Because said browser a long history violating user privacy justifying you always turn off As anyone who s using said browser since 2002 attest starting shit around 2011 Using Firefox vanilla settings count Firefox used browser power users extensibility turn recommended less nerdy family friends All truly powerful useful extensions broke overnight deprecated XUL leaving us lame Web extension technology different Chrome does If never bothered use extensions beyond maybe adblock plus everyone had absolutely problem moronic touchscreen focused changes UI kept every release since Australis you know saying I assure memory would never less clear I getting beaten As I can t remember birthday I think mean this D If fresh start Android device log Google account shut Location services set Tor etc activities tracked There account track permissions given apps cookies track either Depends much trust Google respect settings track anyway I verified checking network traffic fresh device without logged Google account speaking myself I would rather control device depend promise company made it Also sign Google account can t use Play Store anyway point phone good custom ROM term unable use features However without default OS could use full device hardware encryption secure solutions e g Samsung Secure Folder You I use custom ROM minimal Play Services and root apps disable system components related advertising analytics addition firewall hosts based adblocking Besides Samsung last device I d recommend anyone looking root use custom ROMs anyway locked bootloader hardware based unlock detection me someone believes users full control devices paid good money for Thereby I d advise rooting phone means goodbye security Only idiots install unknown pirated apps shady 3rd party appstores even assuming said app knows phone rooted People root tend utter morons usually result malware authors cannot assume apps root access always Much easier fool average idiot granting app full set permissions pleases root access required I mean imagine reading entire post understanding core point every security measure meant everyone people understand average folk James Bond Jason Bourne government spying thus necessitating extreme measures listed Same In fact Brave first browser I suggest non techy relative switch since I can t go hardening everyone s Firefox As far I concerned Hardened Firefox Brave Firefox Chrome Yes entire post If I removed comment I would replied one comments No contact Mozilla I ve never direct contact anyone Mozilla point life outside tech support So that s level contact I Mozilla none I read post found made several claims Firefox among others source Your claim Firefox copycat Chrome example supported evidence cannot way regarded truth bomb I think things anymore DuckDuckGo automatically used become slower Chrome If start two different browsers Chrome other Chrome would load slower glitches like sometimes it d say could find server things But used like like year ago I changed Firefox everything became stable You probably find problems anymore Well ask op Not me deleted deleted To add this bunch extensions even privacy related allows canvas fingerprinting identify lot easily aren’t many people using specific extensions you gotta install mozilla recommended ones deleted Nah The link keep using leads non existent comment I never said know saying I m saying flat wrong say people know talking about The extension change annoyance justified reasons it As far I know main one better security general operability yes right forgot this someone else told referred comic forgot entirely XKCD always gets right deleted Stock Firefox way better brave Thanks The opposite case If cripple browser stuff understand browser end misbehaviour Attack surface reduction needs done browser level user side never works Use extension randomizes enough canvas attributes th prevent it Ehh easy haha I ve managed get couple over The rest still Whatsapp Facebook The 2 buddies followed Signal though hard convince Strange It response u MrBarryAllen9 worked well it Whether utter fiasco disabling everyone s extensions due expired certificate the rise cross browser malicious extensions courtesy switching Chrome compatible Webextensions This barely malware older extension technology begin with And course makes perfect sense make product compatible competition really important end users extension work across browsers If anything crashed marketshare high 35 2009 shown copying Chrome feature feature removing originally does If people wanted use Chrome need browser trying hard it But weigh much demand control device sake evading tracking ads I pretty much do someone using computers last 30 years but I tried raising concerns custom ROM secure measure nothing myth Speaking trusting Google question asked custom ROM creator Completely open source available inspection well known one like LineageOS unlike proprietary blobs phone s firmware Google s proprietary components It customization phone primarily full disk encryption still possible well anymore I even checked comment history must deletedbtw say dont use firefox I use btw say dont use firefox I use Pale Moon possible delete comment still visible original poster Here a screenshot And links referred to order thanks I look it I m saying wrong I knowledge counter argue points I must say part seem logical I problem recommending Pale Moon say Chrome chrome derivatives addition Firefox But recommending Firefox fork Why Chrome forks question addition Firefox Firefox forks ok A fork independent branch open source software based snapshot original software point time follows separate development path without affected changes original Chrome based browsers true forks internally depend Blink Google s browser engine They dependent whatever changes Google introduces example Google fully implements proposed manifest v3 restrictions tomorrow impact adblocking extensions affect every browser uses codebase Pale Moon first forked Firefox 29 introduced lame Australis UI set problems The internal XUL platform code forked Firefox 52 became clear Mozilla going get rid platform altogether Firefox s internal rendering engine called Gecko used be plenty Gecko based browsers past way Blink based ones now Pale Moon used based Gecko like rest till 2016 runs independent fork Gecko called Goanna developed path today So Pale Moon nothing common modern Firefox today Chrome based browsers directly use Blink rather independent forks it What asking would applicable anyone creating Firefox fork based code exists today earlier Thanks detailed reply I really appreciate that It makes sense now You re welcome It s crazy many people dismiss Pale Moon fork zero understanding term means A bit history Firefox forked Mozilla Application Suite circa 2001 It would ridiculous say product now

Ive following while knowledge desire write DD NLST Oh God like one OTC Webull take 😭😭😭 buying morning dip Good looks OP Great post I posted day less DD Think play nicely TLDR July 16th one stop long litigation route resolution dispute parties Consequently unlikely July 16th rocket ship catalyst date poster would like be If google appeals July date catalyst resolution gets kicked farther line If Google doesn t parties still prosecute case California take YEARS This rocket may eventually go Jupiter right even launchpad Ok that s exactly works July 16th unlikely major catalyst date Source I m lawyer practicing federal court working complex civil litigation I deal primarily multi state civil cases While original post seem largely re hash microcap daily article without merit The exhaustion appeal right undoubtedly good However important make distinction decision is isn t The U S Court Appeals ruling exhaustion Google s petition US Patent Appeal Board s USPAB original decision upholding Netlist s patent There companion case U S District Court Northern District California court ordered stay since 2010 pending resolution Google s petition USPAB This companion case case Netlist pursuing damages Google s infringement Netlist s patent Assuming original poster did either 1 Google appeal ruling U S Supreme Court USSC or 2 event google appeal USSC denies hear case next step Netlist file Motion California case court lift stay The facts indicate Netlist would likely win motion would able proceed case However order recover damages Netlist would still prosecute case win trial Alternatively Netlist could enter settlement agreement resolve matter part variety commercial transactions Google The problem is given fact U S Court Appeals s ruling still within appealable time frame fact case Northern California even entered discovery phase which alone could likely would take years likely see resolution matter 2020 Netlist can t even move reopen Northern Californian case Google s appeal rights exhausted Google opportunity respond motion judge issue order At minimum get order Motion Reopen take month So we re looking late August best California case reopened And even re opened parties looking years litigation Yes settlement acquisition or another type commercial transaction could happen time would reckless assume dispute anywhere near resolution Edit TLDR section 🙄 July 15th appeal Google CEO Hong left stay thing head court room jury would decide kind monetary amount pay 10 years infringement lied To judge using tech They opened servers bam 💥 got caught red handed Hence current court victory This also includes treble damages times 3 monetary amount Google likely want jury If google could even goto Supreme Court rule 36 makes unlikely loses again which will won’t look good company And I think don’t want SCOTUS deciding How much paid Most logical settlement licensing agreement A BO would nice that’ll give poison pill 6 56 I’d rather hope it’s settlement Where’s news 😫 I’ve little bit starting 32 since averaged 13k shares I’ll wait Good write up minus talk tendies lambos It looks like asking offering The Board believes proposed increase

Supreme Court I doubt would want that Read links I don’t see anything July 15th date Can point Yes said it’s available RH post They take settlement account sale bc competing offers tech companies guilty using pirated code majority shares still owned insiders offers must made known investigated My thoughts whole hostile take thing either full buy correct procedures gonna hell war hopefully til September take Supreme court route long one still pretty unlikely IMHO hopefully take account settlement buy that s brainer make cash Insiders majority shares hostile takeover option These types operations protect shit typically buy rights something researcher university setting grant money sit tech shows commercial products sue The researchers typically dont care patents property university theirs They already working different grant funded project anyway It s machine increase cost business definitely noble protecting ip instead chasing profits that s hilarious naive deleted What stop loss percent number setting Of course Actually see good potential Let’s see happens Maybe right maybe wrong I sunk lot 2018 nothing came it I m steering clear partly supported Robinhood anymore anyways best luck definitely that s wanted people look it best case scenario first come first served x200B Google definitely take makes way sense would buy feel like that s option number 2 Netlist unwilling take buy case another battle that looks NLST favors winning x200B penny stock Risk obviously high lets hope nice outcome Google also saves money buying company out owning patent avoiding penalties Ok don’t quote I think judge certain amount months come verdict motion filed There also possibility motion dismissed would prolong court case Not 100 tho So July 15th end correct I think right probably something good horizon here I think it’s likely google requests Supreme Court adds many weeks real answer here I’ll definitely keep eye out Yes unlikely SCOTUS takes case I think unlikely Google file writ TRY take case If filed would likely many weeks 4 6 find SCOTUS answer We know people impatient pennys I trust people dump learn month sweet tendies arrive My analysis people case If play solely 15th find good entry point either Monday Tuesday pull parachute starts increase dramatically 15th conversely starts falling drastically date You seem really nonchalant someone stands lose 70 investment thing tanks Let s see proof position right wrap head around that especially gave stuff PATENT guess want sadly x200B honestly GNUS touched 11 00 given buy settlement hope touch 25 00 x200B bad outcome get delayed still devalue holding change anything company dude i m gonna show account But really buy in wanted people lookout make watch list this high risk high reward scenario would never force people buy shit stock morals think made clear risk involved x200B look i m googles money i m fine tanks since i m holding anyways x200B yes stoploss 58c thanks tip though best luck you rly hope someone responds Looks like WeBull it I’ll see it’s actually buyable morning Well entirely different company Here suing SK Hynix thank replying me What’s exit strategy I get it Saw reply lot posts good There lot fake pump dump posts here Honestly I sold off I hope well didn’t seem like wouldn’t appeal A 30 day period reply Office means 30 calendar days including Saturdays Sundays federal holidays However period ends Saturday Sunday federal holiday reply timely filed next succeeding business day If period reply extended time extended added last calendar day original period opposed added day would due said last day Saturday Sunday federal holiday x200B im mistaken someone else confirm would great Is otc available Robinhood Why Robin hood popular Do awesome moneymarket something I hear bad things people talk robinhood facts surprised Microsoft tech giants involved making offers yet that s least likely scenario You understand things huh By things I mean bright Or it’s problem that’s solved engineers NLST worked diligently on read 2007 2010 rnd budget Then showed google WHO SIGN’s A NDA In Google decides it’s necessary pay company showed tech Leading multi year lawsuit google found guilty But it’s really open interpretation deleted then put watch list dude enter trade i dont blame tbh deleted Thank you And I wanted throw I’m selling department I don’t blame thanks input Hope good portfolio Let’s get it yes true case unlikely point time looks July date doubt ill extend august the judge 3 months give verdict July 15th 30 days since Google found guilty case them What exactly happen 15th unsure of Do reakon would dip 0 5 this can t word better myself Exactly These guys making shit up I’d love see someone show proof bought 20K shares never do i m going show personal stuff dude really buy wanted show something x200B fact check everything said really problem it x200B wanted people put watch list i m google money dudes 20K position You didn’t put rockets majority didn’t know looking words wrote OP probably remember log back alts Lol spare story takes 2 seconds take small screenshot position You conviction right So show us x200B i m fine tanks THIS important part whole thread y all Gotcha thanks yeah response smells like shit looks like shit shit The CEO sold massive amount shares judgement touch thing 10 foot pole im 79 think anything 70 probably safe IMHO Well post mentioned law suits I figured NerdG23 alluding mentioning good point They also suing google recently court declined googles defense 3 major points had Knowing google lawsuit drawn even appeals endless google cash To pump dump post probably Oh yeah definitely it’s actually becoming real issue took 3 new mods let’s see control influx new pumpersAnd thanks input I try clear much I Sometimes I don’t exact answer I encourage people DD rubric future DD That’s cool I’m high risk high reward scenario If pay it’s gonna good day not I’ll hold like nothing happened Gotcha that’s first link said second link get June 15th date The second link mention anything reply office I’ve ever used ameritrade I answers questions Sorry Hong stated Apple new client seems likely multiple offers table Either way sales must approved I honestly kinda think you’re pumping anything post Do know anything patent infringement law Because receive damages lost sales prove could’ve made sales yourself And I doubt NLST that The likely outcome court eventually assigns royalty future sales NLST won’t recover anything prior infringement money made Google others I know dick even try respond A hostile takeover someone attempts buy 50 shares open market That option insiders majority shares Being prick easier thinking facts I guess remember i m talking court ruling sell point would micro problem x200B put watch list feel like definitely interesting yeah true reason tripled price 15th 10 year patent war x200B put watch list don t jump Hmm true still pretty long hold Judges take time look case files could easily take 3 months And even google won’t immediately pay settlement could take another couple months right They’ll go entire negotiation process they’ll compensate NLST they’ll ready pay settlement could chunks especially they’re making billions decade I really want get In following weeks But I feel like right early tell I agree tho win court battle receive settlement stock go parabolic make millionaires Watch accounts anywhere found 16th I hope I m wrong seen pattern play lot especially recently since new traders entered game like said above play it wanted share i m google money dudes 20K position Why replying posts asking other people show us position To top off style writing accounts eerily similar well timing It s pretty clear see coordinated inorganic pump here Most y all next week guess that s reasonable explanation thought 3 enough end that s majority reads anyways lol look important part thread YOU DON T HAVE TO BUY IN x200B gave facts look DD know tolerate risk x200B seriously everyone comfortable sharing positions i m trying nice here x200B penny stock really think would risk free next Samsung risk involved fell comfortable there s plethora penny stocks market that s cool wanted share find nice day also never made people would jump made add watchlist hopefully DD What platform buy on Any idea webull longer letting buy shares sorry i ll fix right away I 6 brokerage accounts fun one brother Charles Schwab Hello brother can link twitter source would like add post x200B thanks advanced that s makes sad wanted share DD yes I ve asked lawyers possible outcomes less agreed upon scenarios x200B But really like saying buy stock means think risk reward taste definitely buy x200B forcing anyone people really invest since target google anyways random 20K shares I think see proving wont hard all It usually case something involving industry standard Bc Google persuading blackmailing large stock holders vote completely within realm circumstances I seem many positions do either stupid I m asshole My original statement outlining current situation would grounds investigation even board overthrown well that s definitely hopefully news breakout nice spike like first ride 2 00 able go settlement payments bet win buy flux institutional investors wanting piece pie x200B take buy everyone benefits Not talking specifically There’s people thread others always claim big plays always look like new pump accounts That’s funny I read whole thing skipped tldr didn’t notice three rockets there I never asked share positions I asked alt accounts You re one jumped it Let answer But good I hope investment made works you Just trying save people blindly diving you Like said THEY DON T HAVE TO BUY IN I m trying remind Thinkorswim Why CEO sell 1 million shares court I can t I worded differently No confirmation corroborating link I’m saying you’re “forcing” people dude don’t actually good reason think NLST getting multi billion dollar settlement that’s ignored comment thread asking question You pulled numbers ass Maybe But NLST hasn’t even patent infringement case yet They patent’s validity affirmed What describing hostile takeover The essence hostile takeover board approve takeover Bribing shareholders side acquisition unethical possibly illegal would still hostile takeover got Rockets less words next time lol 🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 we re i m trying tell buy in wanted show stock x200B find blindly jumping stupid 100 but literally say take screenshot position you’re weirdly aggressive lay red pills jesus homie Nice find dude Edit anyone else hear radio silence OP regarding concern 😂 Rumor among buyout ceos officials cannot carry shares It planned sell off Way court case rapped up The CEO pay lawyer fees expenses keep production He also handed notes oa handful companies 1 2 that also helped lawsuits With said note get x amount shares netlist sell certain price promissory note stock OP also failed mention google ruling another court case another company something Is hold google case done They want see google do selling like crazy It tanked today millions shares added float last days that s cool I ve heard I ve also heard rumor Google lawyers caught lying wanted post solely facts big backlash toward honestly feel like low balled numbers lot honestly due DD prove wrong ten fold That certainly true Semantics Did learn finance class alright good luck OP rushed defend it The alts nowhere found My initial question 2 random posters claiming 20K 35K shares But hey guess trust 19 day old account neutral observer right Lol good luck shilling Yeah danger written it Stock rises 20 average almost 90 multiple days news comes out The CEO selling shares I’m good lol Could true still owns 7 million shares I believe sold regularly past largest amount ever They re awarded cash shares new company They definitely need dump open market It s posted LinkedIn page now But I stand Hong comment But you’re basing Google made and haven’t given sources even determined that Your mistake you’re assuming settlement amount ballpark Google made infringing it That probably case It s semantics difference matters lot shareholders An attempted hostile takeover via acquisition open market shares would fantastic shareholders would drive price up either naturally directly tender offer you need weed I definitely see concerns maybe I clear up The reason went 20 almost 90 stated news op stated ruled netlists favor 3 0 It also considered rule 36 judgement Out 15 rule 36 judgments tried appeal Supreme Court zero accepted As CEO sell concern This Rule 10b5 1 lets insiders sell predetermined amount shares predetermined time To me insider trading Ohhhhh ok ok thanks heads up Right CEO still elected sell time wasn’t required to Thanks info though that’s good know writs denied rule 36 judgments
datascience;i0y3po;1596157097.0;/r/datascience/comments/i0y3po/how_big_is_big_data/;How big “big data ”;Admittedly “big data” phrase I hear mostly non data scientists trying impress people I’m curious someone tells work big data list skill resume imagine Terabytes Petabytes Exabytes Maybe it’s actual size use it example ability set spark cluster scale needed use tools like dask Just curious people’s opinion are—if term carries weight it’s another corporate buzz word;It s size data use it As long leave stakeholders feeling satisfied feel anyway insecure size When I started biz 80s gigabytes big data In 1992 I worked vendor large retailer Bentonville AR They system 1 2 TB time largest commerical data warehouse time It took something like 2400 disk drives 1 3 football field space floor Back 1 2 TB could considered Big Data Fast forward 10 15 years later retailer companies hitting Petabyte level data At time PB could considered big data Today companies 10s 100s PB data production systems whether RBDMS Hadoop based platforms The way I look big data much size type data used Daily sales store item day big data early 90s Then market basket data every scan item considered big data Now telemetry mobile phones IOT devices producing vast amounts data analzye That semi structured data text video types non traditional data sources contribute vast amount data collected today But storing big data end game Using understanding making decisions based analysis big data big data processing about A human cannot look billions rows data go Aha that s answer It meaningful analysis ultimately summarization big data set metrics humans advanced settings automation make decisions based metrics I hear many talk big data terms size The people know big data talk terms use Big data need specialized tools techniques deal it Typically means horizontal scaling parallelization multiple nodes many computers Vertical scaling beefier single computer easy need special tools techniques Commonly three V s important Volume Velocity VarietyAs volume currently fit 2TB memory 100TB storage single node quite lot compared 2002 100GB would big data causes problems In addition size velocity data problem without volume high With online data data discard time streaming data might couple hundred gigabytes time speed process bottleneck As get 92 CPU cores AWS single machine Quite lot compared 2 cores dual socket server 2002 Variety another one 100TB database might cause problems whatsoever database takes care everything use SQL If structured queries simple even 100GB become problem need heavy processing transformations them In book machine 64 core AMD EPYC processor 2TB ram 4 V100 GPU s 10TB disks storage big data If need is I ve seen people talk 800MB file crashes excel 32bit 2007 big data Anything larger process one computer big data deleted Anything fit comfortably modern computer good candidate big data I 2TB drive here can t imagine handling 1 2 T machine even would stretching it I think it’s issue data size also way approach problem The word big data usually accompanied prediction rather explanation allows researcher basically squeeze everything data interaction terms transformations polynomials etc without thinking much finding clear explanatory relationship outcome target dependent variable predictors covariates The aim usually give freedom scientist researcher terms features functional forms include equation From lasso svm random forest gbm nn see main aim prediction Question nowadays whether use powerful methods understand causal relationships Large enough needs processed distributed manner As I understand it big data data can t fit memory Big Data also family tools techniques dealing data distributed system although presence system usually data big fit analysts computer s memory There grey area might data that s big memory still use online chunking algorithms get piecemeal Pretty big If I remember VVV definition Volume big fit regular computerVelocity increasing updating quicklyVariety multiple data types In one classes professor defined data fit cannot processed single personal standard computer Yes still technically ambiguous lot defined I ever heard it Big Data means data easily process analyse current infrastructure Little cynical I around Teradata claimed Big Data environment It s really executive buzzword like Tiger Teaming What think Big Data today big tomorrow That IoT tsunami way In college I textbook titled “Too Big To Ignore” So I’m going that I deal cookie level ad server data impression level sets clients Because silod clients data manageable Typically hundreds GB TB size data stores quite painful run normal SQL queries against I d say want start running Spark jobs I think there s true definition it I define size data main one main challenges working it To honest I work data sets SMALL data set becomes main challenge Like sales rep 18 months sales belt low volume industry I m supposed tell characteristics define ideal customer provide sales strategy growing territory I m Bayes I d say data large enough needs processed cluster big data Today I working satellite lidar dataset required 1TB ram process can t PC As data engineer fintech I believe data least two four V s considered big data volume velocity variety veracity Data truly extreme volume velocity rare often purposefully procured producer systems own variety veracity issues may significant or least make better On hand data small volume velocity data comes literally everywhere whims zero controls influence side Worse fin I little margin error leads big trust issues I need kinds checks alarms computing resources must scaled out Therefore I believe high variety poor veracity data still big data I guess point big data mass data requires big effort provide business value Size determinant initially perhaps since daily run batch processing dominant but field matured expectations rose natural number determinants also grew Is data blue Is data binary Then big data Serious answer Big Data data can t fit single computer locally Medium Data things big single person reasonably view interpret When I hear term big data I assume people telling havent got data science experience That person data hustler I always vviewed dependent tech used Things like spark I think big data big work reasonable amount time personal computer Once start needing process train model distributed way big data I always get sense big data means scale data collected analysis done complex enough requires different regime consideration methods accomplish things data For example GMail version service could theoretically serve handful people save records relatively securely server keep basement Gmail hand multi redundant cloud service fixeed location stored data centers large require steady stream fresh hard drives keep going literally burn one matter hours Dealing requires logistics special programming methods special methods handling cryptosecurity managing clocks generating random numbers forth At least that s I think I hear people discussing big data whether they re talking not Affixing Big things order elevate importance pretty typical marketing double speak I friend oil prospecting industry regularly works PB data Some physics experiments I think large hadron collider generating 15 years ago The original definition big data data bigger fit single server I tend think “internet big” everything else Also there’s lot data “small” GB information intensive If hang ICD 10 code back healthcare record suddenly rich deep taxonomy sorts things with Specialist clinical audit data 1 000s records highly significant Not massive volumes “low quality” start “lower information density” In role data measured Megawatts To me it’s enough data can’t fit memory one machine use tools process parallel A definition I like The data big efficiently processed SQL database basically bigger able load whole dataset typical machine s memory 16 GB I d say much many data points number variables data types makes data big It majorly reference dataset huge data points complex structure Eg retail level data customer coming Tesco super market considering data past 2 years Datasmartness nice glib answer I heard too big work laptop My rule thumb if open Excel Big Data D A million rows That’s basically functional limit Microsoft excel Access start needing data sciencey tools Whatever doesn’t work excel As far I see it big data data set big enough considered highly dimensional allow machine learning performed In practice hundred observations thousand samples considered big data challenges arise analysis similar thousands observations samples Personally I work data TB scale usually millions samples thousands observations My impression main difference Big Data conventional data Big Data collected without knowing exactly later That s Big data rarely conveniently structured way need draw conclusions that s need special tools deal it x200B It s necessarily mainly dealing large quantities data dealing lot data that s relevant task extracting insights data meant provide collected x200B I m sure though personal impression plenty use cases sheer size data really main challenge It s relative environment If environment limited aspects resources e g credit card chip 1MB data big it lawful evil interpretation insprired deep neural nets dataset one one data point big data like NN one layer deep In average DAX Company big data begins 100 rows excel It s skills come along dealing data The libraries like spark comply requirements arise The term loosely defined data CSV format GB data compressed parquet format might reduce 90 There four V s Big Data Volume Velocity Veractiy Variety If data them even one tehcniques Big Data help address properties It s always Volume Velocity huge amount data coming fast It variety parse make uniform data disparate sources different formats It Veractiy data quesitonable sources needs introspection circumspect analysis results trusted BigData dataset fit Excel sheet I think mainly refers amount data size Like 50K images dog training classification model Or census data 1920 2020 could probably somewhere around 20B rows excel case possible big data That said much possible size 20B rows excel sheet smaller 50K dog images Provost Fawcett 2013 define Big Data data sets large traditional data processing systems therefore require new technologies The O’Reilly Radar definition Big Data situation size data becomes

Forum There hard and fast standards working rule thumb easily provision VM enough RAM fit entire data set probably big data That standard obviously change time right probably low terabytes You know realm big data start running serious technical limitations In practice I ve found many data scientists work small data a tens gigabytes fairly basic business analytics That s still enormously useful valuable thing do qualitatively different kind heavy lifting might need Hadoop ecosystem for I think difference too big fit main memory use something like spark efficiently process it accurate answer whatever business wants mean Big enough need cluster hortizontal scaling parallelization perform ETL processess meaningful timeframe This could huge files need processed daily overnight smaller files need processed instantly streaming There s set data size that s considered Big Data In fact one point back 90s 1 gigabyte considered big data can imagine However typical company small medium sized business market access nearly 200 terabytes data Usually businesses harnessing fraction create innovative advantages Some big data services include auditing existing data whether HR CRM etc make sure missed opportunities could leveraging data already have set new data collection points needed automate analysis big data analytics require constant effort monitoring rather often goes hand in hand artificial intelligence machine learningCertified Professional Data Engineers automate process data collection analysis setting data engineering pipelines directly get processed information instead go gigabytes data More info Data huge misnomer Let tell someone 20 years experience data engineer using SQL Databases Spark Hadoop NoSQL I got Hadoop Spark MongoDb side things short hype novelty I thought cool month I realized garbage tools 99 time Let s start data stored relational database Let s say I table one column only Sales contains 32 bit integer type Let s say I 10 billion records table number values averaging 1000000000 one billion How much space take Each number stored binary format takes 4 bytes 4 bytes x 10 billion 40 000 000 000 bytes 40 gb That s 40 gigs Now let s store number JSON format It contains metadata tag column Sales 1000000000 Since stored plain text record takes 19 bytes So table weighs 190 gigs already Queries response times suck single node big data servers answer problem horizontally scale data meaning make copies data across many servers needed gain better throughput parallel processing That s pretty much Hadoop does So let s assume we re going light 5 nodes That s 190x5 950 gigs We re almost terabyte territory already puny 40 gb dataset already taking almost terabyte storage big data system Keep mind quite 100 node Hadoop clusters there 100 nodes scenario 19 terabytes That s right 40 g 19 terabytes Now THAT s big data Many years ago I created data warehouse large credit card company weighed less 20 g yet contained records call volumes company worldwide I learned since moved Hadoop because according them manage several terabytes data exact application Now I know fact call volumes multiply factor millions extra data come from My guess extra data inefficiency So question is When big data appropriate use Let illustrate scenario If go Library Congress 16 million books interested reading books Michael Lewis go online terminal even card catalog look books author name find Michael Lewis it ll tell exactly go In less 3 minutes already browsing books If library double number books have would still take roughly time find books That s data storage SQL Database Now imagine instead library come across huge warehouse massive 16 million pile books center Not books newspapers lead pipes old shoes etc Now want find Michael Lewis books there Well could dig search book one one all would take years Instead hire 100 high school kids sort books you With 100 people 100 times faster If hire 200 kids even faster But even people it ll take days still that s nature work doing But really viable way finding books absence cataloging shelving system That s big data In scenarios above smart money moves data Hadoop SQL Database Like 200 kids organize books catalog you You that card catalog helps find books minutes again But I m seeing alot people dismantling library chucking books big pile keep hiring 200 kids find books need every time need it They decommission SQL databases move Hadoop Spark MongoDb suffer horrific response times result When numbers start measured illions Every single tweet world Too big fit excel spreadsheet Big data refers tools used volume data A big company huge SQL server database billions records big data A smaller company smaller volume data manager via Hadoop cluster big data More million rows Thanks That’s big relief This best comment history sub I love put mine model That’s said Do feel data analytics useful modern times combination random hodge podge data mobile web chat etc combined one old school method querying best selling items example I feel like former Dimensional reduction particularly useful big data visualization said human cannot look huge table guess relationship data Yet algorithms provide workaround generate lower dimensional representations make sense the relationship samples preserved PCA UMAP Good answer It sounds like age cloud computing it’s less much data handle efficiently needs done I ve seen people talk 800MB file crashes Excel 32bit 2007 big data Files big open save work pretty common scenario Poor processes software culprit instances An 800MB file challenge powerful desktop network systems manage volume definition A database table size ho hum shop routinely ingest process discrete files size I would call big data volume part definition I ve never seen desktop computer 2TB ram I doubt many single servers carry much ram If ask business analysts anything can t opened spreadsheet XD Agree this Big data usually pandas data frames don’t work well go big data framework like Spark work data But size big data ranges I described minimum threshold But difference big data ridiculously big data generating faster processed traditional infrastructure To me Big Data raw size dataset It s span it If data streaming sources world growing non stop could Big Data What mean blue Yeah that’s sort I feel An actual data scientist would probably say work spark Hadoop cloud environments etc It’s like someone Fintech saying work “big money” Uh no A million rows trivial unless ridiculous amount data column wise 15million 40 columns options start needing looked at A million break point Excel excel really joke comes examining things enterprise scale Unless talking velocity We project going ingesting incidents occur irregularly average 275k incidents hour factory floor monitoring Still I think it’s important able scale order comply restrictions may place back end But 20 Don t put there It harmful data size actually fit I feel like something he would say insecure his data size Lol Infact company name Q Blocks trying connect playstations crypto miners many computing devices build giant distributed supercomputerImagine kind innovation would possible could get big mega clusters fraction cloud cost today i like reasoning different tools required beyond certain size rapidly shifting landscape spark took hadoop hooplah dask rapids putting shame check 32 sticks 32GB dimms 2TB would 64GB dimms 32 slots I seen definitely enterprise level Do google image search big data Well yea obviously going columns lol When rows increase million I move sklearn spark modelling Its exact figure like 15milliom 40 columns anyway It rough estimate I personally feel Anything 1 million much higher magnitude I would use big data tools 275k hour irregular deleted Jesus hahaha Just tip I like go way overfit models 100 Doesn’t really work though it The point big data data is well big easy move around Clouds grids great fast interconnects Sending reams data edge nodes people’s living rooms doesn’t make much sense me Might make sense use compute intensive tasks smaller data Think SETI home protein folding simulations etc hahahaha The incidents constant frequency We look frequency time The system must still able accommodate them How many factories collecting data from Still doesnt qualify big data You right today’s standpointIt works best compute intensive tasks smaller datasetsBut looking developments fibre optics 5G adoptionThis distributed computing tech would become much feasible coming years That s good one I m gonna share colleagues Unless I m misunderstanding 275 000 incidents hour considered irregular sounds like must monitoring tens millions people least Touché Also ouch Perhaps I suppose we’ll see bandwidth almost always major rate limit For ‘big data’ I think usual pays thinking bring compute closer data For ‘big compute’ totally get many PS4s like What’s incentive participation People onboard computing systems network earn money machines since rented AI ML training workloads businesses

connect DB here Almost nothing requires scalability performance etc Yet I feel like interesting work also another level I even since I never dipped toes it I’m talking things like machine learning big data AI etc What person like even target that I hate write code However I love designing systems How interact make scale etc Any path won’t take 5 7 years able somewhere like solutions architect etc Currently 2 years After taking AWS Solutions Architect honestly really liked understanding systems worked bigger whole Not nitty gritty stuff Maybe i’m career crisis;The less interesting creative work is better pay be I think specific job company Working small growing startup probably best best able address kind issues Almost nothing requires scalability performance etc Idk backend service you’re working that’s flat lie Maybe it’s team service performance scalability always forefront design backend service Also explain architects typically need experience The reason companies want experience hiring people design systems experience writing systems “I’m big picture guy I don’t care nitty gritty details ”Does sound like someone you’d hire architect systems I m sure unique backend work I would say jobs industries interesting The jobs get cooler stuff generally sought require bigger hustle greater luck connections get in On hand I d wary working cool stuff It s always cool work sounds especially cool thing chosen cool actually best solution You Solutions Architect living AWS cloud companies have looked Data Engineering Lots scaling configuring nodes high level systems design especially working large datasets As person backend work large software company I m definitely dealing scalability performance considerations designing implementing systems You need switch entire career focus ML AI gain interest work Simply put wrong team company finding challenge domain This I m at It feels like getting work interesting projects comes luck much qualified I ve trying find work distributed systems databases something I ve studied quite interested in At point career feels hard steer direction I want rather taking job I feeling like I changing jobs trying move similar industry offers opportunities My solution move management positions 5 years I hopefully avoid situation If I want enjoy coding I selected task privately home Wait till something frontend spend time listening designers tell places want change margins ugh I’m talking things like machine learning big data AI etc Those necessarily related scalability performance You might want work larger company customer facing role customers performance scalability bigger concern Every job entails boring stuff In coding beginning always best part When things go wrong say it s alpha stage We ll patch later we ll redesign refactor later But time comes fun That s goes I make six figures spend time meetings I m bored fucking mind Should In many cases get H1 body shop grunt work people complain raise 3 5 years Sad part compensation potential green card staying employer makes easier Feel like explains job I generalize like that There far many boring SW jobs interesting creative also underpaid That explains software engineers make much money That s I m sure that s is Have read book Bullshit Jobs This But depends startup well Working enterprise company already customers already know scope project At startup big dreams know big going grow need consider scalability more However It s project management startup whether answer proposal spend month building system scalability instead week answered yeah let s it might 10m customers just write quick need hit milestone we ll cross bridge get it Sorry fault I clearer there Definitely always need think that However especially big enterprises lot applications employee facing low traffic projects team finds simpler approach faster cheaper worrying intracacies making system scalable performant Although Ill admit Correctness restartability fault tolerance high priorities I never found yet need really think performance scalability largely people think “enterprise big ” lot behind the scene apps things 10 20 people agents use even concurrently This probably company Other companies may backend systems need hyper scalability performance I think I over generalized Actually necessary quality technical leader You able delegate trust subordinates deal details However obviously requires make wise decisions big picture architecture first place Yes I know plenty people unable see big picture instead focus often unnecessary details The code touch worse is This people become Leads Principal anything equivalent Well that I meant I wish code implement actual systems I’d rather design architect system others would implement Obviously I’d knowledge it i’d rather focus that Maybe I wasn’t clear enough even though I think I was deleted I ll take job I m same I like meetings Maybe even love I spent entire career trying architecture people work less coding It surprises end people complain I consider dream job mind blown consider boredom worse constant work Boredom one highest states man absence negative stimuli worry need survival IME experienced sustained negative stimuli generally thankful bored learned even interpret boredom ennui deleted My advice would try transferring customer facing team Or team supports services customer facing team It might help excitement you’re seeking Of course necessary able delegate However OP saying wants direct projects bigger one person handle he s saying want deal implementation all As technical leader also advise details though It’s job mentor new hires help make key decisions require understanding details i think term big picture extremely vague Architects need know implementation details how part system communicates adding something Component Z add x Component A wont work break Component F nitty gritty details You delegate want knowledge come specific technical requirements people delegate must meet order things work ideally everyone team idea big picture That perfectly clear And I m saying much less appealing employer guy design well rolling sleeves implementing stuff well No one s going gamble big picture only guy unless already built ton credibility real great reputation coming in Because turns bored hard work Nice username As soon I find another one it Different strokes different folks I like stay busy This For exciting know thing I m building 30k monthly active users project manager gives us feedback users It s cool feel connected way end user even work mind blowing

bowling golfing tennising busy terms making living And good living I make too though sub would disagree 😄 deleted Do get time interests work actually require less number hours I would enjoy situation too Or rely stuff like audiobooks work I think we ve come similar ways illustrate point people experienced continuous negative stimuli heavy manual labor construction poverty child worry survival needs like food housing either consider boredom high state experience ennui signals absence negative stimuli I think I m spectrum probably reconsider writing two messages Fewer hours In office means

how;Building upon winning entry Austrian data scientists Philipp Singer Dmitry Gordeev the 2020 Big Data Bowl Next Gen Stats Analytics team introducing set metrics use player tracking data delve deeper ground game derived newly developed ability calculate Expected Rushing Yards Here Gordeev explained 2020 Big Data Bowl discussion board If focus rusher remove offensive team players looks like simple game one player tries run away 11 others try catch him We assume soon rushing play starts every defender regardless position focus stopping rusher ASAP every defender chance it The chances defender tackle rusher as well estimated location tackle depend relative location speed direction movements In complex environment like football traditional box score statistics like rushing yards yards per carry lack context needed reliably quantify player team rushing performance These stats give partial picture happened rush attempted ball moved certain number yards without telling much ball carrier succeeded failed Expected Rushing Yards offers collection derivative metrics enhance understanding running game What chances rusher gains least 4 yards play Or 10 yards Or 20 Generating probability distribution advantageous single point estimates sake future analysis probability distribution allows us derive probabilistic metrics like first down probability touchdown probability addition expected rushing yards;Because power Chubb compels him EDIT LOL Watch Baker s dot 6 It lose much ground hahaha I like watch Earl Thomas give up Nick Chubb elite Fuck play We getting back game crowd getting loud played good music mother fucker rips 88 yard touchdown basically seal it Chubb beast Here s context Expected Rushing Yards What type content would like see using stat season I assume nearly every rush 15 yards expected shorter run ends being no Is play Earl Thomas also gave want risk hurting leg something I want trust next gen stats like this tweet says “44 yards browns 33 ravens 21” shouldn’t start questioning deleted Chubb rise likely even bigger season year 2nd rushing TD s 20 yards since 2018 like eight consecutive goal line carries get TD last year That s I think I hear Chubb I love guy dynasty league Edit Sorry I wrong Was nine carries And majestic fashion Business Decision Chubb love Chubb life He Derrick Henry really stand look yards carry vs expected 2019 99 yard run 👑 Option runs purpose keep defense flowing runner deleted First I would change title post This new stat explain happened all It gives insight likely happen It helps explain statistically exceptional play was But stat nothing answer why I would want know specific plays underperforming expectation I d use metric like xG soccer used Try find play designs players coaches produce expected yards peers What formations successful What TE makes expected yards jump game You start run models expected yards replacement get idea quality Low hanging fruit compare expected yards actual splits conditions Home away Wet dry 4th quarter Winning losing Can get data last 3 4 years Let s look production screen passes checkdowns running QBs even return game It model informs RB performance really play ball players hands running gain yards With way people look it run goes 5 yards surprise This expected yards output neural network based players location speed direction field The better blocking bigger holes higher expected yards Theoretically runs running back roster would expected pick big gain Madden 92 speed one fastest TDs last year That s NEXT GEN STAT right there Do know 1 is looks like browns drafted wrong Georgia rb It 8 straight Chubb runs threw 2 3 fades Odell well ya shoot me Maybe shut bit more But also he shit that s love him “Gotta save hamstrings tonight” Geoegia elite RB name better combo That s awesome hear we re working concept show weekly leaders season We also piece coming Wednesday show much influence O lines affecting yards rushing expected Will post link published Tbh don’t really dial run need many yards With specific exceptions Looks Rams 2018 Running Lanes 6 defenders Yeah seriously I guess we’ll even swap Michel Chubb You’re welcome Cleveland This would satisfying memory went win game Georgia Election RiggingGeorgia Rising COVID cases Some RBs get clapped metric I d almost argue Chubb big play guy He second yards contact first broken tackles according pro football reference He hits pretty big home runs Freddie kitchens entered chat if need refresher beyond incompetent came calling plays inside 50 When get inside 10 would better luck monkey randomly pick play calling I d say looking historically NY beat both This I want see Checking dudes putting good great stats especially yds carry stat really good offenses Let s see evaluates them See RB s actually make difference team s offense vs getting expected given play Should good measure run effectiveness decision making athletic ability tackle breaking vision Love this Glad

concerns Data could used many beneficial ways way private communications infrastructure campaign finance system set led data mainly used boost effectiveness marketing With giant tech platforms able act monopolistic gatekeepers data acting within incentive structure capitalist economy resources directed whatever activity returns highest profits institutions already control capital required maintain platform monopolies manipulative unproductive usage big data inevitable due economic system Democratic decision making institutions collect distribute data necessary ever hope data used towards productive public good But Catch 22 legislative bodies required enforce democratic decision making process already captured extreme capital accumulated tiny private equity cabals control majority ownership big data platforms Personally I don’t think it’s impact I would like In America politicians love talk democratic are We live communication age We ability instantly provide feedback law table We don’t really need politicians vote interests At minimum could literally vote law representative vote majority voter base The representative democracy outdated It enables corruption If everyone vote would much harder buy votes don’t suit majority I remember reading analysis disinformation saying better educated countries rated higher degree trust institutions resilient spread disinformation So example places like Scandinavia Germany would relatively unsuccessful disinfo campaigns compared USA I’m curious research found We re still thick growing pains Specifically outgrowing authoritarian misinformation boob tube Passive media especially rich sensory stimulation like video encourages consumers suspend critical thinking ride along narrative moment Pair seven corporate entites several sole property specific billionaires controlling most news Americans see hear little less mysterious we ve kept allowing pair hopelessly corrupt private clubs dominate civic culture throughout Reaganomic era People know better now As knowledge spreads deepens less less support bogus partisan narratives I mean put clown like Donald Trump Oval Office keep people locked one cycle dystopian lies Unless media rallies similar level hate Joe Biden longer way shift blame mass incarceration perpetual war systematic economic exploitation away status quo power structure ultra rich insiders driving completely incoherent counterproductive war machine place might instead federal government sort It gave stupid people power Popular became important reality There discussion this context Qanon conspiracy theory recent episode Skeptics Guide Universe worth listening to The host s Steven Novella conclusion good bad Good sense access much information gatekeepers information largely bypassed But bad people lack critical thinking skills media literacy I m inclined agree digital technology leveraged extent could be We ve never interconnected nationally globally Never large institutions able quickly collect evaluate public opinion look quickly media companies respond consumer criticism marketing material e g Sonic s redesign EA s response Star Wars controversy So politics using technology better inform democratic process It seems that anything internet exacerbated things In United States people polarized ever meaningful dialogue seems like gargantuan task People stick echo chambers conspiracy theories anti intellectualism run rampant age access information ever before people confidently misinformed ever Interesting I ll definitely check out Thanks sharing To clarify I m specifically looking examples Big Data influenced democracy I already covered I m trying initiate discussion around idea see others think exchange ideas It matter people cover something I already wrote The fact much information part problem Who decides information gets shared where Who assessing veracity every claim Why democracy reactive like EA responding game criticism Instability reactivity desirable qualities government Plus need address fact information big data goes ways people get information architects society It lot easier manipulate espouse truth reason internet A live experiment running decades result people seek confirms already believe That aren’t philosophical discussions nature human governance society move forward instead argue whether mask going make suffocate infringe rights THAT legacy “Information Age ” Why democracy reactive like EA responding game criticism Instability reactivity desirable qualities government This good point However I would argue that produce data ever also tools decipher data Democracy espouses the people knowledge longer domain academic You would theoretically expect mankind collectively better informed ever before better able discern among beneficial path forward all better equipped rapidly act knowledge But said appears actually happened data used control top down Rather citizens collectively steering ship government government and institutions using data deceive polarise control citizens It s cynical I would like remain optimistic I unfortunately fear probably correct also tools decipher dataThis true number people good understanding tools decipher data much smaller people tend think is One general issues I think internet folks take account even internet connected societies majority people engaged online meaningful way Places like Reddit example disproportionate number lurkers commenters even fewer posters Most sites follow 1 rule So information platform discussion debate exists utilized would need talking about Further echo chambers captivating minority people online willing participate even smaller group willing participate cross ideological dialogue So technology capable talking about much practical reality many online people tend think I think twitter engagement platform US 48 million users roughly 40 active given day 9 10 million people actually using given day To utilize technology like talking without huge paradigm shift peoples behavior would leave small group actually participating group right likely much smaller participating representative democracy representatives senators flooded messages direct constituents primaries draw huge numbers people participating selection candidates Not mention federal items mirrored states state local levels

read correctly I went uni Y12 everything worked fine ultimately I would choose again Don t stay school Go uni Appreciate comment Thanks pointing fact I can t go back school left But attend Open Day learn uni life high school started sort feel naive hence I temptation go uni assessed carefully I hear much this UC students I chat say me What big social aspects Do require ID virtually every club Do

soo much reply really much appreciated Gives good view perspective people know Engineering students best These sorts leadership experiences quite valuable I think I put CV I apply jobs LinkedIn yes look frikkin good makes applying part time positions much easier task hence reason I still want remain school I m also interested politics youth politics as comments below makes hard decision I see becoming politician My mum argues going help much get industrial experiences mum 17 yr old Yr 13 currently student leader type roles chance to I see benefit applications scholarships skills

threatened I advised live warmer climates which I return UK parents moved back England I moved Wellington settling Auckland I quite decisive I would stick Software Engineering though I affection cloud VPS SQL things It bit hard consider SoftEng CompSci initially actually reached choice ticket goes SoftEng Software Engineering UC comprises also big component compsci contents Then choice uni Auckland UC Melbourne We went UC end though sometimes I thought myself offence here NZ bit naive I fell love country intention leaving Now final remaining bit whether skip Year 13 first year uni I agree changes decisions one reversed re reversed staying one year would allow think these And today s society also values multi disciplinaries Especially NZ much Britain parents never changed jobs adults I know NZ changed jobs least once I think I need take account Again thanks comment I Cambridge A Level Computer Science already I think somewhat standard two first year COSC courses The thing language introduced VB NET Python rather C Java usually taught uni papers Also I think COSC papers available distance learning Auckland But hey thank recommendation I consider highly Absolute bollocks Don t underestimate stuff scholarship application CV first job Except socially They do way It shows life you’ve picked extra shit valuable skills This mum s point She thinks none matters get industrial experience But I look people like Jacinda Nikki Kaye Chris Hipkins I m obsessed politics head prefects head girls boys I m sure many past present MPs successful people held roles back high school well Thank much I consider comment highly There time find hard consider CompSci SoftEng went SoftEng accreditation case I need move somewhere else also 800 hour work component But I fall love sorts cloud engineering network engineering SQL thing well I plan take additional papers uni I m social person yeah worth consider staying high school another year enjoy O week fullest Yup I also choose remain

going 17 If think Canterbury uni going skip opportunity take mistaken They need numbers big time They ll year As see here everyone s advice stay school Don t take granted Work hard upcoming year But make sure every day 4pm take deep breath Forget tomorrow Think 6am I’m student UC it’s great But trust you’re going miss anything waiting extra year In fact probably miss don’t All friends year group And good luck making friends people ages come year after You won’t classes doesn’t really work like think would You also wouldn’t able much everything official 18 even don’t plan drinking still need ID In high school friends want see leave Uni And sounds lots great opportunities there like club Take time enjoy high school offer next year Uni waiting You won’t regret it deleted No problem Good luck future Sounds like good one And mine precisely doing As soft skills sometimes sadly lacking new employees vitally important pick early age I m personally interested Politics fact hence things I see future becoming politician At least 50 You New Zealander House Commons NZer vote UK Brits enjoy rights NZ Med school gives zero fucks NZ almost entirely decided grades first year pre med papers uni interview It s dialect thing In NZ English Daddy Mummy seen words child longer cool right use age 8 years old turn Mum Dad It’s Brit thing I think messaging might easier hit whenever suits ya To fair it’s roles got are fact type people could get hold roles ‘success’ however define it breeds success It’s nice get wins like board you’re young help little getting next step like scholarship mentioned bolstering CV internship although time uni matters bit more It helps first part time job scholarships uni but unlikely scholarships you’re international BUT there’s reason can’t find similar leadership roles university I’d argue uni level leadership roles look way better high school ones I tons high school uni continue adult ones CV adult ones Debate team model UN toastmasters political party youth arm different activist groups like 350 Aotearoa Amnesty International campus there’s hundred ways get leadership roles uni But 16 quite young there’s likely maturity gap everyone else may make socially difficult Yes exactly She s right got industrial shit yet Don t let saddos stuck dreary job ruts forum ain t worth shit attitudes decide you How going talk people industry want get seeing say No I mean I really understand genuine way how I going miss social lives I idea social lives uni genuine I asking I figure O week one thing If become citizen MP resident NZ vote When I went med school back 2010 interview It s based grades UMAT score I might wrong I hear Auckland med school regard highly applicants St John Grand Prior s Award award participants work towards learning first aids sorts soft skills daddy s Irish Anglo or Anglo Irish elementary knowledge Irish Gaelic rhotic accent I inherit him In Irish Gaelic dad daidí I feel personally really sick pronounce r words like car There UC scholarships intl students 15 20k towards tuition fees 6k towards accommodation But hey thanks comment Gives good insight uni I realised I ve underestimating societies uni well truly Do require ID become club members clubs Hey point transferable skills good point thanks it I ve never considered skills transferable seriously though I put CV I suspect helped getting jobs List UC clubs here active others Depends club whether need student ID Technically need certain amount current students official club open others usually informal ones others require I would suspect ENSOC falls category

marketability data used undergraduate curriculum This pisses following reasons 1 We recently received across board paycut 2 The administration treating completely dispensable respect COVID teaching responsibilities 3 The task chair asked us NTT would ask full time data scientist do The last I checked DS PhDs get paid vicinity 120k 140k year I DS experience I estimate task asked complete take neighborhood 1 week WE ARE ASKED TO DO THIS WITHOUT BEING COMPENSATED Items 1 2 really ingratiate department university 3 downright explotation I sick tired voluntary pro bono work How I tell chair fuck off politely I hoping write saying the magnitude uncompensated task teaching assignment assigned consume 1 week more I time moment Data scientists paid neighborhood 120k 140k evaluate large

open right now asking friend Love kisses ZaphodEdit RE contract I 9th month contract I get paid summer course by course basis I agree teaching courses then;deleted The pay disparity argument nonstarter We people department earn 25 50 k service Well actually people paid less that s problem assess service What would reasonable argument whether currently on contract much service expected perform here non permenant NTTs expected minimal service permanent 5 year contract NTTs expected lot That sounds like undergrad curriculum committee work committee work part appointment If not I d try pointing appointment duty percentages 0 service say If work HR probably next step course might make cranky sucks I went dilemma I m NTT department also treats like persona non grata This summer lot course monitors redoing lower level courses they re asking non tenure track faculty teaching lower level courses work them My solution stop reading University emails act like I read ones I saw I respond anybody says anything I ll say I vacation would I read work email If feel need respond simply write one line sentence say sounds really interesting however vacation right visiting parents mistress guru unable it My University acts like they re boss us we re plugged 24 7 them So I deliberately unplugged I need separate work life personal life I feel right intrude personal time But others suggested look contract I know institution non tenure track faculty appointment August May If that s case obligation anything explain anyone Do contract A union At university NTT faculty could would straight decline uncompensated task Sorry situation It typical administration nonsense asking don’t let bother you Make lemonade lemons Provide small preliminary testimonial “prospects potential

highly specialized technical work I agree lot feedback provided here You always balance needs future job prospects how much trouble get in If actually indispensable know contract pretty secure next term comfortably say no If not taking bit chance At point I ok getting trouble refusing something off months I rolling contract salaried responsibilities 9 months academic year I anything summer without stipend though would tempered contract renewal stuff You could tell busy work summer since contract whatever 9 month etc able get committee work begins August Ahh Well I assume paid class gives solid basis declining task I would let know although compensated kind task happy consulting rate 100 hour It I done enough free labor data analysis department want anymore It ridiculous You might suggest would better chair contact statistics department see potential collaborators department might interested research integrating real world data analysis curriculum deleted Actually university Adjuncts also up to full time NTT expected or ever asked administrative work Good point At Uni NTT’s contracts specifically stipulate dedicate 20 time service RE contract I 9th month contract I get paid summer course by course basis I agree teaching courses then deleted Our NTTs supposed 50 50 nuts But do end lot service NTT schools Yes explicitly I said larger point remains valid

Amsterdam native going start master next year Computer Science Big data engineering I couple questions wondering anyone couple minutes spare answer questions below 1 What reasonable starting salary 2 How get first internship 3 What would differently university increase chances finding good job I situation specific questions I want bother everyone sub questions I think answers questions might useful people situation me Thank guys input advance;For 3 I would study specific technology demand rise work towards getting certification it An obvious examples AWS hundreds technologies less known still high demand Certifications useful DevOps world I m 100 sure find multiple useful certifications specific Big Data big data analysis AWS already sounds stupidly demand example Just remember certification enough job good clear minimum requirements many positions pass automated screening What really gets job knowledge make sure study well several demoable projects own mention applications 1 Your salary increase get productive knowledgeable I would focus improving first developer job Consulting contracting good place start see different projects companies etc 2 Trend friend I started dot com boom super easy get job developing websites even without computer science studies Starting career something new means almost everyone beginner there 3 Personally I graduated sooner rather take much extra curriculum You university learn new things This answer question I actively hire software engineers I wanted contribute something may help Modern tech companies look people skills cultural fit much intensely days deciding candidate especially one less experience require support than experienced candidates grow impact How work others solve problems grow yourself adapt deal conflicts gather requirements seek feedback respond mistakes But importantly communicate You gaps technical that’s normal think approach craft set candidates going open role apart Consider circumstances expose areas well studies Not engineer sn architect myself I think start graduates 2500 2800 days 1 Honestly I clue since I start career country 2 I made app uploaded AppStore sent CV code link app bunch companies one responded offered unpaid internship help land paid job shortly afterwards 2 months working experienced people kickstart I needed Not sure useful is considering big data engineer maybe consider showing skills portfolio writing article case study Also targeting particular company smart show know something that s directly useful them eg fintech company might like see using big data finance stuff etc 3 I would gone tech meetupsand joined extra curricular activities and or student organizations There s better thing work connections Especially first job internship never know one fellow students might able refer somewhere job internship Do ask situation specific questions since different software engineers different experiences Also terms tech stack I recommend everything find something really like become good that also try match market asking for check StackOverflow jobs ads eg Don t go flow everyone else sake something better highly specialised something that s attractive rewarding work with Thanks lot tip I m working projects thought actually getting certified probably good addition boost resume Personally I graduated sooner rather take much extra curriculum You university learn new things I m kind debating well I m taking EC s I gather post better enter job market soon possible instead getting max education long run Is gross net Oef dat een stuk minder dan ik verwacht Definitely try it getting certification never difficult Actually stuff knowledge acquire training is As soon comfortable with I tried max education many subject kicking forward maths studies I needed advanced CS topics I did t lot focus studies caused stress later on Gross definitely gross Tbh graduates still “useful” business need lot coaching still In experience junior sofware engineer increase salary pretty fast though I doubled salary 5 years Of course that’s harder crisis depends learning trajectory Wat voor salaris je dan gedachte als gestudeerde ik ben oprecht nieuwsgierig aangezien 2800 bruto voor een starter echt wel gangbaar is Check anders op hier krijg je een goed inzicht salarissen Ps check anchormen nl internships big data company might good start you Well An awful lot graduates use first Until perform basic tasks minimal supervision basically investment Can confirm Except took 10 years double it that s I changing companies often enough bad negotiator That s true I guess I fixated starting salary starting first job Ik dacht zelf aan ongveer 3200 3500 maar van wat ik heb gezien dat niet een realistisch start salaris buiten amerika Bedankt voor de link het heeft mij een benodigde reality check gegeven This If want get salary change often Not much work you Stay employer years don’t expect increase salary much Don’t scared won’t fun colleagues somewhere else I happen I 12 employers 20 years working IT Ja de usa kan je veel meer krijgen maar betaal je ook veel meer voor andere voorzieningen Er trouwens een reden waarom IT’ers gaan freelancen er komt een moment dan werkgevers niet meer willen betalen ga je freelancen dan verdubbel je je inkomen Eerste paar jaar gewoon veel ervaring op doen bij voorkeur een toko die aanzien heeft Je hebt dan mogelijkheden en het open deuren Imo that s many I d really suspicious many moves True I overdid it Although looks like I working freelancer longer I

high availability — large pool data 3 2 1’d;How storage planning strategy sound Current situation 6 TB data 8 TB EasyStores always offline except backups Two backup copies kept identical 8TB externals ONE 8TB EasyStores failing almost gone Need buy something week How sound 1 Buy Synology 2 bay2 Buy 14TB drive3 Load solo Synology enclosure4 Now I three data pools 14TB 8TB 8TB I 6TB data I won’t use extra space while I scale time comes I still keep two backup copies two 8TB externals problem 3 2 1 backups When storage needs exceed 8TB 1 Buy ANOTHER Synology 2 bay2 And ANOTHER 14TB drive3 Now I 3 data pools 14TB 14TB 8TB4 Since 8TB inadequate full backup I save money span third copy across existing 8TB older external like so 14TB Synology 2 bay DATA COPY 114TB Synology 2 bay DATA COPY 28TB external DATA COPY 35TB external DATA COPY 3Then needs eventually grow beyond 13TB store DATA COPY 3 cloud add 3rd 2 bay Synology 14TB drive Once I exceed 14TB data I double size Synology boxes adding 14TB drives 28TB Synology 2 bay 2 drives DATA COPY 128TB Synology 2 bay 2 drives DATA COPY 2 DATA COPY 3 could either cloud span multiple external USB drives I add I need high availability high

advice critiques I could kick van road buy another 14TB EasyStore buuuut IDK;A 2 bay NAS great But growth hoard slow Use one drives shared data frequent versioned snapshot style backups Very efficient robust If hoard grows fast buy BIG avoid buying again That great waste money long run As well lot frustration Buy biggest available drives 16TB I currently 4x16TB NAS several smaller 16TB 12TB NAS I building 16 bay fileserver NAS I Linux user I use mainly NFS That means I cache NFS data locally NVMe speed access NAS So far 1 GbE enough me Have two ancient 2bay NAS’s starting out yes it’s terrible strategy Eventually can’t reused convenient manner You’ll outgrow it also makes harder deal cold backups Frankly I wouldn’t even recommend 4 5 6 bays I’d personally say 8 bay mini ITX with 10g Ethernet port future thank you case start let juggle various hdd’s SSD’s gather time come And you’ve got problem outgrow it hard drives cheaper therapy jump used supermicro 36bay chassis What mean almost failing Nothing wrong 2 bay solutions long comfortable layout options 2 independent disks raid 0 1 It s little limiting regard Realize asking hoarder sub consider 2 bays enough storage We re obviously biased For folks 2 bays last long time 16 18TB drives came they ll eventually come price I ve outgrown I ll selling DS218 week I offload files In case might interested lightly used gear Thank you great info I guess that’s million dollar question predicted growth rate Right it’s photo hobby I’ve lurking sub I’m getting itch hoard In outlined strategy initial cost downstream upgrades minimal I hit 28TB at point I’d need buy new drives NAS s remove one 14TB drives NAS s replace 20TB drive when exist JBOD configuration I e 14 20 14 30 Hey u Glix 1H Here 80 days earlier conversation I’ve come back say YOU WERE RIGHT “8 bays 10GbE” sarcasm Two months ago I bought Synology DS920 3x12TB bought 8 bay 10GbE recommended I’m going buy DS1819 8 bay 10GbE capable 130 more The DS920 used back DS1819 it’s bad The big question now Since DS920 50 less bays RAID I use it SHR1 RAID0 Right I 11TB data big deal I wait decide Run NAS boxes SHR1 8 bay 10g I can’t tell that’s sarcasm With 2 bay strategy I should good YEARS My data growth 2TB year Just DSLR hobby I don’t anticipate needing 28TB data next five years Also I don’t multi thousand dollar budget Good question I trying MD5 hundred GB taking inordinate amount time When I pulled backup mirror ran task much faster I read long read write times indicate failing drive I seemed isolated problem one drive Thank much I appreciate reply Fair point bias datahoarder sub That said I’m thinking 4 bay larger now One thing I’m considering 10GBe I probably want eventually Do know advantage buying Synology 10GBe built in one I upgrade 10GBe later Do know new DS920 upgraded 10GBe I can’t tell FYI single HDD 220 150MB s sequential easily saturates 1G Ethernet 110MB s whereas even extensive NAS configurations sit comfortably within 10G You notice greatly appreciate difference browsing files especially mirror configuration allows scaling read speeds mirrors Basically pick board either 10G enough sata ports don’t create dead end years You use pcie slot cover whatever doesn’t onboard Alternatively use older computer old case Idle energy costs also may turn much thought On second look seems ITX option either I suggested quickly gets pricey even 300 low end would better spent large board cpu money left over I could sworn something reasonable I seen past In case reusing older pc frankly way go don’t one eBay goodwill would first stops Check SMART data I m asking coz recent hdd fail quickly unless heat vibrations involved Being USB enclosure I m sure run beside desk move around open air This may failing I think disks run 50 60C everyday lol Get dedicated space externals there s little human contact possible You seem like would want spend nas A nas mostly used central area files 24 7 mention There s point simply wasting money require it I suggest start space get usb fans direct disk Also raid 1 mirror recommended Just 2 14TBs backup manually them They WON T fail fast add USB fans Looks like buy DS1618 DS1817 10G support They 750 800 Synology products 10G capability nice lot affordable take advantage used enterprise stuff uses SFP instead ethernet That would mean building server e g build guides serverbuilds net If type likes build tinker actually achieve performance less money Synology products Synology makes everything plug play point click A lot people willing pay extra ease convenience Thanks info I check 10GBE At first glance looks like 10GBE 10GBE switch least 500 Yikes I guess figure contain data less maybe I bite bullet Ahh that’s bummer Are go to PC models purpose How much would budget eBay find Thanks reply I appreciate information Oh power consumption noise minimal best since powered day two month maybe big deal I’ll investigate thanks At first glance CrystalDisk Windows Any recommendations MacOS Thanks I’m going run SMART check disk backup finishes but perhaps unsurprisingly stuck copying 30 MB file last half hour I’ll see positioning USB drives way cools better This

homelab;i00cs4;1596027916.0;/r/homelab/comments/i00cs4/need_quality_of_service_guidance/;Need Quality Service guidance;I never done QoS need learn soon For folks work ISP ISP like multi tenant environment implementing bandwidth restriction clients tenants I 3 tenants far 10Gbps backbone network I need limit upload download tenants cloud providers This mostly big data file transfer want limit FIFO free network define lets say 2Gbps tenants Also tenant see other This done via virtual router Junos VRF lite Cisco The thing I could think traffic shaping I want drop clients packets so I think I use shaping instead policing The topology tenant 10g RTR 10g RTR 10g Internet I really want lab EVE NG soon possible get experience I really losing mind QOS thing I even know start;ISP s usually two things 1 They hierarchical QoS policy subscriber input output The outer parent queue usually shaper sometimes policer set max bandwidth subscriber The inner child queues matched depending service Usually voice video for IPTV services generic internet Voice usually priority ie interrupt queue policed queue something like 500k 1Mbps Video guaranteed bandwidth queue something like 20 50Mbps Internet bandwidth remaining queue whatever left Depending access technology also may mark 802 1p bits access layer core qos strictly layer 2 They also mark DSCP bits packets inbound account voice internet business class internet 2 They something similar core access layers usually 4 queues voice video ie IPTV residential internet business internet services They hierarchical QoS generally something like 10 bandwidth guaranteed voice 45 guaranteed IPTV 45 guaranteed business residential gets whatever left although set 4 queues share whatever left Also percentages change depending provider data services actually use x200B Most equipment vendors also offer BNG Broadband Network Gateway functionality automate 1 as well things access technology agnostic implementations ie customer VLAN router My understanding shaping is shaping applied outbound This another confusing me For option 1 business purchased 1Gbps ISP would apply shaper closest router customer Then outbound to backbone interface shaper policy outbound goes interface facing customer outbound shaper policy Am I correct one I working Juniper MX Cisco ASR routers Juniper MX Cisco ASR ASR9K shaping ingress egress directions These routers massive amounts queues QoS capabilities designed for There never shaper customer backbone interfaces ie ISP router router interfaces policier shaper always placed customer facing interfaces ie interface customer s default route IP address L2 interface access network When talking MX 9K routers often IP Edge subscriber edge router meaning contain IP interface customer default route So almost always outbound QoS policing shaping policy customer them There obvious exceptions Cable access CMTS IP edge device This done ISP want place traffic onto access network often precious bandwidth have drop later Where inbound QoS performed really depends last mile access You correct placed device close customer possible Place IP router always works done access network done there Our routers ASR1002 HX MX480 I joined team far I know classifying traffic It seems like I anything routers routers connected customers So case limit customer 1Gbps 1Gbps I would ingress egress directions customer facing interface only What VoIP video traffic I guess I need mark classify traffic closest source create policy every router treat packets differently The drop probability another confusing thing I even know ask question this It seems like I anything routers routers connected customers Correct x200B So case limit customer 1Gbps 1Gbps I would ingress egress directions customer facing interface only Correct The exception would ingress upload direction customer IF device closer customer it What VoIP video traffic I guess I need mark classify traffic closest source create policy every router treat packets differently Yes need classify mark traffic DSCP TOS EXP bits every ingress point network ie peering links get residential internet marking SIP gateway servers get voice marking video servers get video marking etc x200B The drop probability another confusing thing I even know ask question this You drop probability You shaper defined queue depth Within shaper multiple queues service defined order If exceed queue depth drop packets Correct The exception would ingress upload direction customer IF device closer customer it What customer starts downloading let s say file server university University R E uses high bandwidth multi threaded file transfer application near line rate speed Do I need apply shaping ingress direction Internet facing interface About drop probability I confused one get drop example traffic marked AF22 vs AF33 I believe AF33 get drop first AF22 even though AF3x higher priority AF2y What packets marked AF23 vs AF33 one get drop first What customer starts downloading let s say file server university University R E uses high bandwidth multi threaded file transfer application near line rate speed Do I need apply shaping ingress direction Internet facing interface You need internet facing interface Just ingress egress customer interface All multi threaded file transfer applications TCP or maybe QUIC super advanced back throughput starts dropping packets x200B About drop probability I confused one get drop example traffic marked AF22 vs AF33 I believe AF33 get drop first AF22 even though AF3x higher priority AF2y What packets marked AF23 vs AF33 one get drop first The routers form Weighted Round Robin WRR usually using form token bucket servicing queues that define weighted order based bandwidth define For example 3 queues assign 25 25 50 bandwidth service 1500 bytes queues 1 1500 bytes queue 2 3000 bytes queue 3 repeat The routers care AF23 vs AF33 UNLESS define queues way All packets equal define queue EXP TOS DSCP meaning define it The exception routers usually secret priority queue router originated control traffic ISIS OSPF PIM ARP BGP BFD etc etc These packets router originates placed system generated priority queue interface
