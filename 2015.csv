talesfromtechsupport;3uaxtw;1448509679.0;/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3uaxtw/consulting_wars_part_1_welcome_to_thunderdome/;Consulting Wars, Part 1, welcome to Thunderdome…;  I'm working for a consulting shop and I'm starting a long term project at $Health_Insurer, supplementing their Governance and Risk department. Most of the work is doing assessments of vendors, but sometimes there are other projects. I'm always game for the 'other projects', since I have a belief that I can bring in more work for the consulting shop.    Which, as everybody should know, is consulting job #1.    Unfortunately, there’s another consulting shop at $Health_Insurer(HI). They used to do the vendor assessments, but ‘something bad happened’ and they lost the gig. They’re in charge with a few other related gigs, like tracking and remediating findings, and migrating their existing tracking tool to a $Magical_Vaporware.    As you might imagine, I’m not in a friendly environment.    First gig is to finally force $Big_Data_Vendor(BDV) to submit to an assessment. $Other_Consulting_Shop (OCS) had sent them an assessment, but that came back with a thinly veiled “go away” letter. BDV must think themselves pretty damn special to not even bother to lie to me.    I send the assessment and a nicely worded email to Cassandra, BDV’s Director of Compliance. After three days, I figure it’s time for a phone call.    me:”Hi. Is there some reason you won’t respond to my request?”      Cassandra:”We don’t see the point. HI’s not going to drop us, nor are any other insurers. We have appropriate controls. “    me:”Can I set an appointment with you or your staff to go over this?”    Cassandra:”No. We’re too busy. We already explained why to your predecessor”    Oh, great. Methinks they’re not going to be exactly cooperative.    A conversation with the lead at OCS reinforces this belief. They’re going to call anything other than a full report ‘incomplete’ in the tracking tool, which means:     * We won’t be able to bill for this assessment * This will be an open issue for every status report, giving someone at HI to complain about.    I have to make this happen. I need to get creative.    I poke about BDV’s website and see that their client base is almost entirely healthcare. They do some kind of buzzword compliant big data healthcare event management, which I interpret as ‘can we deny the claim’?    I get an idea. I spoof a 973 area code (North Jersey) phone number and create an alter ego, Vinnie Goombatz, the ‘Director of Analytics’ at ’Garden State Health Insurance’. Vinnie enters his data into the contact form at BDV.    A day later, a chipper sales droid calls Vinnie up on my spoofed number. Vinnie is interested,but he has to send some security person to ‘get some answers’. Sales droid is willing to facilitate, even getting a half day blocked out with Cassandra to answer questions…       I book my flight. This is going to be fun…[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3uw0ga/consulting_wars_part_2_just_change_the_format/);"On the one hand, this was posted 20 minutes ago and it only sets the scene and I want more now.

talesfromtechsupport;3wzh2n;1450211110.0;/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3wzh2n/18_old_spindles_does_not_equal_4_new_spindles/;18 old spindles does not equal 4 new spindles.;"A long, long time ago in a (server closet) far, far away...  &nbsp (This tale was inspired by [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3wo5fz/if_youre_going_to_order_an_application_server/) and brought the memory back to life.)  &nbsp I ran a group of PersonSoft servers on a collection of [Compaq Proliant 6000](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xwCgcUwzAbM/hqdefault.jpg)'s. One was a database server, and it was packed with 18 drives, 9.1GB 15k RPM Ultra/320 SCSI. Old stuff. I mean, gawd, this thing used massive quantities of EDO DIMM's and was so heavy, it took 3 people to rack them.  &nbsp Now, we used MSSQL on this. The databases were fairly huge, and both HR's and Accounting's databases were on this thing, so it was hammered on a regular basis, what with monthly financials and payroll every week. I learned a lot about SQL query plans and optimizing SQL queries in that role. The goal was always to reduce disk I/O's to keep things moving. It was kinda cool to see all those LED's blinking away like crazy during busy periods.  &nbsp   One day, I'm told we are going to get our first SAN. The company known as ""crooked E"" had partnered with a big-name big-data storage firm to produce private label SAN's. Awesome, awesome, awesome! And new ""crooked E"" servers to boot, waaaaay faster than our Big Steel Behemoths!  &nbsp   So an engineer came to visit, and I made sure he knew we had big performance needs, showed him those 18 spindles, said we want lots of space, and he took note of ""my"" servers and those other ones like the file servers. Fibre channel switches, HBA's, lions and tigers, oh my! This was going to be great!  &nbsp   This engineer even ran load-monitoring software for a couple of weeks to collect metrics. From all that info, he would design a SAN to accomodate all our needs. Sounded delicious to me, can I learn more?  Gimme!  &nbsp   What came back was a CX3 with a single shelf of disk, all 146GB 10k. And the amount of space allocated for the MSSQL system was spread across 4 spindles of 72GB disk -- shared with the file server, no less. I was flabbergasted.  I protested that this was going to severely reduce database performance.  I took perfmon graphs and manufacturer IOPS ratings and tried till I was blue in the face and was told to take it. Ooookay ... ignore evidence at your own peril, boss, but I tried to tell you. My boss was a good man but had pressure from other corners.  &nbsp   Go-live on the new servers & SAN came along, and the complaints blew up my mailbox within days. KABOOM! I pulled out those emails, and the new perfmon graphs showing disk queue saturation, and even walked people into the server room and said ""See that bank of lights? Our old server kept them blinking at 100% load, and the new one is doing the same, 18 blinking lights was better than 4 new blinking lights"".  Within two weeks we were ordered back on the old equipment.  &nbsp   In the end, I was able to use my statistics and analysis to convince my boss we needed another shelf of high-performance, smaller disks to ensure the IOPS were there for the databases. We didn't need smaller disk because they could spin faster, but because there were more spindles. (For those that don't know, a spinny-platter disk can roughly handle about 150 operations per second, rule of thumb. Going from 10k to 15k changes this... a little, not a lot.) Moar spindles! Moar speeeeeed!!  &nbsp   I was then given free reign to completely redesign the storage groups and RAID groups on the entire SAN for all servers. After many spreadsheets and metrics collection & analysis, I was able to implement a brand new layout that generated exactly *zero* complaints about performance. I was very pleased.  &nbsp   Lesson here, kiddies: never ignore the biggest bottleneck of your system. SSDs are really wonderful, by the way. Most apps need I/O throughput, if they deal with a lot of data. CPU and RAM are essential, but not the only story.  &nbsp   TL DR: In which an ancient Compaq Proliant 6000 bested a brand new set of servers and SANs.";"Yup - folk just don't seem to grasp performance (in iops) compared to throughput (in MB/s) and capacity (TB).  You can do a lot for bursty IO with SSD caching at the controller level - I love LSI's CacheCade for that. Better yet, ZFS on the array with a properly configured system. Assuming you're not throwing money at something big that implements tiered storage.  Something else folk in smaller shops don't always get (although it seems to have been getting better) is that you shouldn't treat iSCSI the same as the rest of your LAN traffic. Latency spikes, out even worse a non-zero TCP retransmit count, can be huge performance killers.#> Compaq Proliant 6000  My god, you weren't kidding about this being a long time ago in a server room far, far away!  I haven't seen one of those in - well, decades!#Eh... I know those 6000 servers...  You're supposed to be 4 to lift and rack them.   Also, those SCSI320 HDDs were GOOD! (when they were new). I still haven't pulled the last MSA1000-series SAN from the bottom of a rack, yet. It's not as if we need the place, and yeah, the weight of the MSA and additional disk shelf + heaps of SCSI320 drives makes for a stable rack...   Can you remember which RAID-controller was in the server? and if it had battery-backed write-cache?  (Been a server man since the Prosignia times.)#Yup.. The very reason each of my exchange servers is sporting 24 disks. I didn't need all the space.. I needed spindles.#[removed]#I think you would have enjoyed getting a Hybrid SAN in there.   We just moved from a spinning disk array to a Tegile hybrid and the difference in latency and throughput is night and day.  It's amazing.  And on top of that, it's compressing and de-duping on the fly.#Thought I was in /r/destinythegame and was very confused...#> I ran a group of PersonSoft servers on a collection of Compaq Proliant 6000's. One was a database server, and it was packed with 18 drives, 9.1GB 15k RPM Ultra/320 SCSI.  I loved that hardware back then. I had its ""smaller brother"" (compaq 5500) next to my bed for quite a while, with 4 PPro 200, 4 9.1GB disks (not all slots used), and an external enclosure with 7*4.3GB.  I did get into some arguments with my girlfriend back then (""That thing is too loud to sleep!"" -- ""Well, I can sleep with it, and I sure as hell won't switch it off""), and eventually got so used to the noises that it woke me up if the hard disk activity from cron daily early in the morning didn't start for some reason.#The last week or so on TFTS has made me wonder how we got any work done before SSD's."

We published a paper in PLOS ONE that constructed a model that can help establish an institution’s gift-giving profiles and help organizations set fundraising goals – Ask Us Anything!;Hi Reddit!My name is Andy Reagan and I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Vermont](http://www.uvm.edu). My research focuses on computational social dynamics: using big data to better understand language, happiness, and health. I am joined by Bill Gottesman, a designer and builder of [sundials](http://www.precisionsundials.com), and Dr. Peter Dodds, Director of the Vermont Complex Systems Center and a Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the [University of Vermont (UVM)](http://www.uvm.edu). Dr.  Dodds teaches courses on the [principles of complex systems](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/teaching/courses/300) and [complex networks](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/teaching/courses/303) at UVM. His research covers complex systems and networks in general, with recent work focusing on social contagion, sociotechnical phenomena, happiness, language, and stories.We recently published an article titled [“Collective Philanthropy: Describing and Modeling the Ecology of Giving”](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0098876)in [PLOS ONE](http://www.plosone.org/). We found that philanthropic gifting appears to follow an approximate power-law size distribution, and detailed forms of gift-size distributions differ across but are relatively constant within charity categories. We showed how knowledge of gift-sized distributions may be used to assess an institution's gift-giving profile, to help set fundraising goals, and to design an institution-specific giving pyramid.We will be answering your questions at 1pm EST (10am PST) on December 16 -- Ask Us Anything!Follow Andy on Twitter [@andyreagan](https://twitter.com/andyreagan) for updates on PhD life and his black lab, Finn.

I had two questions.   1) Does an individuals knowledge of the girts of others effect there own giving? I believe it was in freakonimics that it was mentioned that with taxation, knowing that everyone else is paying there taxes has a large impact.  2) Do you have any feelings on the ethics of tax deductions associated with charitable donations, in so far as they all the wealthy to choose where their tax dollars go when the poor are not afforded the same privilege?  Thank you so much for doing this AMA!#Institutionally this very unique project and direction to take. What lead to this research taking place at the University of Vermont?  #A couple questions -   1) What holidays (other than xmas) seem to spark the highest spikes in charitable gift giving?  2) How can smaller charities use this data to project fundraising goals against largest ones, especially in peak times like the holiday season?#Hi Peter, Bill, and Andy.   Charities has very different levels of efficiency in terms of $ spent on programs vs administration. Is there any relationship between institution size, efficiency and donation size? #In your paper, why did you decide to use gift rank instead of the actual dollar value of the gift?  Thanks!#Hello,  I was wondering whether you have attempted (or are planning) to validate your model in other countries, particularly in developing countries?   Also, would you expect to see a similar profile for donations made to an external institution (i.e. not within the same country where the gift originated)?#As others have mentioned in previous questions, there seems to be a positive correlation between lower/middle income donations and religious charities. I may have not looked close enough at the article but I was wonder if from a charity's perspective does it make more sense to look for more smaller donations or fewer large donations?#Another question: You suggest that a modified version of Pareto's principle can render better results for charities. While the data seems to corroborate with your analysis, has this been tested/validated yet?#If I'm reading your figures correctly, it looks like people in lower and middle class incomes give to religious organizations more than any other category. When we get to upper class ($200K-$1M) that shifts to education and over $1M the focus is primarily on education and health. As income increases, donations to religious organizations decrease.   Can you comment on why you think this is the trend? Were there other factors that help explain this? For example, do education levels follow the same trend?   I'm thinking of work done in the social sciences that suggests education and health are some of the most impactful places to donate. Perhaps higher education means a more likely exposure to this kind of research. But there is also perhaps a refocus of how those funds are being spent. Religious donations tend to be towards someone's own faith community - i.e. it is donating to help the in-group. Health and education are bigger categories that encompass in-group and out-group. #Your manuscript shows a fascinating trend in religious giving that seems to correlate strongly with income level. Do you think that socio-economic and/or culutural pressures are influcencing this trend? In other words, if you corrected for cultural factors in your models if these trends would survive the conditional analysis? Similary, does education level strongly predict educational giving? Do we simply give to what we know (suggesting that outreach, education, and community involvement would be key to fundraising efforts, more than, say, the emotional impact of the charity- ie giving to disaster aid or toys for poor children at the holidays) or are there other major effect factors at play that you have identified?#Hi, I have a question for Dr. Dodds.   Dr. Dodds, social contagion and sociotechnical phenomina must be rapidly evolving fields, in recent years what do you think has been the most surprising or exciting development in these fields, and what if any change in these dynamics do you see happening as a result of new social media platforms used by youth (ex. snap chat, yik yak, etc).   Thank you for taking the time out of your day to do this!#How do concurrent natural disasters affect gift distributions?#What is a ""giving pyramid""?

The money came from employees, but the company might have been writing off the deduction.#This AMA is being permanently archived by *The Winnower*, a publishing platform that offers traditional scholarly publishing tools to traditional *and* non-traditional scholarly outputs—because scholarly communication doesn’t just happen in journals.

(Currently have MPH and MS in Statistics);[deleted];"[deleted]#You are an interesting case....  My first gut feeling is to recommend you to complete an Associate's degree in CS at a local community college. A course sequence like CS-1, CS-2 (Object Oriented Programming), Data Structures, Algorithms, Programming Languages, plus one or two more. Given that professionally you are probably going to do what a lot of people call ""data science"" these days, you may want a course on databases (even though you know SQL), and a course on AI/Machine learning.  This is probably the fastest way, if you want an education to back you up. Associate's degree does not count for much by itself, but you have two MS degrees, one of which is in Statistics, so this makes you look reasonably good.  You probably don't want a BS degree.  For MS degrees, there are two options. There are some that admit people without necessary prerequisite coursework. They largely suck to be in. Other programs will require preliminary coursework - they will prepare you well, but add another year to your studies.  Either way, the CC coursework is going to be a good step. You will be able to see after completing it how competitive you are on the market.  PS. There is an implicit assumption that you are in the US, as this might work differently if you are elsewhere.#There are many masters programs for CS which are available with no prior experience and an unrelated undergrad degree. The fact that you even know what SQL and R are is good enough!   I do think it is quite odd to get a second bachelors if you already have a higher level degree with the masters though. I'm saying this as a person who is doing a second bachelors, btw! It might also be a good option for you because some second degree bachelors programs only take ~2 years, like mine.#With that background, honestly, if you just teach yourself some programming concepts, you really won't need another degree to get a programming job anywhere.  Definitely if you have the means, time and interest to do an MSCS, though, you should have no trouble getting into a program and doing well at it (the part I struggled with the most when I did my MSCS was the statistics and probability stuff).  They'll make you take some ""leveling"" undergraduate courses before you can begin your graduate work, but there's really no point in getting a second bachelors degree.#I'm in a similar situation - I did my undergraduate degree in psychology, and I'm finishing an MSc in neuroscience.  Like you said, the day to day can be pretty mind numbing, so I'm looking at pretty much the same options that you listed.    Some schools in my area offer one year post-degree programs in CS that cover all of the core classes and set you up well for a master's degree in CS.  Coming from stats your math background is probably much stronger than mine, so that might be more than you need.  Ultimately I plan to do a course-based master's in CS, which I've heard is a great way to change fields and be attractive to employers in a short amount of time.  I'm also doing a few things to try to make myself look more attractive to graduate CS programs as a non-CS student.  Since I have research experience I was able to find a CS lab at my school that was willing to take me for a practicum, which I have to do for my MSc anyways.  It's a great way to learn from successful CS students while contributing to a project that you can actually put on your CV, and it's also a good way to get a reference letter from a faculty member in the field.    Since I primarily use R for my data cleaning and analyses, I'm planning to contribute to some user-made packages.  A lot of them accept contributions on GitHub, and I've been told that contributing to open source is a good way to build a CV.#I would go for another grad degree at this point. You might have to take a few undergrad level courses first as part of the program,  but that's pretty standard no matter the major. "

Never thought this day would come, but now I have a choice here of which I am both grateful and concerned.                                     **Company A**: I was an intern last year at this relatively ""well-known"" game company. They have offered me an internship this year again (related to big data, which is what I want), in a different department. However when I was there, I discovered gaming is not my thing and no matter how different work I'll do, it will always be related to gaming and I feel I will not be able to break out of that niche in future if I wanted to.                           **Company B**: The next choice is to sign the offer letter of a ""BIG4"" but the project I will be working on is not directly related to big data. I will have 2 other team mates doing the same work. The company is huge and has all sorts of departments and great perks, and my mentor from company A says that it will help me grow in the long run. I have a few days to reply back to company B. The pay at this place will be about 15% more than at company A.                            I feel like I am still not happy with either of these options in front of me. I have always wanted to work at G or FB, but I am still waiting to hear back from them, and am unsure whether I will get an interview date soon since it is already winter vacation. Plus I have to reply B soon. Last year, I got to the hiring committee review at G but was denied because they ran out of space for more interns. :(                                           I'm a hard worker and I have secured these offers by trying really hard, and they were never easy for me. However, I am unsatisfied and unsure whether choosing one (either A or B) will look like a good decision in retrospect when it is summer. My heart lies at G and FB. My interest lies in Big data and I want to gear my career towards it. G and FB pay almost 20% more than B and almost 50% more than A. Money is not important to me at this point, but it would be a great help if I could secure G or FB.                              Has anyone been in such a situation before? Are there suggestions for me? I would like to hear if any college student has been through such thoughts before, and how they resolved it.             Thank You.";"Hi, I hope I'm not too late.  ***Disclaimer***: I was an intern at Riot Games in Summer of 2014. I now work full-time at a Big4 (may not be the same big4 you have an offer for, I'm at Amazon, but it's still 50% more than Riot Games, all compensation included).  I would *strongly*, ***strongly*** suggest you take the Big4 offer. The work doesn't *seem* nearly as glamorous, but Riot Games is not what it seems. Sure, it has more perks now (especially with the free food on the new campus), but **I would not recommend this place to anybody with a penchant for learning**, or anyone who wants to grow and learn to become a *good* software engineer. You say you're interested in ""big data"". ***That's awesome***. Take your passion elsewhere - Riot Games is **not** a ""big data"" company. They don't ***make*** ""data-informed decisions"". They've **already made decisions** for their release roadmap -- they just have to figure out how to phrase it as if the community wanted it to begin with. All four of the big4 (Amazon/Microsoft/Google/Facebook in terms of intern/new grad hires) companies have much better ""big data"" problems to solve - I can't think of a better place to be besides there.   ***Stay as far as you can from Riot Games if you want to become a better engineer***, especially if you're still in college / a fresh grad. If you're an experienced engineer and want to solve hard problems, you'll be ""*that smart guy in the room*"", which I didn't want to be when I graduated, so I chose somewhere else. **Yes**, it's an awesome internship experience. And **yes**, I'd totally go work there, *if I didn't have anywhere else to go*. But **you** have options. ***You*** have better places to be, ***especially*** since you have ambitions that don't include gaming (I do, but I still wouldn't recommend Riot Games for gamers - there are much better companies out there that do way cooler things). If you're big into the gaming culture, or buy into the idea that ""*Riot has a better reputation because it was on Glassdoor's greatest places to work, as well as praised all around for having a great culture*"", ***and have no other options when it comes to an internship***, then that's cool, go work there.   If you have further questions, ***please ask them here***, either as a reply, or as a PM. You can check my post history if you think I'm joking, or that I'm ""some random troll who has no idea what he's talking about"". I had the same ideas that you did, but after I finished my internship at Riot, I lost all respect for Riot in terms of ""would this be a good place to work after I graduated"", and immediately sought to work ***anywhere else*** because of how little I realized I could learn from those around me. Becoming a subject matter expert is awesome (you're going to do this wherever you go), but with so few **good** role models around you, it's ***so difficult*** to learn anything unless you're in an incredible awesome org, and there's only one right now (not my team, but they're also not looking for people... so...).#Sounds like you are working at RIOT. My friend did a RIOT internship in big data and then moved to Amazon.   I would just go with the bigger brand this time with more salary. You could worry about shifting teams later while you collect nice fat paychecks.#Choose B. Normally I'd say company A would be better because you are more interested in the subject. But you've decided you don't like the industry and you don't want to work there in the future. And it seems like internship programs get really good reputation by treating their interns very well. So I'm sure you'll get an interesting project.#If it was Amazon or Apple, then I would say go for B (especially if you are on the systems/services side). Microsoft though? I am not aware of anything interesting that they are doing with big data. Not compared to the many other companies in Silicon Valley.#Have you talked to the recruiter at B and requested a different project? Tell them that not working on big data is probably a deal breaker for you and ask if they can do anything about it."
socialmedia;3v43lo;1449040341.0;/r/socialmedia/comments/3v43lo/social_media_as_a_job_whats_next/;Social media as a job – what's next?;I work full time as a social media editor. I love it, but it recently struck me that, as a relatively new career path, I have no idea what the long-term career strategy is. I wondered what thoughts from the community were about this?Where do you plan on taking your career in social media?How will the industry develop? Will the focus be on big data analytics or creative content development?How does it compare to the career path of traditional marketing, PR or journalism?  ;"As someone who started working in social media around 2004, you better like the agency life. You will either be working for, or with one for as long as you decide to follow this path.  I moved from social community management to social analytics, digital analytics and now am head of analytics for a marketing agency... and should be working, not pissing around on reddit. #This post really resonates with me. I'm 19 years old and currently in an apprenticeship doing Digital Marketing. I'm constantly though questioning where next? I enjoy a lot more of the Social Media side of things rather than monitoring data pools for email sends. It's simply coming down to the fact that I need a clear direction but this career path, in my opinion, is fairly ambiguous.#I worked on social media (content, measurement, planning, paid, etc.) at agencies for five years and have transitioned into a more marketing-focused role in-house.   From my perspective social spans PR, Marketing, Adv, and Corp Comms which means the career trajectory can vary widely. In my case, I was really strong with technology/analytics and utilized my social experience to dive further into growthhacking and marketing automation.   Overall, social media skills (business focused skills, that is) really translate well to marketing, but it is a hurdle to go from social at an agency to in-house marketing because most in marketing associate social with top-of-the-funnel lead generation as opposed to stronger conversion.   I'd be curious to see where others have ended up after starting/spending time doing social... I bet it varies widely based upon the individual. #Unless you go to a very big company, there isn't a ton of room for growth within social media itself. The best path at smaller companies is to expand to other digital marketing positions and ones that include cross-functionality of multiple digital marketing aspects.  Within an agency you may have the ability to expand to driving social strategy for clients rather than being in the weeds writing messages and posting updates. Same is true on the company side where there are growing numbers of positions to help design social strategy and how it fits into the overall digital marketing mix and helps to support your other sales/marketing/etc efforts across the entire company.  Going the route with a company/brand rather than an agency is going to offer more opportunities and higher pay. Agencies top out fairly quickly and you have to be willing to jump from agency to agency in most cases.#likely to social strategy, then digital marketing, then overall marketing (social, digital, communications, etc)#I've always envisioned doing social media management and marketing work for some time and then transitioning to a kind of ""director of digital marketing"" for a big company as an end goal. It just makes sense because of the experience and skills you would learn by practicing SMM for years.#I've been in some form of social media since 2007 when it was just beginning to get big online. I've been wanting out of it as it feels like it gets a bit repetitive and it can be (is) an ALWAYS ON CALL type of job. I've gone from agencies to an in house social media manager for a more business to business type gig in an effort to get away from the agency life but there really isn't much upward movement at my current position and I'd imagine outside of agencies in general it's a bit more limited unless you're at a huge corporation with a large marketing team ... or a smaller one that requires taking on multiple roles (and often a big pay cut.)  I would recommend having some diverse marketing skills beyond social media - especially if interested in a specific field.   I'd imagine we can expand into more digital marketing, PR, content creation, writing, etc.. It just gets a bit hard the higher up you go in the experience levels since those positions often look for a wider  or very specific skill set.   It's actually kind of frustrating. WHERE do we go when we can't bring ourselves to learn about and really don't care about the next hot social media network that the kidz are into? #I've worked in two Digital Marketing agencies and now an SEO Contractor / Freelancer.  Some people love being a ""jack of all trades"" while other's are pretty stoked at being the ""expert"" and go to guy in one specific discipline.  From my personal experience, the director of the two agencies always looked for people with a broad set of skills in digital marketing (link building, local seo, enterprise seo, content development, social etc).  It's funny though because soon after they hired that person, they'd find out the ONE thing they were best at, encouraged them to take courses, learn more and more about that ONE thing and become the expert and go to guy for that specific type of marketing.  So even though my directors hired people with a broad set of skills, they preferred each of us to only work on one technique (ie. social media).  I'd say if you want to climb the ranks, I'd take advantage of any in house training, job shadowing, udemy and keep you eye on groupon's for other courses relating to all disciples in digital marketing.  I did that and here I am starting my own SEO agency, offering a full range of digital marketing services."
statistics;3vewfe;1449235939.0;/r/statistics/comments/3vewfe/i_am_interested_in_big_data_so_what_should_i/;I am interested in big data, so what should i focus on?;Hello, i am a student who study the secound year on the Statistics and Data analysis programme, which is 3 years, and on my last year i have room for extra courses, so i can basically choose whatever course i want (within data mining, data analysis etc.)I have studied R, SaS enterprises and databases. So my question to you guys is, what program is most used in handling big data? Or is there different theories and methods?;"The term ""big data"" is sort of a catch-all buzz word for a really wide variety of research areas, from genomics to social networks.  The methodologies are very diverse and there are all kinds of interesting things to work on.  Are there any specific topic areas that appeal to you?  That might be a good place to start focusing your studies.  My own suggestions are very much based on my background, and others might disagree.    First, I'd recommend getting familiar with python.  Keep up your R chops, but forget about spending any more time with SAS.  I'd also recommend picking up some machine learning expertise and some background in variable selection procedures.  (The latter in particular is very important for working with large data sets.)  Lastly, I'd suggest getting familiar with methods for handling missing data, and some basic background in causal inference.  (The two topics kind of go hand-in-hand.)  You'll probably end up encountering a lot of very messy data sets, and you'll want to have some tools to help get you out of trouble.  Good luck!#Since the majority of your time in a job would likely be spent on finding/cleaning data and (potentially) automating your models, I'd say anything that gets really hands on with bad data and then some CS classes.  I never had the opportunity to take CS classes during my PhD so I learn on the fly/take online courses for them now.#Python, R, SQL, Spark #What do you mean by *big data*? The narrow definition is ""data that won't fit on one computer"". This is actually still pretty rare, so I'm assuming you use the term *big data* to refer to what was until recently called applied statistics.  If so, don't focus on a specific program, work on fundamentals instead. Logistic regression is logistic regression whether you do it in SAS, R, SPSS, Python, or Julia. You most likely will need SQL and some basic knowledge of programming, but more important is exposure to key CS concepts like asymptotic complexity and basic algorithms.#Do all the exercises at www.SQLzoo.net to build up your confidence in SQL.   I swear to good it will be time very well invested if there's even the smallest chance you end up working with data. #CS#Take a look at Drew Conway's data science Venn diagram.  http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram#Honestly - I work in Big Data and I really wish I knew Java better. It's the foundation of MapReduce and even Scala runs on the JVM so that means Spark  also has lots of Java.  Also my shitty software dev skills means I suck at automating tools in Python and so on.  I wrote a custom reducer for Hive in AWK last week though, that was pretty sweet.#C/C++, Java, map Redoop, HIVE, PIG, SQL. duhh"
msp;3x1onm;1450245441.0;/r/msp/comments/3x1onm/client_wants_their_data_on_the_cloud/;Client wants their data on the cloud;"Hey MSP,I have a client who has about 10TB of data and wants to move it ""off site"". I am a new MSP so I dont have a colo and my office has a slow 10/1 connection, so it's out of the question.They have a drobo 5n in RAID 5 but are worried that if the drobo crashes, then they lose their data. Makes sense, so we setup Crashplan Proe and started moving their data to the cloud. At the rate of about 3-7 Mbps, it's gonna take about a year to complete lol. They are asking for a faster solution but I dont know what to provide. They dont have a server, just a bunch of workstations. They are a design company so dont have or need a domain and work with Macs. I wanted to put a synology on their end, copy the data from the drobo to it, then put another synology, copy the data to it as well, take the second synology to my office (or a friend's colo space) and just replicate it. I started researching Storagecraft after searching this sub but I cant figure out what's the best way to approach this. I feel like this is going to be a huge market as well - moving big data to the cloud - and want to find a good way of making this work.";"So some of this depends on what we're really talking about.  It's 10 TB, but is that a relatively small number of huge files, or a very large number of small files?  How often are those files updated?  When they say they want to ""move it off-site"", does it need to be moved, or just copied?  Are they looking to remove equipment that's onsite, or do they just want a backup?  Do they want it ""in the cloud"" because they expect to access it remotely, or do they just want it out of their office?  Does the data all need to be updated, or is some of it archival?  Not having answers, I can tell you that 10TB is unfortunately of a size where lots of things are going to break.  CrashPlan doesn't handle that volume of data well.  Any service with a 2-way sync is going to have trouble keeping up with changes, and it takes time just to rescan 10 TB and see what has changed.  So first, I'd look for non-technical solutions.  Do they really need all of that data, or is some of it made up of people's iTunes libraries, or videos they downloaded from Bittorrent, or what?  Lots of businesses that I've dealt with, even if it's all legitimate data, they may be keeping 20 copies of the same files for no good reason.  Or there may be old files that they don't actually *need* to keep.  So get rid of what you can.  Next, look to see if some of it can be archived.  Do they have files from 8 years ago that nobody uses, but they're keeping just in case?  Find a place to store that stuff, e.g. dump it to a hard drive, make a couple of copies of that hard drive, and store the copies in different places.  Something like that.#Huh, it looks like Crashplan used to have a seed service. You'd pay $125, get shipped a 1TB HDD, fill it up, then mail it back. I'd try contacting them to see if you can work something like that out. It doesn't seem to be available anymore. #Is this really just for archival data?  If so, Amazon Glacier with one of their seeding devices is the way to go.#Sounds like archive to me.   Have them move expired project data.   Archive that to a separate device, or glacier.   Then see how much data you really have to actively backup.   I'd bet their active project data is less than 1tb.#""Client wants their data in the cloud"" or ""client wants their data off-site""?  With that much data, and depending on the rate of change, you might be better off with a service that will physically come and pick up your backup devices on a regular basis and store them in a secure facility, instead of trying to send it out over the WAN.#Have you thought about AWS? https://aws.amazon.com/importexport/pricing/  There are some huge benefits when you use S3 along with versioning and lifecycle(moving to glacier after a set period of time).  #What you need is an offsite solution that will allow you to send them a physical seed of the data.  Datto does this with Roundtrip drives, but trying to get 10TB of data backed up would be insanely expensive. I think this is going to be the route you're going to have to go though, you'll definitely want an onsite backup and an offsite. If the offsite solution you choose allows seeding of data, then you can backup the data to a local device and ship them the backup data.#Crashplan, I believe has the option where they send you a blank drive, you copy your data onto it, then send it to them. Once it's up you just sync the changes since the copy job.#Can you clarify- does your client want a cloud File Server type solution or do you just want a cloud backup?#I wonder why they have 10TB of data and no real serious infrastructure.  Most companies that get to that point realize that they have a serious need that needs some serious investment and thought.  The hard part about 10TB, wherever it is, is that it is hard to backup, move, restore, or pretty much do anything with monolithically.  Are they just looking to move offsite for backups or for access as well?  In any case, you may have to try to logically break up that data.  Also, get them off of the Drobo, that is just asking for it.  They need real hardware.  Anyone running 10TB of data in RAID 5 is walking a really thin line.#If it's archive/dr type stuff - look into Xilocore.  I've had nothing but good experiences with them and they are well worth the per-gig cost."
datascience;3w8nlf;1449764373.0;/r/datascience/comments/3w8nlf/coursera_data_science_specializations_john/;Coursera Data Science Specializations - John Hopkins Data Sci vs. UCSD Big Data;"Disclaimer - I don't have a formal CS degree but learned programming through grad school (data analytics in social science) and an immersion program. And yes - a thoughtful Reddit user informed me I left off the ""S"" on Johns in the title. Amended below though :-) .I've been work as a platform dev for approx 18 months writing a blend of Python and Java code. Most of my work focuses on picking up data from third party APIs, sticking it into our data pipeline, and pulling it out with Python to serve up for our web app after it's been fed into the various MapReduce jobs we have to format the data into the shape we need. What do I want to do in the future?I want to understand how to build models to derive insights from data, knowing how to clean it, work with data at scale, identify holes in data sets, and essentially work efficiently with data. With a background in social science research I'm inclined towards working in a space where non-profit meets data, but I'm comfortable working within the more traditional technical space provided it's within the realms of ""data engineering"" (as I understand it).What I'm trying to do -Outside of networking, finding folks in the community who do work I may be interested in, I want to pursue learning to help fill in the gaps. I may (mostly likely) invest in another grad program down the line once I've defined my career goals more specifically. MOOC therefore provide an attractive option for me.Johns Hopkins Data Sci specialization and the UCSD Big Data specialization are two course listings that pop out to me. It appears to me the former may be more academically minded whereas the latter is more professional minded. True or not, I'm at a crossroads as to which one to pursue. I have a strong background in Python and have worked in R - not caring for it entirely. The JH track is R only and most reviews say the content is quite introductory at best. Does anyone have any insight for what may be better? I'm not looking to move into the academic space but wish to use the specialization to help me in professional development.";There's an extremely high likelihood that someone did not take both courses, because once they completed one -- they moved on and started doing projects or deeper learning.  I'd ask for feedback from people who've taken the courses themselves and try to make an informed decision.  With that said, when I started looking for jobs a few months ago, I had 109 interviews in 2 months. Not a single person asked me what specific courses I took (my resume does have quantitative and programming skills on there), not a single one asked what papers I wrote nor published in grad school. You know what every one asked: Tell me about/Walk me through one of your favorite projects.  Talking about the data collection, the cleaning, the modeling, the relationship building, and the implentation...that's what people care about. People always want to know How does what you've done apply to me? How does it make my team better or more efficient? How can you help solve our problems?  Classes are a decent foundation, but they won't give you a job. You spend a quarter of your time learning new things on the job anyways.   My advice, watch a few videos from each. Figure out which learning style helps things stick more and take the course. Then find a pet project or kaggle competition that interests you and go to town.#I would also look at the Portilla course on Udemy. There is probably a code floating around for $10-20. Would build off of your Python background. #I've commented on the JHU specialization in other threads. The short version I'll write here is that it seems directed at beginner programmers who want to capitalize on the boom in big data hiring. I doubt you'd get much out of it.  The statistical inference class is pretty good if you haven't taken stats before. The videos are very theoretical, which is good if you want to get into academia.  Otherwise, it's mostly how to do a lot of different things in R.#Commenting on the JHU course:  Targeted at beginners definitely. Depending on how easily you can switch between languages, the r programming course may or may not be worth it.   Reading your post, I would recommend: R programming course (don't pay for it) Getting and cleaning data (don't pay for it)  Those two will give you a super quick crash course in R. You can probably knock them out in a week or two if motivated.   For taking it to the next level: Statistical inference. Depending on your comfort level and familiarity with stats - this will set the stage for a lot of basic knowledge you'll be applying later on.   Machine learning. Again, the goal is to get a 10,000 foot overview of the techniques and mentality. You will get more direction on how to accomplish a task.   The other classes aren't bad - but depending on how familiar you are with git, general analytical mentality and visualizing data - they may not add much immediate value.  #*Johns (it was his mother's maiden name)#one looks more expensive.#[deleted]

cscareerquestions;3uy5hu;1448939972.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3uy5hu/apple_or_amazon/;Apple or Amazon?;I'm having a hard time deciding between the two offers. Maybe someone here can offer some help. Which job would you choose?My compare and contrast of the two jobs. Just me thinking out loud, feel free to ignore what's below, or point out where I'm wrong if you do read it.Apple job is doing embedded systems. Low level, C/C++ programming, which is what my background is in. Got the feel that it would be a good place to develop my technical skills. Amazon job is more about distributed systems, services and big data. All in Java. Which is very trendy right now. Feel like something that's good to learn about and would enable me to develop some good business understanding of things.Both are in tech centers. Apple in Bay Area, Amazon in Seattle. Seattle has the advantage of lower taxes, COL and generally better living conditions. From what I hear, I prefer Seattle as a city to live in. And I could picture myself living in Seattle long term, not the case for Bay Area.Know little about work life balance in Apple. Amazon doesn't have a good reputation here. I want to take a job where I feel I can keep working there for a long time without burning out. On this aspect, I feel Apple is slightly better.In terms of future career progression, I feel either job would be fairly good. I feel Amazon is better in that the skills developed there is more general, so could be used in lots of other roles at other companies. Where the technical skills I can develop at Apple would be very good for future roles in low level development.They offer fairly even amounts in term of money. Apple is better when it comes to benefits. Amazon is not too bad after considering COL and taxes.;"Both offers seem pretty good for you. It's honestly hard to tell you which one to go for, as I think you'll do well in both. How are the teams for the two companies? Can you leverage your offers to negotiate a higher compensation at one of these companies? Maybe these two factors can sway your decision.#They're actually very similar once you go below the surface: secretive/introspective, with a cult of management/personality centering around the God Emperor CEO (though perhaps much less so for Apple now that Jobs is gone--maybe Jony Ive is that person now; dunno). Of course, that sort of culture also leads to excessive working hours (in general), and both companies are known for it, in truth, though there are sizable pockets of sanity in both. You just don't hear as much about Apple because...lawyers? Stronger cult mentality? Stronger sense of work purpose/fulfillment? It actually does suck less in other ways that count? Can't say for sure.  As a company, Amazon (+AWS) is very much on the rise at the moment; Apple is stagnating a bit and may well have peaked without their God Emperor. These things can change, of course--Apple was approaching death twenty years ago and Amazon didn't really exist in any meaningful way. Now they're bigger (in terms of revenue, at least) than just about everybody else on the planet.  So, really, it comes down to the city you prefer and the direction you want to take your career in with respect to skills/tech stack/domain. All else is trivial.  P.S. I worked at Amazon for a few years and actually did like it quite a bit, but there was nothing about the greater company that inspired me to make a career of it. My team was a senior-laden group in R&D and I was an experienced (mid-level) hire with a lot of visibility into what I was getting into--so on a personal level, I did cool stuff and got paid well for it, with decent hours. College hires who get blindly shunted off to shit teams that are supporting legacy code, a brutal on-call rotation, and a pointy-haired first line manager with something to prove generate most of the horror stories. Plus those poor saps in the warehouses, though I hear they still pay a hell of a lot better than Wal-Mart. Good luck!#Depends on which specific team you are joining on Amazon. The general consensus is that it's either very good or very bad.#My SO interned at Apple last summer. He enjoyed the work, but the culture wasn't for him. It was all very secretive and he had a lot of issues with that - being in the Bay Area, you'll likely want to go to conferences or workshops or hackathons and Apple frowns on that (at least at the internship level). He was also working around 50 hours a week because his manager was crazy and super high pressure (he has a lot of issues with his manager, as did other FTEs on his team but that's another story...). He felt that you really have to be passionate about the work because of this culture. But his roommates loved working at Apple and are going back, so he thinks he just got unlucky.#depends on whether you want to go into embedded#Seem pretty even overall. Have you considered what would be best for your family?"

As a programmer I know every programming language has at least one function to return the current time, which you get from the clock. You don't have to think about it. There will also be a bunch of functions, like is X closer than Y, and ways to save a time stamp. Now most devices have a location (rather than they take up a whole location/room). There are some common functions to get the location. On my Android phone I often have multiple GPS-focused apps running (GPS Essentials for checking signal and recording a track; Keypad Mapper 3 for recording OSM data; Mapillary for instead recording photo sequences) but they all have to get the location from Android separately, and they decide to do this at different rates. Oddly this will result in different levels of detail in the recordings from them and a lot of battery charge taken by the processing from it. Devices will realise everything wants to know the location, so it will be focused on efficently providing the location, in a form that all the apps understand.#You might poke around in the materials from the two editions of this event: http://www.geography2050.org#**Also note: The point of this is sort of to look at changes predicted to happen in the future, and then show how Geography can play a critical role in those changes. Also, full disclosure, I am creating this infographic as a class assignment, but I also just think the finished product would be a great addition to the community. I'm just looking for more ideas and maybe some extra sources I can look in to!#[deleted]#Remote sensing. Better, cheaper, bigger, quicker data allowing for active monitoring of the planet."

How would giving them exponentially more hay make them able to find the needle better?I became curious... Could having *more* raw data unintuitively make the data easier to analyze?  Wouldn't it make outliers and extremes stick out more, and trends more apparent?  I only work with structured data so I am conceptually unfamiliar with big data analysis. Cheers!;Yeah! Read up on semi-supervised learning. The basic idea is large amounts of unlabeled data (not sure what you mean by unstructured) data helps you understand and model the distribution of data. That then informs your modeling of the labels of the thing you do care about.#It is also true that many forms of data both structured and unstructured are very sparse.  So more data can clearly help when you are trying to get enough cases that connect two or more sparse events.#I've always wondered how much low level regulation there is in the tools the CIA/NSA/etc can use. I work in credit ratings and we're constrained from using anything other than logistic regression for most credit scoring models due to regulations surrounding documentation. So, while a neural net or other machine learning method might work for our application we can't actually use it. I wonder if they have the same problem.

I'd love to learn it to be able to sufficiently analyse big data sets.Thanks!;"The mailing list is extremely helpful if you know the basics.#If you are new to programming then learning the basics of programming in general is important.   There are resources on Coursera and other places that teach a lot of how to use R, and Google can help you find what libraries you need to download/functions to use for different types of regressions/hypothesis testing.  The best way to learn how to write code is to write code. Grab some data sets you might want and do some tests.  R is a pretty nice language to start out with, with the whole ""user to programmer"" or whatever the whole philosophy was behind it. You can do most of what you want with very intuitive syntax and start to do more and more complex stuff as you become more proficient.  Getting an R kernel for Jupyter would be a good place to start getting yourself set up.  One thing you'll want to keep in mind if you are dealing with large data sets is to look into preallocation of memory. I know when I first started using R I sat for like 10 hours for my code to run because I was an idiot and forgot to preallocate.#I'm learning R right now too.

So really my question is, how should I handle letting my current employer know that I'm looking into this other opportunity since they'll be interviewed? Should I notify them before hand or go the its better to ask for forgiveness than permission route?;I agree with the other comment. Keep this to yourself until you know they are going to interview your manager. I would also list someone else you work with that you trust as the interviewee instead of your direct manager. Once your manager finds out, it will be very awkward and/or you will be at risk for losing your current role. #You should notify your manager if they are going to interview them, otherwise you should tell no one. Telling your employer you're interviewing somewhere else and only staying at your current job because of forced waiting period is the equivalent to telling your employer that you're no longer an asset and that you should be terminated as soon as possible.  Unless this is one of those rare places that actually helps people advance their careers regardless of where they work, talking about going to work at other employers is not a good idea and should only be done when you're ready to leave immediately.  #You're in an enviable position, but as others have noted I would stay mum for now until you have greater insight into the security clearance process and are solidly down that road.
bigdata;3w7zpn;1449754491.0;/r/bigdata/comments/3w7zpn/big_data_and_the_hype_played_on/;Big Data: And the hype played on;;As someone who reads a LOT of big data articles- and call me biased working for a Big Data analytics company- this has to be one of the most unfounded, nonsensical, poorly justified, and tragic articles I think I've ever read. This sounds more like an uneducated rant than a realistic case against Big Data hype (which I think most will agree exists on some scale). I would encourage the author to spend more time seeking to understand the applications of big data, contrasting previous solutions to current, and making note of decisions that are made on this 'fad' of big data and the impact of those decisions on both the business and human world at large. Since the writer self-professes they are neither actively nor passively involved in any big data projects- I would hardly consider them a valuable contributor to the conversation. #Another vapid rant from the Big Data Contrarian.  Once again you fail to back up your claims with anything resembling evidence.  Perhaps you don't see  any success stories because you aren't actually looking for any.#In spite of the best-efforts of Hadoop evangelists, consulting houses, and IT infrastructure and service vendors, Big Data – hailed as the greatest thing since the dawn of greatest things – is failing, and dramatically so, to produce the necessarily corresponding quantity and quality of tangible, detailed and verifiable success-stories.

statistics;3vy9ey;1449594857.0;/r/statistics/comments/3vy9ey/learning_methods_appropriate_for_enormous_samples/;Learning Methods appropriate for Enormous Samples (Big Data);"I think I'm going to make two separate posts for slightly related topics - please forgive that.  I was trying to write them in a single post before and it was too long and convoluted.I'm a first year Master's student interested in Big Data (I know it's a buzzword - bear with me). There were a variety of reasons I chose my school, but I knew going in a weakness in the program would be preparing me for the big data trend, so I know I need to learn what I want regarding ""big data"" on my own.I remember reading a thread on here quite some time back about how ""typical methods"" of model building become difficult with enormous data sets - in short my understanding at the time was that because the standard error of parameter estimates becomes so small in that case variable selection down to a more practical size becomes a challenge, although I guess you have the opportunity for high predictive power if model complexity isn't a concern.  I'm sure that's just one of many considerations as sample size gets dramatically large.In short, I just want to start learning about how to deal with data that has over a million observations, for example, since that's such a different beast from what I've been exposed to so far with class projects ranging from about 100-10,000 observations.Any resource suggestions are appreciated, but I guess I'm wondering about book recommendations in particular.  I don't necessarily want a proof-heavy textbook, but I also worry that most of the results from a ""big data"" search on Amazon are aimed at people with much less statistics background than me.  I guess I'm hoping to find something that does have an applied focus (I guess some theory thrown in is fine) but isn't simplified down to just intro stats level.Any suggestions?";"*Introduction to Data Mining* by Tan, Steinbach, and Kumar is pretty good. It covers a ton of different methods of analysis, from cleaning and anomaly detection to pattern analysis, visualization, and clustering.  On a related note, big data is usually in reference to datasets that are so large that they cannot be analyzed on a single computer. So, a million rows usually doesn't make the cut, unless you've also got a ton of columns. If you want to learn how to handle big data, you should look into the programming side of things too, like MapReduce and Hadoop. I personally don't know enough about those to give you any reading materials, but they are important to learn. #There is a course being taught at my school about the ""Mathematics of Massive Data Analysis"" and the prof presents everything in the framework of spectral graph theory. We focussed a lot on using the Graph Laplacian to develop standard ideas in data analysis like clustering, k-means, etc.   According to him, a good book on this topic does not really exist, because a lot of this material is still in the literature.   Edit: I should say we didn't really talk about HOW to implement a lot of these solutions, but we really understood the basis for the method. If you want a good practical resource, try one of the Coursera/edX courses! "

I'm taking 6 months off work, how do I utilize my time most effectively?;As the title says, I'm looking to make a bit of a career change so I'm taking time off work (I can return if I want and I have savings, my safety net is good) to study and I want to use my time efficiently and build a portfolio towards a specific entry point. I'm interested in big data analysis and machine learning, I know I'm likely not going to get a job directly doing this after 6 months of study, but I would like to at least get something that could build towards that as a career, not some webdev job doing ruby or whatever those bootcamps are doing nowadays. Can anyone offer any guidance for how I should be using my time in regards to this?;What's wrong with webdev in Ruby? I'm as real a programmer as they come and that's my current position. I also work with a bootcamp guy who's a fantastic programmer. Don't knock it until you've tried it.#I'm bored of network engineering at 43 and I'm not sure I could find interest and spark if I was working somewhere else.  First network installed in 1990, CCIE-R/S in 2000, JNCIE-SP in 2011... I have lost interest in furthering/maintaining that knowledge base where I'm working now because the requirements have drifted far away from what experience I brought with me.    I have also found myself in my first ever operations role and that is proving to be a poor fit.  I wonder if I should get myself out of operations before deciding my next growth step.  I'm spending more time trying to get the tools and automation to work in my hack corner case - and hounding the ones responsible for fixing them.  It has turned into BS.   I think it is all about where you work and whether you're doing enough that interests you.  I'm trying to change that while leveraging my considerable networking experience and ability.  I'm looking to switch teams where I currently work because I'm vesting RSUs that were priced when the stock was 40% of what it is trading at today and I believe that they'll train me to fill in my gaps...  The trick is to get them to keep my pay at a senior network engineer level while I come in as less than senior in the new position.  TLDR:  It may be your job that's boring, not network engineering itself.  Try finding something that leverages your existing knowledge and experience.

Basically, im building a high power workstation as i personaly run quiet a few VMs and other things. My plan is to build this new machine a little earlier than expected and then just move my parents from mac to Windows using VMs. Ive done my research and found this shouldnt be an issue for what they do, the issue i have is the amount of data i need to store. Between me and my parents there is about 20-25 TB of data that needs to be storred. I want to know what the best way to do this might be. I had a thought about maybe having another machine that has the horsepower to host that much data and just have the two machines connected via a 10g link so there is no bottleneck of a 1g network. I want to know your guys opinions because it is quiet alot of data to be stored.I know the first thing you are all thinking, there has to be some data that can be deleted lower the spce requirements, the problem is we have already done that. My main concern is my prents data as most of mine isnt important and can be downloaded again if need be. My internet connection doesnt allow me to have stuff stored in the cloud (Yay for Aussie internet) and my parents really only use photo editing tools and occasional video editing.I want to know peoples opinions on both of my solutions (The one high powered station with the VMs on it connected by 10g to the other solution which is a high power storage server).Thanks in advanced.;That amount of data isn't an issue as long as you get large enough hard drives to hold it (plus whatever you need for redundancy). Lots of people on this sub have setups that hold well over that size.  Not really sure I understand your application. What are you running the VMs on? Are you actually doing big data applications, or is the data not operated on often?

However, I recently came upon another job opportunity for a smaller firm who's focus is in security, big data analytics, and sigint on government contracts. I interviewed and loved the company and the work I'll be doing, and got a contingent offer. It is contingent on passing the proper security clearances, this could take anywhere from 6 to 14 months. As part of the clearance process my current manager will likely be interviewed.  I am continuing to work at my current place of employment until I pass my clearances(I plan to stay here if my clearances don't go through) and haven't told them yet.  So really my question is, how should I handle letting my current employer know that I'm looking into this other opportunity since they'll be interviewed? Should I notify them before hand or go the its better to ask for forgiveness than permission route?;

MachineLearning;3v7gec;1449097014.0;/r/MachineLearning/comments/3v7gec/question_how_does_the_given_algorithm_incorporate/;[question] How does the given algorithm incorporate machine learning techniques??? (no code included, but there is a description);"   For a report (the final, big report we have in our ""big data"" class at my uni), we had to use Hadoop with a machine learning algorithm of our choice (random forest, L-SVM, etc). He had provided code for what he calls ""random forest with hadoop,"" and we were essentially supposed to simply modify this code to run with our dataset, and compare it to a version of the same code that doesn't incorporate Hadoop.    That being said, he gave us some R code with a mapreduce call in it and said basically, ""here is random forest with Hadoop, compare with a Hadoop-less version."" Since the class is moreso about Hadoop and HDFS than machine learning, I can't exactly tell whether this code actually does what random forest does. Without posting the code itself (afraid of copyright issues since it's in his textbook), I want to describe what some of this code does.    Random Forest (mapper):The mapper seems to be creating two bootstrap samples, combining them with rbind(), assigning the bootstrap sample index to the key and the combined samples themselves as the val.   RF (reducer): The reducer is where the code takes one feature--specified by the coder--and compares each entry in the  feature against the feature mean, assigning a class to that feature (either a 0 or 1 for his example), which I have modified to a feature in question for my dataset, and introduced one more possible class. The original feature values are then replaced with their assigned classes, and... That's it.    The rest of the code: The rest of the code is mine, and is only for the purpose of debugging: it takes the output, compares those assigned classes against the actual classes, and calculates ""information gain.""    The bootstrap samples are never used anywhere else in his code, no bagging is apparent, only one feature is used, and the metric by which that feature is classified is hard-coded and, seemingly, specific to that particular example dataset. No ""trees"" are made, and there is certainly no vote tally function for said trees' outputs.    The code that performs this function isn't supposed to be some incomplete ""fill-in-the-blanks"" type of situation  rather, it's straight out of a textbook he wrote on the subject that he is using as an example of code for random forest, to help describe how it works. I'm at a loss--I don't understand how this at all accomplishes what random forest is supposed to accomplish, seeing as there is no ""training, validation, and testing""--the algorithm simply uses mapreduce to compare observation attributes against the feature mean.    His decision tree example seems to be ridden with manual coder-specified decisions as well, such as a mapper with comments like   ""#split needed on left side""    (code)    ""#split not needed on the right side""    (code)      Shouldn't these algorithms be doing that work for me? (Thereby making the algorithms themselves much more complex?) When I use a package like Rpart, it generates a decision tree from my data, with little else to go on that I specify!    Once again, sorry for my ineptitude, I am not a machine learning programmer, though I *would* like to learn how these approaches work, instead of scratching my head at how a couple of manual comparisons qualify as ML. Tl dr: My professor gave us code for ""machine learning"" (random forest, decision tree) with hadoop that is suspiciously riddled with manually made decisions about the data/no apparent tree/forest structure (though I am not a machine learning programmer, so my scrutiny is nil).Edit: tldr, formatting    Edit 2: I realized that the bootstrapping code was actually making multiple bootstrap samples, but the code just isn't going any further with them.";Yes

The operating system: Windows NT 4.0. At the time I was studying to get my MCSE and was working on the Workstation certification, so I was chock full of knowledge of the inner workings of Windows. So that you understand my state of mind later on in this story, I include the following information: I was also in my early twenties, single, shy, and not very good with women, at least in my mind. I found out later on that I actually had plenty of women interested in me (and amazing ones at that!) I just missed all the signs.The job was at a local company, doing second tier helpdesk – if a problem cropped up that the first tier helpdesk couldn’t resolve, I’d jump in and fix it. As the company was kind of largish, there were two of us on tier two. The other guy... Well, there’s a stereotype we're all familiar with of the unwashed pimply-faced nerd with no social skills and bad halitosis, and he was the epitome. He’d been with the company for some time before I was brought in, as the sole T2 tech support person. I didn’t immediately dislike him, but I didn’t feel an exact inclination to befriend him either. I’ll call him the PFY for now.I was sitting at my desk one day when the PFY got a phone call. It’s our boss, asking him to come take a look at something. Almost immediately after he left, a new ticket gets assigned to T2, showing probable user profile corruption. We used roaming profiles, and profile corruption happened occasionally, generally when somebody’s profile grew too big for the local computer hard drive to hold it. This happened, and more than you’d think – the hard drives we had were pretty dinky, and there were some big data files in use at the company. Also, with multiple users logging to a single system in you could run out of disk space pretty quickly. The location is customer service, and so I head on down there.Customer service was actual physical customer service at the time. People would come in, pay a bill, ask questions, do research, the kind of thing that we all do on the phone now. It was staffed almost exclusively by very attractive young ladies, the kind that turned my blood into this effervescent fizzy water and made English into my second language. I found the desk, and looked into her eyes.""Her"", in this case, was an absolutely stunning slender (but not too slender – I’m not Sir Mixalot, but I don’t like famine victims either) natural redhead with green eyes that tended to show up at work about the same time I did. Long curls of orange fire tumbled down her back, sometimes loose, sometimes braided, always gorgeous. She dressed conservatively, flats, a slightly below the knee skirt, and a cute blouse every day I saw her. She always turned left when I turned right once we got inside the building, and I had yet to work up the gumption to say anything to her. Had events gone differently, I probably wouldn’t have ever gotten around to saying anything ever anyways. I’d be lying if I claimed I’d never had any indecent thoughts, but I had it drilled into me from a young age: You don’t crap where you eat, and you don’t date where you work.I swallowed my fear (it’s a lot easier when you have an excuse to talk to someone – in this case, a trouble ticket) and jumped in valiantly. ""Hello, I hear you’re having a profile issue. Do you have a few minutes to fix it?"" She smiled, and as my breakfast leapt into my throat, said ""Yeah, that would be great! Are you new here? I haven’t seen you before."" I sat down at the keyboard and started to fix the profile issue I let her know I’d just started about a month prior and was enjoying the work.As I started the cleanup, I noticed something weird - The usual signs of profile corruption (a full C: drive) were not present. In addition, she was the only person who logged into that computer, and her profile was actually pretty small. I said, ""Huh, that’s strange"" not out of any particular reason, but because I tend to talk to myself when I’m working on computers. She volunteered that the issue actually happened to her all the time, and seemed to happen in her department three to four times a week.Something didn’t smell right to me. I’d never gotten a ticket from the service pool in the month I’d been there. I’m not sure what twigged me, but something made me scratch my head and say ""hmm."" I repaired her profile, then on a hunch enabled file level logging of her profile directory. I told her I’d fixed the issue and I’d taken a further step to see if I could figure out what was causing the issue. If she experienced it again, she could go ahead and submit a ticket, but also to email me and let me know that it had happened, and I’d take a look at the logs to see what had popped up.About two weeks later right after I arrived at work an email from her popped up in my inbox. About the same time, PFY left the room for parts unknown. I went ahead and did a remote view of her event log. There was a lot of garbage (enable file level logging on a person’s user profile sometime, it’s horrible) but I did find one gem in there:\\computer\c$\Documents and Settings\gingerhottie\ntuser.dat deleted by PFY at 6:33AMDid anybody NOT see that coming? (After all, I did title the story ""The Creeper"") For the less technically inclined, the PFY had been going into her computer via the network and deleting a key file from her profile, causing it to barf all over the place and require reconfiguration. He’d grab the tickets when she logged them and then go down and ""fix"" the issue he’d created in the first place. I suspected he’d been doing it to all the women down there.Sure enough, I found a bunch of tickets under his name that were about the same ""profile corruption"" issue. I brought it to the attention of my boss, things got rolling, and that was the PFY’s last day. I never even saw him again – he got paged away from the customer service desk, and was escorted out of the building. I was told to go down to her desk and fix the issue in a polite and professional manner, which I did. I was also told in no uncertain terms that I wasn’t allowed to breathe a word about this to anybody, which I haven't outside of close friends, until now.That should have been the end of it, but it wasn’t.";"> That should have been the end of it, but it wasn’t.  Argh, ZE SUSPENSE! EET EEZ KILLING ME!  But seriously, good job spotting that and actually making the connection...#> I found out later on that I actually had plenty of women interested in me (and amazing ones at that!) I just missed all the signs.  Are you me? Worst thing so far was (back in school) when I told my mum that two friends had started dating and she answered ""Didn't you know she's into you?""

Thoughts on the 4-to-14 window and faith like a child.;"**Debate Topic Overview:** ***4/14 Window, Should we be evangelizing youth, and Faith Like a Child***Overwhelmingly, if you look at evangelism/conversion numbers for Christianity, you will see that [the vast majority come from people ages 4-14](https://home.snu.edu/~hculbert/ages.gif). Christian studies have shown that this 4 to 14 time window is the time that 83-85% (depending on the study) of Christians converted during their lifetime. Further, children ages 5-13 were shown to have a 32% chance at converting, whereas youths 14-18 only have a 4% probability of doing so.[This website](https://home.snu.edu/~hculbert/ages.htm) details the Nazarene survey results to that effect (of which a similar survey conducted by the International Bible Society showed almost idential results), this website is literally [www.4to14window.com](http://4to14window.com/), and [the Barna Group did similar research back in 2004](https://www.barna.org/barna-update/5-barna-update/196-evangelism-is-most-effective-among-kids#.Vi58RX6rRhE). It's no secret that the church makes a massive effort to have children and the youth involved, and that they usually have their own special classes, camps, focuses, events and trips. I saw many friends convert to Christianity in this golden 4-14 window, but it didn't seem coercive or sinister for churches to hit those age groups hard until I found a pile of research on the topic years after college. Further, all research I've done on the topic online seems to focus on this research meaning we should evangelize people from 4-14 *harder* and use it as the window of opportunity it's shown to be. That doesn't seem to jive with me, organized religion using big data to be opportunistic in preying on children (that they hope to be future members).**So, all that said, my main debate point or question is:**   **1)**  Is it ethical to proselytize children, KNOWING that they're highly susceptible to influence during their developmental age window?  **2)** If Christianity really is the pure, saving grace that claims it's based in reality, critical thought, and exegesis, whyis it still pushed so hard on the youth, and not presented when they are older? At that point, they will have more developed critical thinking skills and can make their own binding and legal decisions. **Opening Thoughts:**It seems like if Christianity is the unassailable salvation that it's touted as, that it should be something that's able to be presented logically and convincingly to adults, to great effect. Targeting children and using data points to isolate exactly when they're most vulnerable to become a member of your religious group is something that would be hailed as despicable by Christians if they saw another religion do it, yet it is a beyond common and widespread occurrence for churches to do. When I questioned several church officials along this line in the past, they cite that the adults do not have ""faith like children"", as was so often quoted to me when I had doubts about a very doubtable religion. Children do have amazing faith which can be admired, but it's also a very vulnerable faith which is why they are also convinced to believe in Santa, the Tooth Fairy, and any number of things. Hearing that the same type of faith needed for believing in Santa is the type of faith that adult Christians should have is very, very offputting.";"You have to realize that Christians believe what they're teaching their children is true. If you assume that this is their motivation then I see no problem with this. You (and I) only have a problem with it because we disagree with Christians. I personally would rather people teach religion once they hit the age of reason but that's a personal preference - parents will always teach their culture to their children.#I have a real hard time with this question. It appeals to a myth of neutrality in education and child rearing that just isn't possible to achieve. All of our individual perspectives of the world contain *tons* of axiomatic belief structures that we can't help but pass along with our children.  This is especially true when you consider the blindly obvious fact (if you have kids anyway) that our children learn far more the example of our lives than the words we say.     Our family is Christian. It's in the air we breath, its who we are, its the very center of our home - and I couldn't keep from ""evangelizing"" them if i wanted to.    Consider such a scenario: I get a call that one of my parents have died. Heartbroken, I now have to tell my 4 kids that their grandparent has died. Of course, they are devastated and have questions. Should my response be to tell them what I believe about a future hope of resurrection, and to take them in my arms and pray with them and for our family? Or, should my response be to say ""kids... I'm sorry but none of you are old enough to be evangelized, please leave the room so your mother and I can pray as consenting adults.""?  So sorry to disappoint, but that is not the approach I'll be taking.   I tell my kids all the time, ""you are Christian because you're ours, plain and simple. But there will come a day when you will have to decide for yourself what is true...you don't get to ride mommy and daddy's faith forever, at some point you're going to have to accept it as your own or reject it."" I make it clear to them that I will love them whatever they choose to believe, and we're very honest about discussing the reasons a lot of people don't believe and how those people are pretty much just like us, trying to make the best sense of the world as they can.  But at the same time, I don't lay it out like one worldview doesn't make better sense than another, because I obviously *do* believe one perspective of the world is better than the other, and *I can't help but* lead them and teach them accordingly. #By ""should we,"" do you mean to ask a question on ethics?  We need to frame this up a bit and understand what moral duties, responsibilities, and rights parents have in regards to their own offspring.  Do parents have the right to teach their children as fact things that they sincerely believe are true or do parents have some grander epistemic sort of obligations to only teach these things once they have fulfilled some reasonable epistemic duty?#I don't think so. that's just my personal opinion but if you're a christian, you should be given that right to raise your child that way. I mean, we have some great muslims, christians. Its not entirely immoral unless you are teaching them to hate everyone else.#I think u/SsurebreC summed up my own opinion fairly well.   There is one thing I'd like to point out about the studies you cited. The reason so many Christians ""Convert"" between 4-14 is because they were raised in the church and within a Christian nuclear family. These people have less hard and fast moments of conversion. People older than 14 who are exposed to Christianity for the first time are most likely people raised outside of the church in non-christian families. They thus have a much lower rate of conversion.  #Is it ok to teach children history, math or the scientific method?#Where in all of your research does the fact fit that the vast majority of Christianity -- Catholicism, Orthodoxy and mainline Protestantism -- doesn't have conversionism as a main theme, as Evangelical Christianity does?#Parents are de facto verbally and non-verbally teaching and training their child from day 1.  Even if you made every reasonable effort to avoid ""recruiting"" your child to Christianity, the *influence* of the parent's Christian faith on their character and decisions that they make would still be highly influential on the child.  It is a farce to think the child could be somehow shielded from it.#Ideally, you would focus on teaching a child critical thinking skills and give them the tools to discover the truth, but to some extent, when kids are too young for that message, we have to teach them some things without them figuring it out themselves.  I have no intention of teaching my sons about religions until they are older and have a more functioning bullshit detector.  But on he other hand, I'm already teaching my oldest cool stuff about animals, the moon, rainbows etc.  I hope he'll get older and care about the how we know things, and that I can instill a how do we know that attitude.    I don't think religious people are indoctrinating their children out of a bad place.  They (at least most) aren't purposefully teaching their kids about their religions because they know it's garbage and their kids won't buy it if they wait too long.  But I do think that if something is really true, then give your kid the tools to think critically and your beliefs are true, they should stand the scrutiny.#The question you're asking is it okay to teach your child. For every parent that'd be different. An atheist would most likely produce an atheist child, and a Christian would most likely produce a Christian child.   This goes for everything (political leanings, etc.)#> 1) Is it ethical to proselytize children, KNOWING that they're highly susceptible to influence during their developmental age window?  Is it ethical to teach children what you think is right and wrong?  > If Christianity really is the pure, saving grace that claims it's based in reality, critical thought, and exegesis, why is it still pushed so hard on the youth, and not presented when they are older? At that point, they will have more developed critical thinking skills and can make their own binding and legal decisions.  What binding and legal decisions do you think we're tricking children into making?#>1) Is it ethical to proselytize children, KNOWING that they're highly susceptible to influence during their developmental age window?  If I believe that what I'm teaching them is right, wouldn't it be actually morally wrong to withhold the truth from them?   If I think that them learning about Christianity is as important for their well-being as learning how to behave in society, as learning that eating food and drinking water is important for their body - am I not actually *obliged* to teach them about Christianity?  >2) If Christianity really is the pure, saving grace that claims it's based in reality, critical thought, and exegesis, why is it still pushed so hard on the youth, and not presented when they are older? At that point, they will have more developed critical thinking skills and can make their own binding and legal decisions.  What if I believe that if they'll die without believing in Christianity, they'll go to hell? Am I not, again, *obliged* to tell them about it?   Generally - what's the point in waiting when it comes to delivering an important message? If I think that stealing or hurting others being wrong is self-evident, based in reality etc - why shouldn't I wait with teaching children about this until they've developed critical thinking skills either?#The way I see it, parents have a moral duty to provide the best education for their children. That means that if the parent thinks that teaching them Christianity is the best thing, that's what they should teach them. I have a further objection to your argument. Let's suppose that the parent decides to wait and see what their child chooses. This doesn't solve the problem. Remember your premise, young children are essentially sponges, they will absorb whatever they come into contact with. If the parents don't teach their kids Christianity, they'll pick up whatever they come into contact with. Leaving the development of your child to chance seems even worse in my opinion.   #This is a great post, as it gets at something usually washed over because it's still socially normative in most societies, but for outsiders, shows some of the immense power and privilege religion as an idea has over other ideologies.  I would think any person convinced of a religion through its evidence and reasoning would be appalled by the fact that childhood indoctrination is how the vast majority of members come to their faith.  Also not brought up but equally important, the social pressure and benefits of remaining a believer once you enter adulthood.  If someone truly believes their belief system is superior, it should make them think twice that most people are indoctrinated into it, and we don't see wild swings in changes in belief as would be expected among a population of these questions were considered on they merit except in those places where childhood indoctrination into religion is fading."

talesfromtechsupport;3pjn24;1445375379.0;/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3pjn24/thats_just_not_going_to_work/;That's just not going to work...;We have a hadoop cluster. HDFS is the hadoop filesystem. A few things you need to know - it's a distributed filesystem over lots of linux boxes, each of which has lots of local disk. Each block of data that's written gets written three times to different hosts to provide high availability, so if one host goes down, you still have 2 other copies available to you. Hadoop and HDFS work best with relatively few really large files. Lots of small files are not great. This is, after all, big data, not lots of little data.One other thing - quotas are set on directories. So, if you say, limit the /stuff directory to 40,000 files then it won't let you write more that 40,000 files or directories under that structure.  You might, as in our case, also limit a particular subdirectory, such as /stuff/application, to 20,000 files. That way, when that application tries to write more than 20,000 files, only it is affected, not everyone who uses the /stuff directory.  I wonder why we might have had to institute that limit for that application...So we get a request in from the developers to increase the /stuff/application directory to 7,000,000 files. Yes. 7 Million. We look, and they are currently using 12 of their 20,000.So we ask why they want such a huge increase, and remind them that hadoop/hdfs doesn't do so well with lots of small files.  They say it's just the way their application is written, plus the increased volume of work, means that they need that number of files in order to do everything as parallel as possible.  They ask> Can you please explain the problem with 7,000,000 files?I explain, once again, that in hadoop, low number of large files is good, and a high number of small files is bad.I then go on:> in HDFS, our block size is 128M. That means that if a file is 1 byte, it takes up 128M of disk space. If a file is 128M plus one byte, it takes up two 128M blocks. > so, 7,000,000 files takes up 7,000,000 128M blocks. That's 854 Terabytes. Then each block is replicated 3 times. That's 2.5 Petabytes. That's the minimum, regardless of how big the actual files are.> This hadoop cluster has a total capacity of 330 Terabytes, so 7 million files simply won't fit by close to 3 orders of magnitude.> And that's before we even look at performance. We haven't heard back.;You want to store 7 million files?  Ok, we're looking at about $2 to 4 million just for the storage. Then we can start talking about the servers that will host that storage.  Then we can talk about the interconnect infrastructure.  By the time we get done it may cost upwards of $5 millilion.

The 5400 RPM hard drive which will effect load times, but that's bearable imo. The 950 GTX as opposed to something more powerful.   Medium range at best imo.#What's the price of this machine?

cscareerquestions;3rae29;1446512105.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3rae29/nervousness_after_first_day_at_work_general/;Nervousness after first day at work.. general questions..;Hi all,So today was my first day at work. Felt great, I naturally woke up on time and survived a few hours without caffeine, so morning felt naturally nice.I am joining a highly specialised team, and everyone in my team is atleast a decade older than me with years ( not 4-5, way more) kick ass experience in their fields. They are veterans in those areas. Its awesome, but at the same time a little odd that I am the only new grad in my team. I mean they know I am right out of college, so I wasnt hired by mistake or anything. Still, I feel I dont know what expectations they will have? Everyone was amazingly nice though. My lunch with them... they were talking about family/kids/backyards..so basically mid forties kinda stuff (now dont bash me for saying mid-forties. Its just to give you an idea). They noticed me (25) obviously cannot meaningfully contribute, so they shifted the topic towards newer things like games, big data, and general stuff where I am from. Which was super nice of them...But still wondering, is this a good thing or a bad thing..Do you feel any special advantage of having co-workers around your age? Does that make a better cultural fit in anyway? ;"It's good. You've just surrounded yourself with some incredibly talented people.    It's fun to work with people you can connect with. Age is a very small factor in that. Place in life is also a small factor in that. They're factors, but take advantage of what you have and hang out with friends/go to dev meetups/whatever outside of work :) just be happy you work with nice people who will teach you a lot!#[deleted]#It's nice to have coworkers your own age for camaraderie. But the older ones are the ones that can teach you the most. Some of each is good.#It is as good a thing as you make of it. :)  The important thing is your attitude towards it.  Obviously, in an ideal world, there will be great diversity within all age groups within a team.  That doesn't always happen.  In your case, that was really nice of them to shift the subject.  But you can also learn a lot from your coworkers professionally and socially.  I've learned so much about my industry and career field from older coworkers, as well as random things like child care, parenting, lawn care (!), house hunting (!!), retirement funding (!!!!).    To be able to receive the most benefit of your situation is to be engaged, asked questions (about work related and non-work related).  Be a good sport about ""before your time jokes.""  Be confident in what you know, but humble with what you don't know.  Be gracious of advice offered, but don't be afraid to voice your own opinions.  Show a genuine interest in learning what they know.#All that matter is if they are cool and will teach you things. if not, bail.#Those older vets usually love teaching people who are excited to learn, and they'll probably live vicariously through your stories.  I'm 26 and everyone I work with is just a bit over 30 with wives and kids and they love hearing about tinder.    It obviously depends on the people but I enjoy it.  Not bad unless they're curmudgeons and unhappy.  As the new guy remember to respect their time and Google the shit out of questions before you ask them.  But also don't take hours stuck on something you know they know.  It's  a bit of a balance but you'll get a feel for it.#I'm starting my new job in a month and I'll be the youngest at 20 (will be 21 when I start tho) and I didn't feel too weird about it. Everyone was super nice, but they did threat me like a kid. They're super talented so I hope to learn a lot from them."

Research2. Internship3. Side projects4. Class projects5. Class material (taking topics like parallel programming, big data, ML, NLP, etc)I'm just wondering how I should best spend my time. I'm assuming internships can only be done over the summer, so what else can I do over the semester that will be most beneficial?;Internships are important and research helps as well. From what I've seen side projects help more than class projects, especially when they're live. Class material is not very relevant.#1. Good, but not necessary. 2. Probably the most important thing on the resume. 3. If your resume makes it past the recruiter/HR this becomes a very nice thing to have. Engineers love looking at your side projects as it shows experience, competency, and interest in what you are doing. 4. Can take the place of an internship if you don't have any internship experience, but internships are still more valuable. 5. I list my topics in a multi-column bulleted list on my resume. I think it's valuable as it gets you through many keyword filters that HR might have.  I've had pretty good luck with my resume format. Here's what my resume looks like (related work experience is computer repair for me since that's what I did in high school and college during the year): https://i.imgur.com/B6PhGDi.png#GPA is important as well.

cscareerquestions;3pksmm;1445392455.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3pksmm/should_i_quit_my_job_at_big4/;Should I quit my job at Big4?;Hi guys, I know this question probably has been asked million times, so sorry in advance, but I'd really appreciate your help. For the last 3+ years I have been working at Big4 company in Greater Seattle Area and lately I totally hate it. I feel like I am not developing the new skills and the stack is not attractive to me (I am willing to switch to newer and better technologies, preferably in big data domain). Turns out, with my current job it's not easy to do, as I feel really demotivated and tired. At first considered common strategy - preparing for the interviews in the evenings and then trying to switch the jobs, but the thing is, it's really hard to do that when you feel exhausted after days of annoying and not fulfilling job. So right now, I am looking for some advice how to deal with this situation. Should I stay? Should I join some bootcamp to change stack? How to motivate myself? I am leaning towards quitting, learning for a couple of months and then applying for other jobs, but I am afraid that I won't be able to find something decent. So in a sense, I am stuck. Any advice on that? Thanks.;>Should I stay?  No. I'm pretty sure a Big4 company would let you move around internally, but if the issues can't be solved by a simple stack & department change, it's time for you to leave.  > Should I join some bootcamp to change stack?   I understand being exhausted after work, but I have a hard time believing you can't carve out 4 or more hours a week to work on interview skills & maybe an easy side project in the stack you're interested in. I would never leave a job without having one lining up, but that's me. If you think you need a bootcamp, it's your time and your money.  > How to motivate myself?  I am afraid that I won't be able to find something decent.   Write down all the reasons you currently hate your job. Hang that list on your door so you can see it every morning when you leave for work. Use that list as a litmus for any other companies you interview with. You should be asking yourself if the new place solves most of the issues you left the big4 company. #yea, I'll take it off your hands for you... Obviously it's amazon, so you should know that amazon works people hard on mostly shitty stacks unless you get lucky coming in. I say switch jobs, there's a ton of companies in seattle that would be willing to have you, namely qualtrics, zillow, etc.#[deleted]

Python and R are recommended languages for me to learn, so I want to take a class or two at UW to learn these.Of these classes, which would you recommend I take? Have you heard anything about CSE 160?Thanks ;I'm a medium-data researcher whose formal CS education consists of a single undergraduate science/engineering C++ class. It was probably the most valuable course I ever took, even though I haven't used C++ since.  Getting a formal introduction to data types and structures, logic, functions, objects, and program flow will give you a set of tools that will apply to any other language you're likely to use.  R is something you'll pick up in a stats class along the way, and it will be even easier to learn R once you've become experienced with a general-purpose programming language.  EDIT: [relevant](https://xkcd.com/1513/)#Genome 373 is a good python based intro class for this kind of thing#142 is java, so that might not be what you're looking for. I would suggest learning languages yourself. Python is fairly simple compared to some other languages and definitely doable.

Everything works - if I pass the data in in chunks, and execute small queries.I'm running on a laptop with 4GB of RAM and an Athalon A6 processor at 1.7 GHz. If I try to run the whole dataset at once, it runs for about 5 minutes, then says it doesn't have enough memory (or the database is too big).I have 13 linked tables, ranging from 100-ish MB up to 511 MB. I'm thinking Access isn't the best tool for this, and I know that Excel isn't (row limit is about 1/11th of my largest file).What (software) should I be using? I don't run reports with this level of data very often (maybe once a quarter), but I'd like to be able to take less than 8 hours when I do run them. The cost of a dedicated computer for these reports is not justifiable. So - what are my options?EDIT: I'm currently loading data into a MySQL instance. My tables are ISAM, my data is being chunked into 1M lines prior to import, and (so far) it's going well. Thanks for the advice, all!";Find a computer on which you can install MySQL or MS SQL (you will need SOME money to upgrade memory and hard disk, but that amounts to a few $Hundred$) or use an existing MySQL/SQL server.  Your DBA can likely give you your own Schema to work from they will only manage for space reasons.......  This way you can work on the data more sanely.  If you are lucky enough to get on an MS SQL server, there are tools to migrate your current data  #Can you run a single node Hadoop and let it run in batch processing?#If you're stuck for options then it's worth trying xampp.   You'll get a mysql database and a few options for running app: apache & PHP, or Java. If you know python it will play nicely there too.   If you structure your app correctly, you might be able to work your way through the data without running out of memory. If you go this route feel free to send any questions.

Among its already-existing governmental customers, IBM explained, was the ISR Task Force.  >Although buried in reams of corporate management gobbledygook (IBM, it turns out, is “Mission Focused” and “Performance Driven”), the talk’s key theme was that IBM was offering prospective new government clients its “expertise in integrating business and technology services” using its “commercial consulting methods.” That is, IBM was bringing what it had learned from managing Big Data for corporate America to the military and intelligence worlds.  >Keep that in mind as you examine the secret ISR study, and you’ll see that the Pentagon’s drone program uses data analytics in almost precisely the same way IBM encourages corporations to use it to track customers. The only significant difference comes at the very end of the drone process, when the customer is killed.

Transhuman;3p1gk1;1445030380.0;/r/Transhuman/comments/3p1gk1/self_study_need_help_developing_curriculum/;Self Study - Need Help Developing Curriculum;"Hello everybody, I am new to the community but I've been interested in transhumanism for about two years now. I am starting to study computer science in my own time, as out of the ""four pillar"" technologies (computer science, neurobiology, nanotechnology, genetics) computer science seems to be the easiest to manage without access to specialized equipment. The problem is I do not know really where to start.I have limited knowledge about computers, big data, machine learning, AI, etc. so I was wondering if anybody in the community could help me put together a basic curriculum for myself. I'd like to know what my knowledge base should be to start out with so I can learn the basics and start to develop an understanding of exactly where I want to take my studies.Any help at all would be very helpful and appreciated.";"The problem is that three of those four are specializations within a field.  As a physics student myself I wouldn't discourage anyone from studying those subjects, but just be warned that you're in for an enormous amount of work for a rather lengthy period of time.  First, computer science.  You need to understand, first and foremost, that CS is not just programming and technology, it's an abstract and theoretical science.  It's an applied math field.  The kind of math you'll want to study is the ""discrete"" path.  That is, intro finite mathematics -> linear algebra -> combinatorics and mathematical logic -> number theory, abstract algebra, and calculus of finite differences.  Subfields like machine learning, data analysis (for which you will also need statistics), computer graphics, etc, all build on that mathematical base.  I strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with the C language (it's hard, but the kind of hard that makes you smarter) and a scientific language like MATLAB (this will cost you about $100), GNU Octave, or Python.  Second, neurobiology.  You will need a solid grounding in chemistry, up to advanced organic chemistry and chemical kinetics, and cell biology.   You will also need physics up to electricity and magnetism (typically the second or third semester).  You will also need the traditional calculus sequence up to differential equations of a single variable.  Genetics is one of the primary subfields of biology.  Most universities that offer biology degrees offer specialization in genetics, and they typically will make their curricula publicly viewable.  Finally, nanotech.  This is where it gets really, really messy.  You will need physics up to relativistic quantum field theory (typically a graduate-level subject).  That is, general physics -> wave motion -> modern physics (intro special relativity, intro nuclear physics, intro quantum mechanics all rolled into one just utterly delightful semester) -> classical mechanics + electricity (the advanced sequence) -> optics + magnetism + statistical thermo -> intro quantum mechanics + special relativity -> condensed matter physics -> relativistic quantum field theory.  Mathematically, you will need the entire calculus sequence, followed by the entire differential equations sequence up to differential equations of multiple variables and complex analysis, along with the entire algebra sequence (linear algebra, one or two semesters' worth of modern algebra), differential geometry, Fourier analysis, integral transforms, statistics, functional analysis, topology, numerical analysis, and proof writing.  You will need chemistry up through organic chemistry, chemical kinetics, and physical chemistry.   This is where mastering a scientific computing language like MATLAB will come in most useful.  If you're just starting college or thinking about attending, I would strongly suggest concentrating in a dual program consisting of two fundamental sciences.  Pick two among math, physics, chemistry, and biology.  CS is a fairly self-teachable subject these days, anyone can sign up for a CS class on Coursera and learn as much as you would like.  Expect to spend 5 years on your degree rather than the typical 4, and plan for graduate school.  Speaking of Coursera, I would also highly recommend signing up for Massive Open Online Course platforms like Coursera and edx and staying on top of possibly interesting courses.  What I would suggest doing, if you're certain you want to start ASAP (which you should, as this whole path will most likely take you many years), is getting your hands on some good college freshman level textbooks on calculus, physics, and chemistry.  Coursera routinely has relevant modules open in those areas.  I also suggest signing up for a forum like Physics Forums and participating in conversations, since trying to learn entirely on your own is unproductive at best and dangerous at worst.  I hope that helps you.  Best of luck.#It really depends on what your motivation is.  I got a really broad (but not deep) understanding of computer science by changing my major so many times (programming, engineering, routing protocols, and probably a few things I forgot).  Having a good working understanding of how computers work from the logic-gate level all the way up to the OSI stack and a basic understanding of routing protocols is something I value.   But now, as a person with a 10 year old child, I try to stay up on technology trends so that the knowledge and wisdom I pass on to her remains relevant.    If you're just looking to be an educated member of the transhumanist community rather than pushing the technology forward, I'd recommend starting with rationality and transhumanist philosophy.  I suggest reading Bostrom and Yudkowsky especially. Kurzweil I find frustrating, but it's worth knowing what he says since a lot of people who know nothing else have heard of him and you'll probably want to be able to talk about him.      I'd also recommend a literature component to your studies.  Look into transhumanist fiction.  Examining other people's views can help you develop your own.    None of this is to say studying pure science isn't worth it in it's own right, but I don't feel like my Differential Equations classes made me a better transhumanist.    And here's a few links just in case you haven't come across them:  http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html  http://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/simplified/  http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences  http://hpmor.com/#Learn lab and practical skills for molecular biology, neurophysiology, electronics, CNC equipment, chemistry. Access to specialized equipment is not always necessary, for example see the at-home biology people (diybio) who have managed to hack together basic, calibrated equipment. Seek and find good mentors that possess the skills and similar results to what you're aiming for. Avoid LW because their goals are more like rationality commenting and AI xrisk prevention through fiction, which is somewhat not the same as transhumanist technology goals."

Stuck with Mainframe and some generic SQL/Shell Script/Autosys work and want to get out. How? Where?;"As the title suggests, I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science and I'M working in the US primarily as a Mainframe developer. I've been working for an Indian ""IT"" company for about 6 years now and the ""client"" I'm working for has a bit of Mainframe maintenance work and I also fill in as a ""generic"" resource to work on some basic SQL/ShellScripts/Autosys jobs kinda work.All the work that I do is repetitive - as in things break and I have to look at the logs/whatever and try to fix it. It's one of those jobs where you reach a certain point after which everything seems ""more of the same"". I get paid $65k a year and I'm on the East Coast.After giving it much thought (and being quite lazy about it too) I've finally decided that I've had enough and I'm planning to move on. I'm hoping I will at the very least increase my yearly salary if not anything else. However in an ideal world, I want to get away from being tagged as a mainframe developer but I wouldn't know what else to pursue. I'm no good in Java/Python/ETL tools/a lot of the other ""hot trends"" like Big Data/Hadoop etc. Which one of java/python/C++ or some ETL tools or something else would help me sell myself to a hiring manager? Or is there a completely different option which I've obviously not thought of, that is better in terms of my career?";"You can escape. You have my sympathies, I was in your shoes several years ago.  I like /u/billibus_maximus 's advice. Playing to your strengths is a good thing and a transitional job would be perfect.  If you can't find this kind of work, another straightforward path out is to learn Python or Ruby for back-end web development (i.e. Django or Rails). You can claim that you *really* understand databases, unlike these kids that don't know what the ORM is doing ;) A basic way to make yourself hire-able:  * If you can get away with it (don't ask just do), start scripting some things in Python or Ruby at work. The languages both have a very friendly learning curve. * Once you know the basics, set aside some time and work through some Django/Rails tutorials at home. * Build two or three personal web-apps that you can show off to a hiring manager. Anything simple, an expenses tracker, an exercise planner, an app to list and rate the books you are reading or want to read. Put them live somewhere and link to them on your CV/cover letter.  This will still take a lot of work, but unless you do something nobody will ever tap you on the shoulder and give you a better job. Sadly many companies are happy to let your skills rot until you are completely unemployable elsewhere.  See also on this theme https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/09/how-to-be-awesome/#Just as the other comment said, big companies are looking for mainframe developers. When I went in for my interview at american express the interviewer looked at my resume and saw that I had mainframe experience and asked me about it. He said that he was looking for mainframe people who work in COBOL and that he was paying good money for these positions. I think youre undervaluing your skills."

Apple should buy a university and rebuild it from the ground up.In recent years, some private equity firms have bought universities and turned them into for-profits. Apple is a for-profit corporation not a charity but there are plenty of ways to make money from a non-profit university. Aside from the tax breaks and other deductions, Apple University would be a proving ground for educational technologies that would be sold to every other university in the world. New textbooks built for the iPad and its successors would greatly increase the demand for iPads. Apple-designed courses built using online technologies, a.i. tutors, and virtual reality experimental worlds could become the leading form of education worldwide. Big data analytics from Apple University textbooks and courses would lead to new and better ways of teaching. As a new university, Apple could experiment with new ways of organizing degrees and departments and certifying knowledge. Campuses in Delhi, Seoul, Shanghai, Berlin, and Sao Paulo could provide opportunities for studying abroad. Apple’s reputation would attract top students, especially, for example, if it started with a design and business school. Top students would lead Apple University to be highly ranked. The more prestigious Apple University became the greater would be the demand for Apple University educational products.Apple already has the beginning of this model with iTunes U and its own internal Apple University for training in business and design. By buying a university, Apple would commit to a learning process to develop these technologies in entirely new ways.Sounds great, huh?;This is a bad idea for multiple reasons, not the least of which is that for profit universities are generally seen as scams. Moreover, they recruit top talent from (the best) already existing schools so they dont have a shortage of workers. And also, I seriously doubt that the Return on capital would be worth the costs. I think they should use their funds for innovation and growth.#The dumbest thing I've heard all week, and there was a debate on last night.#[deleted]

I will have to use MCMC methods, and it's initially expected that it will be done in R.However, since I already know how to program in python a bit, I was wondering how the PyMC packages compare to R's MCMC packages? I know Python is the big thing in science, it's got great libraries that probably can't really be surpassed in many areas, however I ask this because frankly, I don't know a huge amount about MCMC and Bayesian analysis, I'm going to have to learn it as I go. So I'm not yet able to decide whether I should start learning R or if Python would be perfectly fine for most cases.Sorry if it's in the wrong board, wasn't sure if I should post to learnpython or here.;In my opinion, Pymc 3 is best in class for MCMC bayesian modeling.  Its easier to use, has more samplers and is more flexible to extend than R's stan.  It also allows you to manipulate DAGs, which stan doesn't do...and in python. Whereas stan you have to do write string of a wierd C++ dsl.  Python is also faster in general, and you can get up to almost C speeds with the Numba compiler: https://github.com/numba/numba   Useful for writing your own samplers.   Here are some Pymc resources:  https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/getting_started/  http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2014/03/17/bayesian-glms-3/ https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/hierarchical/  Keep in mind the blogpost is a bit old, so there are probably syntax changes.   #[deleted]
personalfinance;3qha3a;1445983932.0;/r/personalfinance/comments/3qha3a/help_evaluating_job_offer/;Help Evaluating Job Offer;I currently work as a Software Engineer for a fortune 100 financial institution in Phoenix, AZ.  My currently salary is in the 55-65k range (using ranges for added anonymity) before yearly performance bonuses.  My current position is very comfy (read 100% job security until the day I retire) and has a very lax work/life balance.  I recently had an opportunity arise to interview for a ~10 year old tech/security government consulting company/start up (about 100 employees in size) in the Columbia/Elliot City, MD area and was fortunate to receive an offer.  This offer is for substantially more pay, in the higher end of the 80 - 90k range.  This consulting company seems like a dream place work, they work with emerging/bleeding edge tech, and seem to be very employee focused in terms of personal development and have a great work life balance too - probably not as relaxed as my current position.  I also currently live with my long-time SO, she currently works in a position outside of her degree field making ~35-40k a year, and however the job prospects for the field her degree is in is much better in Maryland.  I'm trying to make a decision on what is our best call here, we are very early in our careers and are all but fresh out of college.  Some pros and cons additional info about the offer and my current position:**Current Position*** Includes a fully funded pension upon retirement* Fairly easy to climb the corporate ladder pending you work hard, are polite and kind, and can handle some light office politics.* Would take 4-5 years to reach 85k at current company.* 401(k) match leaves much to be desired.  Will match up to $900, and automatically contributes $300 for a total of $1200 per year. 401k currently with Vanguard.* Work with some less than exciting tech, and deal with a lot of bureaucracy and red tape**New Position*** If I contribute 8% they’ll match 5% to 401(k) with T. Rowe Price* Would have to get my TS Security Clearance (very valuable in my field)* Much closer to home and friends SO and I grew up in this region* Work with Big Data/Cloud analytics and Security which is a quickly growing field in the tech industry, especially in the government sector.* Profit sharing in Employee Stock Ownership Plan targeted at 8% of employees compensation + bonus* Will pay for gym/health club memberships and activities up to a certain capBoth companies will be pay for tuition reimbursement however the new company will pay double what my current company will (I plan to seek my MBA in the future).  Other benefits are about equivalent but the new company’s Health insurance includes an HSA.  Sorry if my this was very jumbled, I'm very excited and anxious about this - what is everyone’s thoughts?  Thanks! ;Software engineer with TS here. Your salary is too low for a software engineer, even considering you are a new grad, take the new position. The TS will also give you a lot of job security.#Phoenix has a lot lower cost of living than MD, and a huge chunk of your extra salary would go towards increased living expenses (especially should you decide to buy a house)  Since you are young, and with that probably more willing to take risks, I would probably choose the new job. New jobs comes with higher risks, but also higher potential rewards.   If you were settled with house and kids, staying in PHX would be better.

You don't have to offer the whole enchilada, so to speak.   Ask yourself, who is your ideal customer and what is their biggest pain point they need help with? Can you create a product or one off service to address the issue? Or create a process that you manage but can outsource?   Break it all down and focus on one thing that they really need. Then create something that addresses this issue that can be replicated and possibly outsourced. A one and done deliverable that doesn't require your attention past the initial needs assessment and/or data dump.   For example, so many companies now are overwhelmed by all of their big data caches that executives can't make heads or tails of it. You can come in and take a portion of their data and do data visualization. By visually grouping together many data points, creating graphs and what not, they can now see the relationship between data points or figure what to focus on.  You can niche it down to doing this for a specific industry and/or customer type.   Or create a point of sale data collection system that in turn visualizes the data for small businesses and sell that. For example, a dry cleaner with this product will now be able to see at the click of a button each day, week or month, their hourly traffic flow, sales data, how many pieces per customer on average,  the geographical radius of their customers  (i.e they all live within a 1 mile radius, or live all over the place but work within a 10 minute walk) etc...   Mind you the above may be horrible ideas or outside your intended scope,  I don't know, they are simply off the top of my head examples used to illustrate my point. Finding that niche customer and/or product will take some trial and error. You have to go out there and ask potential customers questions and see who pays you at least, I dunno, what $100?, for whatever beta product you come up with and go from there. Develop it a little more with each new customer and continual feedback.#Your time clash concerns are spot on. It's an when-not-if that eventually your side business that is in the same space would begin to clash or overlap with your full time gig. Your boss and peers are likely smart people and will notice this.   I have about 15 direct reports, and if I caught any one of them conducting their own business on my company's time, my first thought is, well how much have they been getting away with that I haven't seen? Where do their priorities lie? They'd get a warning/ultimatum that day, and if it happens again, that would be it. This policy is spelled out explicitly in our company handbook as well.  If you really care about your job, tread carefully.#Several years ago I just dove off the cliff - I understand where you are at right now. Here's my advice...  I think your focused on the wrong problem. Finding people who are willing to pay you money is the challenge. Once you have figured out a reliable method for finding those people, what do you need the day job for?  You're presumably already an expert at the service you intend to provide/consult on. If you can also become an expert at marketing yourself and figuring out how to find paying customers, everything else can fall in to place.   Here's one dumb idea. Let's say you were going to generate leads through your website via PPC. You could use an appointment scheduling app, take advantage of time zone differences to schedule off hours for you (but on for the client), and then only market to that time zone.  So if you're on the East Coast, your calendar only allows for appointments between 5:00 and 9:00pm. You only market to the west coast, so you have availability between 2:00 and 6:00pm every day for new leads to book calls.    "

I was always the kid who loved planes, then I became the kid who fixed everyone's tech problems (mostly software-based, I never actually worked much with hardware but I definitely knew my way around figuring out if the problem was in the hardware or software, I just never wanted to void my warranties). I did always take it upon myself to fix things (though generally I was only permitted to mess with the technology because no one else in my family knew how to fix them), and as a young kid I designed stuff in my head, but I grew frustrated with being unable to draw my designs very well, so I turned to improving my communication skills so I could convey the ideas verbally. Now, after spending some time in school thinking about astrophysics and still occasionally thinking about robotics engineering, I've been pursing CS. I enjoy CS because I like watching my programs come to life, I love seeing a bunch of characters on a page suddenly become a beautiful entity. I've never been bad at math, but I've also not responded to the typical math teaching style of ""here is two hours worth of how to solve these specific equations but I'm not going to actually explain the thought process of how to solve problems."" I love creating, possibilities, and puzzles. To the best of my understanding, CS is the most fitting for this style of interest  that said, I'm not particularly interested in many of the more traditional CS puzzles. Making my own video games, software for meaningless drivel applications (Who really needs twitter. Like, why. What is the point?), these are the type of things that sound like the most boring, useless, meaningless wastes of a lifetime to me. Big data and cloud computing are one slight step up, but thoroughly uninspiring for me. I made my own website in HTML, which I'm still working on and I've actually enjoyed, but I've noticed a lot of the programming challenges interest me because of their novelty, in addition to the fact they're useful to me. Once I've solved the puzzles once and created the idea (of course you do have to fix all the bugs, which I also enjoy doing, that's part of solving the puzzle), I don't have any desire to do that puzzle again (in essence, I'm saying despite the fact I enjoyed making my own website, I don't think I would enjoy web development). The problem for me is I simply don't find programming *interesting.* I enjoy it, but I'm just not that interested in it. This is a major area of concern for me, because I'm aware that programming is a life-long learning process, and I don't know if I'd be interested enough to seek out new techniques and languages on my own time (unless as part of personal projects, which I do have several ideas for when I get some time).So, I've been doing a lot of soul searching. The best thing I've come up with is I believe I would enjoy combining my love of aircraft with my love of CS, to write programs for NASA or SpaceX or other Aerospace companies. I'm not *only* interested in aerospace, but to be perfectly frank I feel much more at home working with the engineers (at least at my school) than I feel working with the CS majors, and when I have thought about it in depth, I'd like to be the guy who does the programming end engineering. I reached this conclusion by, in the course of considering Robotics Engineering, considering what role I would like to be (or be most comfortable) in charge of if I were to participate in engineering competitions. I am a third year, but current plan is to get a BS in CS and minor in Astrophysics. UCSC doesn't have AE or ME  we only have EE, CE, Robitics Engineering (though to be fair, our RE is mostly just CE with a couple statics and dynamics classes attached), and CS.TL DRI think I have a pretty good idea of what I want to do (programming for engineering and preferably aerospace) but I don't know the best way to go for it.This, however, presents a few issues:1. I would think these are the types of jobs it's probably far more difficult to acquire?2. I'm more than willing to put in whatever effort in whatever field it takes me to get there, but I'm not sure if I'm even going in the correct direction. Am I correct that CS major and Astro minor would be most appropriate for getting a job programming for the Aerospace industry? I am considering a CE major with a programming emphasis as well, but I wasn't sure which would be more appropriate.3. Will I be unhappy with my choice to go for CS if I can't get a job in the Aerospace industry? Am I putting all my eggs in one basket? I wouldn't mind working with robots or programming other things, but I'm more interested in an engineering side of CS than a video game or silly useless app side of it. I want to be involved in concrete things that really matter, not one more bloody social media application or one more way for people to waste time or one more information collection service so companies can better target their adds... If I was stuck doing that for the rest of my life I don't even think I'd work in the software industry, I'd probably find a job doing something else and maybe write programs on my own time. I wouldn't mind doing menial software for an internship or two, I enjoy learning things the first time around, I just don't think I could do that as a career.";> 1. I would think these are the types of jobs it's probably far more difficult to acquire?  Not really. Aersospace (NG, LM, SpaceX, ULA, NASA, Airbus) are all huge and the industry is only going to grow.    >  I'm more than willing to put in whatever effort in whatever field it takes me to get there, but I'm not sure if I'm even going in the correct direction. Am I correct that CS major and Astro minor would be most appropriate for getting a job programming for the Aerospace industry? I am considering a CE major with a programming emphasis as well, but I wasn't sure which would be more appropriate  That's a good attitude to have. Although I can't speak for your minor, a CS major will help significantly. It sounds like you want to work more with embedded systems so I would encourage you to learn low level languages. Buy an RPi or Arduino and have some fun.   > 3.Will I be unhappy with my choice to go for CS if I can't get a job in the Aerospace industry? Am I putting all my eggs in one basket?  No telling man. Hell, you might get balls deep into an aerospace career and realize it's not for you. However, you have a good chance of getting into the industry so keep on trucking.   In the meantime, you need to be applying for every internship you can find in the industry. NASA Pathways program is a great way to start.

However, when we look at the implementation of an ANN, then we see that there is no term which defines how many data points we need to train on. In fact, one of the major parameters to tune are the regularization terms and the number of epochs (or iterations). Also, it has been shown that ANN are universal approximators, and they can learn functions like XOR using small data but enough epochs. So, building on that shouldn't it be possible for an ANN to learn using a small data set, of the order which is used by SVMs, Logistic Regressions (which can all be represented as ANN), e.g. 20k instances for binary sentiment analysis. What are some limitations of using ANN for small data, e.g. Iris data with ~100 instances, movie reviews data ~20k instances etc?Doesn't small data (Order of 1000) with 1000 times more epochs equals big data (Order of 10^6), when it comes to training neural networks? (In understand there is not going to be enough diversity in the smaller data compared to larger data);"In short no, because the DNN is seeing the same data over and over again. The reason why problems like iris and xor can be learnt with small amounts of data is because they are very simple. Complex functions, like mapping the pixels of an image to the number (MNIST) or sentiment analysis will need much more data in order to be learnt properly. Just think about the number of dimensions in the input space: iris has 3, xor has 2 and MNIST has images with 26x26 pixels. There is just a lot of possible values for the pixels that represent a given number, so you will need a lot of examples of that number. The same goes for words and more complex problems, and simply increasing the number of iterations won't do it.  The difference in complexity between SVMs and DNNs lies in the number of parameters. In the SVM you have the alpha coefficients, and there is one per example (although many are going to be 0), while in a DNN you will usually have many more (think about the huge weight matrices). Depending on the problem one is going to be better than the other.#To add to what /u/sk006 just said, you can't compensate for ""not enough data"" by training more and more. It is like watching the same mooc about neural networks over nd over again, hoping that at some point you will know what the history of religions is. You'd better watch the mooc about the history of religion once.  On the other hand, the opposite is also true. Having 1000 lectures about the same topic doesn't help more than 100 lectures. On the other hand, actively listening to them instead of playing video games at the back of the room will teach you stuff ;)  Hope the analogy helps.#The problem with a small dataset is overfitting.  In other words: You will learn *something* this way, but that something may not be what you want to learn. As you train over and over on the same data, your network will move more and more towards memorizing it rather than extracting useful generalizations. When you then try to apply your network to new test data, you'll get terrible results because your network basically only knows how to recognize an input and regurgitate the answer."

These people grow up surrounded by divorce. Most people I know now don't want to even get married because it feels frivolous. #I see a huge number of divorced people in this generation , even older generations due to seeking new partners online. My husbands dad did this 15 years ago so it's not a new concept.  I think it will be really interesting to see if the marriage rate actually goes down because more people have seen their parents, and friends marriages fail due to infidelity or financial difficulties.#I think marriage rates will just plummet to be fair.#**Attention!** Please keep in mind that the OP of this thread has chosen to mark this post with the **[Serious] replies only** tag, therefore [any replies that are jokes, puns, off-topic, or are otherwise non-contributory will be removed](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_--.5Bserious.5D_tags--).

Projects range from software development, app support, big data, QA, business intelligence, etc. From my experience (~2 years out of college now), some of my peers don't mind the constant shift in tech but others dread it (they'd like to focus on a certain tech stack for example).I do not have an affinity to any particular tech stacks (Microsoft, Oracle, Angular vs .NET, etc), but I do enjoy architecting and solving problems based on requirements and selecting the appropriate stack.My question is, what are your thoughts on tech consulting career prospects? I feel that my lack of time in a specific tech stack would hurt me if I applied to another job in the future, unless it would be another consultancy. What are the pros and cons of going this route over a more traditional  and dedicated dev role?;Assuming you can handle the up and down nature of rates, consulting isn't a bad gig ESPECIALLY if you are stack agnostic like you say.  Its a lot easier to get away with it on the Data/BI side than the front end side, but it is useful in both.  My personal style is to consult until I find a lot of cool problems to solve and then transition to FTE until they get under control.  You can always go back to being a consultant if you need to.

My currently salary is in the 55-65k range (using ranges for added anonymity) before yearly performance bonuses.  My current position is very comfy (read 100% job security until the day I retire) and has a very lax work/life balance.  I recently had an opportunity arise to interview for a ~10 year old tech/security government consulting company/start up (about 100 employees in size) in the Columbia/Elliot City, MD area and was fortunate to receive an offer.  This offer is for substantially more pay, in the higher end of the 80 - 90k range.  This consulting company seems like a dream place work, they work with emerging/bleeding edge tech, and seem to be very employee focused in terms of personal development and have a great work life balance too - probably not as relaxed as my current position.  I also currently live with my long-time SO, she currently works in a position outside of her degree field making ~35-40k a year, and however the job prospects for the field her degree is in is much better in Maryland.  I'm trying to make a decision on what is our best call here, we are very early in our careers and are all but fresh out of college.  Some pros and cons additional info about the offer and my current position:**Current Position*** Includes a fully funded pension upon retirement* Fairly easy to climb the corporate ladder pending you work hard, are polite and kind, and can handle some light office politics.* Would take 4-5 years to reach 85k at current company.* 401(k) match leaves much to be desired.  Will match up to $900, and automatically contributes $300 for a total of $1200 per year. 401k currently with Vanguard.* Work with some less than exciting tech, and deal with a lot of bureaucracy and red tape**New Position*** If I contribute 8% they’ll match 5% to 401(k) with T. Rowe Price* Would have to get my TS Security Clearance (very valuable in my field)* Much closer to home and friends SO and I grew up in this region* Work with Big Data/Cloud analytics and Security which is a quickly growing field in the tech industry, especially in the government sector.* Profit sharing in Employee Stock Ownership Plan targeted at 8% of employees compensation + bonus* Will pay for gym/health club memberships and activities up to a certain capBoth companies will be pay for tuition reimbursement however the new company will pay double what my current company will (I plan to seek my MBA in the future).  Other benefits are about equivalent but the new company’s Health insurance includes an HSA.  Sorry if my this was very jumbled, I'm very excited and anxious about this - what is everyone’s thoughts?

I am one of the associates of the company I work (Startup), which I started as an Intern 5 years ago.Also, I have developed the only [Open Source Google Play Store Scrapper](https://github.com/MarcelloLins/GooglePlayAppsCrawler) that fully works and allows for distributed scrapping of the Play Store. Oh, the database generated from this project is also ""open-source"" (public).I will be spending 21 days in Canada, so I wonder whether any startup from Reddit would be willing to open the doors to me for like one hour, so we can get to know each other, talk about things we could do together. Networking is always good :)I will be visiting Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, so any startup within those cities would be good to me. Thanks for your attention :)";
