cscareerquestions;dfetdb;1570614819.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dfetdb/i_dont_like_working_in_cs_but_i_really_liked/;I don't like working in CS, but I really liked studying it and coding. What job would best suit me?;"I studied STEM for five years to get a Masters in Computer Science (scholarship), and I've been working now for two years as a Software Developer.In those two years of working, I've found out that I hate working in the area with a passion.Oh, I still love writing code and programming. But working in a company: there's something about taking something I love, a hobby, a passion, and seeing it corrupted by company people that just want to use it for money and only care about low-ball budgets and deadlines. Working in software development has ended up being completely different to what it was like studying it. The people are different. Instead of being around bright-eyed gee-whiz nerds, I'm surrounded by (snake oil) salesmen and managerial types that love to twist the words said by technical folk. I also consider my work unethical and I'm disgusted with myself for what I do. I found a job as a Full Stack Web Developer. Everything is REST APIs these days. And I'm working on web application systems that use REST APIs to on-sell your browsing interactions, so that everywhere you go you can be stalked by big data and machine learning-generated ads of what you just viewed.I hate my life now, and I can't understand how it turned out this way.Is it just that I'm in the wrong area? Maybe working for ""The Company"" or Web Development is not for me, although it's where all the jobs and big money are - at least it seems in Australia/NZ.What sort of CS job would recapture the feel of what it was like in university - coding for coding's sake, and being with like-minded tech nerds pushing each other to be the best?* Should I be aiming for specific companies for my next job? Are there companies with that sort of culture, like Microsoft, Adobe, Google? * Would academia jobs better suit me? But I found, doing postgrad, that it was also heavily bureaucratic (spending more time fighting for grants and gaming paper publications to ""publish or perish"") * Are there certain areas of work that would better suit me, e.g. instead of Web Development specializing in Computational Graphics?";"It sounds like you might want to try and find a more tech focused company, or perhaps a startup or a smaller business. They would have fewer issues like what you describe, at least in my experience.#My recent chats with people who've done academia have scared me away. It is all beurocracy, almost impossible now to get tenure, and just as much of a rat race, but with lower wages. I know of a (one degree of separation) professor who refuses to be a mentor for PhD students because he believes the career path for them is unethical. This is in Canada, which I don't imagine is too different from Aus/NZ.I do think this is a matter of culture fit. Has this been your only job out of school? Look for another one. Talk to your network for leads and try to talk to the devs who interview you about the things you're concerned about. I have had the pleasure of working with some pretty hardcore nerdy types, and it's been great! I've also watched bad management decisions crush our spirits and break the team apart as everyone hit their breaking point one after the other and left. This was at Amazon. Many of us are still at the company and have found shelter at various other teams who have better management. So it all depends on teams and managers. Don't be afraid to move around.#Similar experience working for non-tech company.Switched to a tech company. Much better. Also much higher pay.#Avoid startups which are intended to be sold/""exited"". Avoid corporate environments.I work at a consulting firm which is effectively a satellite research lab and it's probably where someone like you would thrive.Don't do webdev. Webdev is not about making interesting things unless you're an arthouse or something. It's about making *engaging* things that are good at getting money from people.Graphics programming sounds fun, explore what options there are!#Transition into a different specialty. I was in a similar place, surrounded by code monkeys and managers. I switched to computer vision, got a job, and I've enjoyed life ever since. You're the type of person who needs to be working on interesting problems, and you won't find hard problems doing web dev. Big data, machine learning, computer vision, etc all have interesting problems to solve.#Find a company that is using data to meet a mission you agree with. I worked for a large financial institution out of college that got by just through pushing numbers in the background that people didn't even think about. The work was pretty dull, I tried my hardest at it and worked to enjoy it, but had to admit that what was being done felt absolutely pointless outside of the context of the company. Find companies with interesting clients, or interesting purposes. Maybe they are looking to make life easier through automation, maybe they are looking to revolutionize integration and testing, maybe they are supporting a cause that means a lot to you. But don't work for generics, companies that are leveraging stacks to meet their internal process needs and that's, that work is soul sucking.#This is something I have struggled with and finally found a place with high-performing, like-minded people who just like tech.  Some aspects may never go away - at the end of the day when you work for a business they are trying to make money, and if it’s not a tech company it gets worse because they also don’t know and care about tech.  I had to finally accept there are parts of any org I may disagree with and focus on finding a great team to work with.When you look for your next job, interview them as much as they are you - ask to meet the team you will be working with, and set your standards for the type of people you want to work with.  It might take a few tries and no place is perfect but there are solid software teams out there, you just have to find them.  Best of luck!#[deleted]#Go for higher education. You'll always have the opportunity to work with Google, Microsoft etc as a research scientist provided that you maintain an excellent profile, then you'll get to research really interesting stuff and there will be much less intervention of bureaucracy/micromanagement. If you stay in academia, you'll still be able to interact with students and teach them Computer Science concepts which you seem to relish.#""""""The people are different. Instead of being around bright-eyed gee-whiz nerds, I'm surrounded by (snake oil) salesmen and managerial types that love to twist the words said by technical folk. """"""My experience and dissapointment exactly. With the exception of some bigger companies I imagine, Tech is the shystiest, most full of shit industry, now that business people have got their claws on it.Either go with it and try to wrangle some joy out of it, find a biz that isn't like this which is probably not easy, or switch to something less fucking Shysty.That being said the in my experience so far the tech industry is an absolute shit show for a tech person working in the industry.#Where there're people, there're bureaucracy/politics/profit motives. No one field or company is immune. That's the bubble bursting reality that all adults have to face.Passively, you can pick a group with pleasant people to work with. Most large company jobs are hit or miss depending on the immediate group, if the immediate supervisor/teammates are good, your workday will be at large pleasant, until any re-org, at which point you change job. Actively, you need to be part of the change you want to see. A good work environment is unfortunately not granted, and if everyone acts like let it be someone else's fight, I just don't see a good end to that strategy.#Have you held any full time jobs before this? Because what you're describing, other than the unethical part, is the crappy part of just having a job. No matter where you go there will always be managerial types. No matter your profession there will always be corporate wanting a deadline. It's all part and parcel to having a full time job. I'm not sure what you expected going into CS. There is a point though where you should cut the line. You need to double down at work and let things glance off you like oil and water. There is a line in the Sand. Figure out that line for yourself. I've seen many talented people end up not working in their field of study. I worked with a few back when I was a line cook with your exact story. Most of them were smart in school. They got great grades. When the real world hit them though they got afraid of doing the hard work they had to do to get where they want to be. So they ended up a line cook in their thirties because they made some stupid decisions.#So long as you're coding for a salary, you're not coding for coding's sake, and you'll never feel like you are. You felt that way in university because you didn't need to earn a wage to cover basic necessities like food or a roof. The fact that you need to earn money to cover those needs now inherently means you're going to have to make sacrifices from your ideal conditions, and employment is essentially a balance between the resources of the employer and the ambitions of the employee. Look for a better job (if tracking is morally objectional for you, you need to get out of webdev, potentially softeng too, and pivot towards low level hardware coding), but recognise that you're never going to find one that recaptures the feeling of being a student. You're not a student any more.#You can be an academic, since you have a master's already. Maybe find companies that are working on areas that interest you, ML or whatever else. Also, there's a lot more to CS than development work, even in a company. You can be an architect, manager, work your way up to CIO, there's lots of things you can do without writing code.#You don't need to switch industries to be happy.Sounds like you need to try your hand at a different company.  Don't go to a Microsoft or a Google, or you'll see the same problems.  Find a small company or startup.  If you need any minimum level of stability, look for a late-stage startup that has an established product and work that needs to be done.  You'll have less bureaucratic hoops to jump through, but will be able to do lots of meaningful work.  You'll still have the day to day boring tasks, but anticipating the cool stuff will get you through those.If you're ok taking risks, you might enjoy working at an early-stage startup for little to no salary but a ton of equity.  You'll get a ton of opportunities to work on cool and interesting things, but you'll also be under massive amounts of pressure.  The down side is that the boring work still does exist, and you'll be under pressure to do that and the exciting work in the same tight deadline.  Some people thrive in that environment though, and it's up to you to find out if you're one of them.Honestly after a few years of the startup thing I realized there was a lot I missed about the big company jobs.  You might hit the same thing.  Right now I'm at a late stage startup and still thinking it's the best mix of work/life balance with interesting, rewarding work.#If you have ideas, and I know this sound like a drag, start your own company. Doesn't have to make a huge amount of money but it will make it so you can do what you love in your own way without any bullshit or questionable ethical dilemmas. There are so many people like you who are sick and tired of corporate bullcrap and morally corrupt businesses. Start a good business like that and I guarantee that you will have a line of people wanting to work for you. You can even do it on the wide side while you work and grow it slowly until you dont need that original job anymore.#Dude, life is short, just follow your heart. Go crazy, try something you never thought you would work in in a million years. Go into finance, sales marketing, start a business, become a professional mma fighter for all it's worth. The world is your oyster m8.But u/vainstar23 you ask me, I already dedicated my life to the arcane arts of computer science! I simply must continue for it is my destiny!! Nonsense, if you are unhappy try something new. Don't fall for the gamblers dilemma where you feel compelled to continue investing in something that's going nowhere. Besides, you can always come back to it tomorrow. Nothing is lost at the end of it.On the contrary, taking a break and working on something different actually helps you grow as a person. It makes you more interesting and offers a new lense of how to look at the world. I started life as a bartender, I worked in fine dining, joined the army, became a mechanical engineering apprentice, an executive insurance broker and now I'm a software dev and remained one for the last 4 years. Do I feel like this is the end all? Hell no! And who knows? I could get into something else later. I'm adaptable you know? Just go for it dude and try something crazy. You can only thank yourself later on.#You might find it more fulfilling to work for companies/organizations building software for a good cause, like supporting non-profits or solving social problems. I'd look up the orgs and causes you care about and see what they've got going, software-wise, and figure out if you want to contribute to what they do in that way.You can help the orgs directly - some even pay their development/tech/IT staff - or you can join the companies that provide the software they use to make it better. Some of those companies will be just as scummy on the inside as the thing you're doing now, and then maybe it helps you decide to find which of their competitors could best use your skills to become a better solution to the problems you want to help solve.#After I worked for a couple of years, I felt 100% like you (except, what I worked on was ethically worse)... Forget about getting your satisfaction from your work, get it outside of work. Since you work in CS, CS as a hobby is dead. Find a better hobby. Meet some great people, cook, go to the ballet, fall in love and become an interesting person. Go to work so that you can live your life.#Find a start up that interests you. I felt exactly like you and didn't come back around to programming for years. I would have never imagined the enormous difference it makes to work for a company that isn't just trying to make money for the people at the top.#I feel the same way, but I like being broke even less.#Work is about making money.  I couldn't bear to code if I didn't know it was for some type of productivity.  You might have to figure out if you're skilled enough (which I assume you are) to make this a worthwhile job.  It's a comfortable to make comfortable money if you have the skills and aptitude.  IT is there to serve the company.  It's not for the sake of coding.  It's tough, but you might have to change your perspective.#Do you think something like going into Research would suit you more?#You might just want to join a consulting company, not one that is good at marketing online but try and look up the authors of your favorite tech books, see where they work. I empathize with that shock from working among bright-eyed passionate technologists vs business -people, (but I need them to keep sales up and my husband fed!)#I work for a really small business that is extremley ethical.My company wanted to stop peoples subscriptions for example if they thought they had paid too much. It was a serious discontent that the owners themselves brought up. Its the equivalent of netflix after 5 years of paying being like damn this is a good customer lets just give them this service for life now.#Try working for a non internet company? Like an engineering or automotive company.#I like the money it provides me. You're going to have to work anyway, you might never find a job you love, so you might as well get paid well for it.#The deadlines were probably tighter in college than in a work environment and you have to admit you are working for money as well. I would focus on doing the best job you can. If you don't like the environment, find another job.#My advice : find an organization you can work for that gives you purpose and your efforts go to good works. There is a lot of nonprofit organizations out there that need software engineers, web developers, dev ops, and more. Best of luck and I hope you find your spark again!#Well, school is a bit of a bubble and the real world is different.> Should I be aiming for specific companies for my next job? Are there  companies with that sort of culture, like Microsoft, Adobe, Google? NOOOO! Not Google. Always understand where a company's money comes from - this will be their priority. Microsoft has many paid business customers, but Google is an advertising company and not a technology one.>  And I'm working on web application systems that use REST APIs to  on-sell your browsing interactions, so that everywhere you go you can be  stalked by big data and machine learning-generated ads of what you just  viewed. So, like Google?I'm working on project management software. I help managers make decisions, visualize where time and resources get wasted... My job gives me pride and fulfillment. A friend of mine once worked on brain-computer interfaces to help paralyzed people use a computer. The job title? ""Full Stack Web Developer""Find a company to whose product you'd be proud to contribute.#If you happen to be in Sydney and are in it for the long term, work at Canva.#I had the exact same experience as you back in 2014. I'd worked a ton of software engineering internships and always had an excuse to myself about why I hated work. It took me 5 or 6 different work environments (including the Air Force Research Labs, Big engineering jobs and Startups) to come to the conclusion being a professional software engineer isn't for me. I just want to build cool stuff.Developer Evangelism ended up being the route for me. I get to make whatever I want as long as uses the tech of the company I work for and I can either write or get a talk out of whatever I'm doing. I still have to deal with the things that come along with working, but having the freedom to create whatever I feel like making is enough for me to enjoy my work.#To me, your job also does not sound exciting. Maybe that's a a factor, the exact role. It does not have a good impact, and it's just imho much more boring than really building, for example, a web application with front-end for users.I myself absolutely hate hate hate personalized advertising, so I deactivated all tracking and everything. I think if more people knew you could do it, almost everyone would do that. It's just creepy af, in my opinion. It scares the shit out of me when I see something I specifically searched for, in a whole different context/web service. It's really the worst. I don't understand why you have turned it on.#You'll find snake oil salesmen in every industry unfortunately.You may feel better with B2B products as at least then both you and the client are both doing the 'scamming'. You could also try software aimed at experts such as heavy industrial systems, you'll still find the scammy behaviour but it will be more along the lines of deadlines and pricing than entire feature sets.#Dude, you're in your first job out of school. Chill. You're in the wrong company. Find a different one.#Sounds a lot like a culture fit issue to me. I just left a Big N whose mission statement and general behavior I was totally behind, and the difference between that and previous roles was night and day. I respected the people I was working with, had confidence in *most* of my leadership all the way up through the CEO, and was proud of our products and services.I know not everyone has the luxury of picking and choosing where you work, so tailor this advice to your situation, but I do want to encourage people to at least give some thought into culture fit during interviewing. Before you go in to interview, look at the company, their behaviors, their mission statements, etc. Look around you when you're there, and pay attention to how the recruiters and other staff act--how people behave, how they treat each other and you. If there are things you're concerned about, *ask* your interviewers: they might have some perspective on it. If their answers don't satisfy you, either don't work there, or go in with a plan for getting out if you don't like it. As for you OP, already being there: I would encourage you to try looking for work in an organization that matches your values a little better before swearing off the field entirely. There really are good companies out there, in my opinion.#There are non-profits and companies working on climate change, micro loans, lifting cultures out of poverty.They pay less but they are there. And those non-profits will probably only have small IT teams full of devs that are willing to be paid less but have bigger responsibilities.So find those companies instead of feeling self-pity and self-contempt.#When I was in college, working for a SCUBA Shop, the owner gave me a piece of advice: Never turn something you love into your job. Because then it’s a job, and no one loves their job. All you succeed in doing is to remove one of the things you enjoy from your life.Welcome to the real world. If work was fun, companies wouldn’t pay you, you’d pay them#You go to work... to, uh, work.  Businesses are there to make money, not to cater to programmers wanting to change the world or build sleek systems.It's the same whether you are a carpenter, construction worker, firefighter, or teacher.As software developers we get above average pay for completing a 4 year degree (or no degree).  We get to sit in comfy, air-conditioned and heated offices, with good benefits, and our only real health concern is maintaining posture and exercising enough.  We have it super nice compared to most workers and people in society.  Software development is literally one of the highest paid fields to get in to with the lowest barriers of entry.  Posts like this just reek of entitlement.  I think you need to really adjust your expectations about life, because I don't think that simply changing your field is going to make you happy.Your university degree has literally less than nothing to do with real life.  It's merely a piece of paper to flash in front of employers in order to get a job.#> I've found out that I hate working ~~in the area~~ with a passion.Fixed that for you.> Working in software development has ended up being completely different to what it was like studying it.No shit?  You thought you'd be paid to pass tests?>  I'm surrounded by (snake oil) salesmen and managerial types that love to twist the words said by technical folk.You mean you are surrounded by salesmen and managerial types who love to translate incoherent technobabble bloviation into words that humans can understand?And they're getting paid more than you are even though you are several standard deviations smarter than they are and they could never have passed your algorithms class no matter how long they tried.  Makes you wonder whether we are using the wrong definition for ""smart"" here, doesn't it?> I also consider my work unethical and I'm disgusted with myself for what I do.If you try hard enough, you can convince yourself that every single job is unethical.  If all else fails, you can always remind the firefighter that saving that orphan from a burning church is unethical because that orphan will not pay his carbon tax and grow up to be responsible for burning oil and destroying the planet.> so that everywhere you go you can be stalked by big data and machine learning-generated ads>  Are there companies with that sort of culture, like Microsoft, Adobe, Google?Where do you think Google and Facebook make their money?  They do what you do, just better and at scale.> Would academia jobs better suit me?No.  You'll use your high powered intellect to dissect that industry too, and find reasons to hate it.> Are there certain areas of work that would better suit me, e.g. instead of Web Development specializing in Computational Graphics?No.  Work is work.  It's the same shit with different flies.TL DR - you're just complaining.  Suck it up, earn your living, and find something you enjoy to occupy the other 8 hours of your waking day so that you only have to be aware that you have a job half of the time.#Professional Grad Student!#Stripper.#What do you like working in?#I wonder if working at Leetcode might be like that#Marketting or Advertising for CS companies.#If you're up to it, academia will likely be a great fit for you.#It sounds like you might do better either in a governmental or security contractor position working with the DoD or NSA. Those tend to be more structured and they don't play fast and lose with the rules because it could mean life and death. A medical company would also be a safe bet where things are done the right way. It really just sounds like you don't like the industry you are in.#[deleted]#So I recently had a similar realization. I felt like programming for work is not as fun as it was in school. I found that in school, I was at least learning with each line I wrote. I felt more challenged. In the job, I use the same languages everyday and it’s gotten to the point where I am familiar with the code base so there isn’t much to learn anymore. As for what job would best suit you, think of what you like doing. Think of any jobs you’ve had and think of how you can take your enjoyment of programming and use it in that field. My husband and I are on a 6 month plan for us to quit our jobs and open a fast casual food place. I plan on using my development skills to build useful software for the business. But just an idea of what someone else is doing. So yeah, think of what you like doing, and maybe think of a way that development and programming can be used in that field. Best of luck.#Have you considered developer relations job?#Sounds like you should get a PhD and go into research to me. But, you might be better suited to research wings of larger companies than academic research at a university (not as much political craziness to navigate.) That being said, politics are just part of growing a career. There's going to be some you have to stomach. No area you move to will be perfect. But, you'll be a little better suited toward tolerating certain bits than others.  You will, however, need a PhD. Most companies won't hire researchers with less than that.   However, I do heavily suggest you try to find a better environment first. I've been on some very good teams and some pretty dysfunctional ones. I will tell you that, doing the essentially same thing, it is a HUGE shift in ability to tolerate the situation. If you find a company that's focused on immediate profit growth, you will almost invariably be in a position like you are now. You need to find a company who's more focused on a long-term mission/strategy/goal. Those companies tend to value their people more often because they're not focused on ringing the dollars and cents out of every action, but more focused on trying to achieve their larger goal and recognize the people working with them are the vehicle to do that. Culture MATTERS. A lot. Probably as much as the monetary compensation.#Instead of research, why don't you get into teaching at a community/technical college or at a high school?#There are a lot of companies and government organizations hiring that aren't in the business of tracking people.  Just about any research branch of a university that has grant funding hires IT staff to do analysis, every company and government organization needs administrators whether they be cloud based or not, and there are tons of products out there that you'd be hard pressed to find the unethical part of their service.  Start looking for other jobs and when you do, check out their mission statement and what their product offering is.  Don't apply for one that doesn't align with your values.#It's not a job I would recommend, but it's not uncommon for those enamored by the education system to pursue teaching. Have you considered being a professor?#I met a dude on IRC who tries to hire programmers to work for open source companies with potentially useful social value (say energy savings). Would you like that ?#I can understand working with shady people, but there is nothing wrong with selling software for a profit. The software only exists because of a market need, not the other way around. Sounds like you need to find a research position since you aren't fond of the business side of things. Or if you are ambitious start your own tech company that meets your vision.#Not really on your level but I'm a data analyst and I code daily. What I love about it is building my OWN tools usually from scratch. The tools and projects are usually pretty small. I love it because I get to do my own thing. I don't have to work with a lot of other people's code and when I do, I just redevelop the tool to fit my style because the tools are small, it doesn't take much time#I think you're being more than a little disingenuous when you say things like ""... managerial types that love to twist the words said by technical folk..."" Perhaps you are just really bad at communicating.#Look into working for a non-profit perhaps?#You wanna prioritize perfect design, contribute to Open Source. In business, time is money#You could check out the organizations on [Tech Jobs for Good](https://www.techjobsforgood.com) to see if any of those roles/organizations get you excited. That being said, there are plenty of organizations that have a more tech-focused product and knowing what you want out of a company culture & values will help you find places that are more enjoyable to work for.#There are a lot of other companies in a lot of other industries that need programmers.  For example, a lot of life science companies need programmers to help manage and model their data so that they can better test diseases and save people’s lives.I don’t think you hate your profession, I think you hate your current job.  And that’s a much easier problem to solve.#I ended up at a late stage startup and love it.  There's business pressures for sure, but the culture is engineering friendly.  I had a shitty experience at my last place for reasons similar to what you describe.  I may have gotten  lucky in this current place, but I can't imagine that there aren't other good companies out there.#My question would be, have you been working for the same company the entire time you have been out of school? Maybe try going to meetups in your local area to understand the culture and drive of other employers. I can completely relate to that passion turning into a ""sell-out"" mentality. I have been there. My advice is to seek community locally and have open discussion with other devs. If you feel like shit about your job, maybe do some non-profit work for the sake of your soul?#If you're willing to work for $32,000 a year, many public libraries need a ""tech guy"" on staff.#Perhaps get into a research position, security research can be lucrative.#It sounds like you work for a company whose mission you don’t agree with. I’d suggest finding a new job. I work at a social impact startup, and I love my job because I feel like I’m doing something worthwhile every day. I’m just as skeptical of big tech as you are — there *are* tech jobs out there that aren’t bullshit.#A counter argument:You cannot escape deadlines and working with business folk and the reality of having to make 💰. At a job, there is no such thing as just coding for coding's sake.None of that is necessarily bad. Deadlines (ideally) come from setting goals and having alignment on what you're building. Working with business folk can be really great and teach you a lot of things that just talking with other engineers won't get you. Having to make money means coding something that people actually find value in, versus school projects no one cares about.You have to learn a lot of other skills besides just coding to make the most of the coding you do. But yes it can still be really rewarding.Now if you don't agree with your company's ethics and if they're selling snake oil, absolutely quit and find somewhere else. But in general I think you can find a good experience somewhere if you're a bit more open to the non-purely-coding aspects of the job.#Maybe research?#Get a new job manI'd hate that too#Welcome to the world of work. My only advice would be to try to save as much of your salary as you can and become financially independent. Then you can do whatever you want, start here: [https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/)#A year ago I decided (together with a colleague) to build a startup. I worked almost 20 years for big companies. I really liked it (otherwise I would not have done it 20 years), but some of my wishes / capacity /drivers I could not really live/address in the way I would like. E.g. am extremely good in creating products, but I also wont to bring them to life (not as programmer, but creating / shaping and leading this process). In a big organization you either be a product manager or project manager. A year ago I realized that for me it is really important to have this combination and also being able to share my knowledge. This is how StartupSpider ([www.startupspider.com](https://www.startupspider.com)) was born (soon we opening the platform for registration, maybe you can use it to find others like you or a Startup that fits). However, a Startup is not really easy (not in the role as a founder and also not as employee). You have huge time pressure, money challenges and you are your own ""help-desk"". Also it is like a marriage, because you are much closer to each other as in a normal company. Therefore selecting the right Startup / team is important. E.g. I am extremely thankful we all knew each other from before E.g. I have clearly some strengths, but definitively also my negative sides... therefore it is important to know each other and that it fits. Otherwise you will be even less happy as you are today....I wish you all the best for your future and I hope you find what you are looking for...#I'm not gonna lie, the title confuses the hell out of me. You don't like ""working in CS"" but you work as a software developer and like coding? What do you mean by ""working in CS""? You mean you don't like working as a programmer?#Hop around to different companies  they certainly aren't all the same.  Parts of Facebook and parts of Google certainly have the culture you'd like.   That said, I suspect finding a way to get into infrastructure jobs - instead of front-end - may be a win as well.  Infra doesn't really deal with product managers, or sales, and the goal is quality, not primarily speed-out-the-door.#PHD student and then professorOr suck it up and realize that most people don’t love their jobs, and significant portion hate them. Hobbies lose a lot of fun when you do them for work. Same thing happens to musicians and artists too.Get a hobby and look for a more interesting job, but be aware it won’t be like it is in college. Tech companies will be better a place to look.#It's not that you dont like working in cs, you don't like working at all. Grow up and stop being lazy#[deleted]#Worked before in a start up, and moved to a big company that does tech consulting for another start up: I would have to disagree. Start up could means you are taking less focused roles, and you have to do a bit of everything, which is the opposite of what you think. They usually don’t have a reputation to hire enough talents and they also need to get things quickly done by fewer people to prove they are worthy for next round funding.#This! Please, don't give up hope. Try changing industry or company. I just changed from a travel company to an actual software company. I feel like I'm surrounded by nerds and I love it!#>I know of a (one degree of separation) professor who refuses to be a mentor for PhD students because he believes the career path for them is unethical. That person doesn't sound like they want to be a professor or a researcher anymore, which is fine. That said, academia isn't all bad. I'm a ""soft money"" security researcher at a university and it's a pretty good life. The community is amazing, funding isn't hard to come by if you know what you're doing, and I find it really rewarding to mentor students (and they really appreciate it too, whether they go on to industry or academia themselves). I also do hourly consulting and am involved in a startup, so there's a ton of options should funding dry up.Maybe it's bad if you're in a focus area that isn't as readily applicable and in-demand as security, but to say that all CS academia sucks is painting it in too broad a stroke.#Nice guy, doesn’t want to pummel them into the ground as a PhD prof. There are folks in undergrad that get that pummeling either way. How I survived was reading how grad students survived... now I just do my own thing while being part of the team in an IC style consult. Either way good advice all around. Team fit and culture is important. Mine still has some of the bs but I’m also pushy too when I just do it... easier said than done however.#[deleted]#How'd you get into computer vision?#> It may be something to try outThe challenge for OP is that it is something of a one-way journey.Yes, you can come back from devops => SWE, but it is a hard slog, from an interview POV.#If he’s bothered by big data maybe those places aren’t the best#The big companies are absolutely not better.#[deleted]#Thanks for this. I'm pretty certain I don't want to work in an office forever, but the only other things I can think of doing with myself don't really earn a livable wage.#Sleep a third of your life, work a third for a job you hate that pays the bills, be exhausted and do chores the remaining third. This is why the population is depressed. Because this is considered good advice. Company greed has become ridiculous. It’s one thing to be profitable. It’s another to sacrifice everything for shareholder and ceo greed. Capitalism is failing us.We are more productive than we’ve ever been, but wages have stagnated and everything is for the bottom line. Jobs have become specialized to the point that there’s no joy or creativity allowed.We should be fighting for shorter workweeks. Other countries have succeeded. We should be voting for politicians who will overturn Citizens United, which is what made corporate lobbying legal, has given corporations so much power and created an oligarchy instead of a democracy, we should work together to unionize and use our numbers to gain more freedom and control over the large portion of our lives spent at work, we should have more control of the profits of our labor instead of having them stolen by shareholders who literally do nothing or CEOs who unjustly make hundreds and thousands times more than us. It’s like indentured servitude. We have power in numbers and we should fight back for better lives.#Put up with work and look forward to the second that shift is over. I get what you mean but that seems like a very dismal way to live. Instead work hard to find work that you enjoy showing up to. It ain’t easy but those types of jobs are out there.#I work for a manufacturing company. Generally, low hours, no micromanagement, I get to pick tech stack and architecture. When I'm burned out I  take it easy or leave a bit early.Honestly, I had an offer from a fortune 1k company but in the end didnt take it because of long days, daily stand ups and open office design. Plus the team lead liked me, I solved all the brain teaser with ease. When I told him I wanted to switch to bigger corp/team he said the grass is always greener on the other side.....and when he said that he looked miserable.#People do not have the correct perspective. You work for a company. The company is their to maintain a profit. You do what they need. The people using our websites do not care about code  they just want it to do what they want.#Sales and consultancy is even more cut throat about making money.  Sure, they'll talk a good game about wanting to hire ""curious minds"" that want to work on ""interesting code and systems.""  But in the end, the consulting firm has a contract to build something for the client - and OP would have even more pressure and less negotiating room in that environment.  It literally takes everything that they are describing they don't like, and amps it up.#I've been building [Tech Jobs for Good](https://www.techjobsforgood.com) to make it easier to find organizations where your technical skills can be used for a inspiring purpose.#Where was your friend doing work on brain-computer interfaces working? Sounds like a great mission.#Whats the good thing about Canva? I've seen it mentioned a bit here in reddit#I'm working on building [Tech Jobs for Good](https://www.techjobsforgood.com) to make it easier to find organizations where you can have an impact - let me know if there are any organizations I should know about.While some nonprofits won't pay much, there are plenty of organizations that offer pretty competitive salaries.#Found the snake oil salesman and his name is Chad.#Don't get the down votes.  This is 100% spot on.You go to work - to work.  Don't like it?  You are free to leave.  No one is forcing you to be there.#I hate babies and firefighters now#Can I ask what a REST API website is? Like a website/service that is primarily just an API, like Stripe?#> but there is nothing wrong with selling software for a profit.Eh I think some of the biggest issues a consumer faces in software ( things like micro transactions in games or privacy concerns in almost all closed sourced software, or even the dreaded turning everything into a subscription service) is due to companies only caring about the profit of software.FOSS is the way, and profit can exist in that model, but it cant be the focus.#[deleted]#> PHD student and then a 10% chance of becoming a professoris more like it.#And find a job that better matches your personal values.  Easier said than done.#> but if OP wants to work somewhere where there is respect for design/development,Prioritizing shipping quickly does _not_ necessarily mean there's no respect for design or development. It means design and development are aiming at different things than they would be in a more enterprisey environment.As a dev at a startup you accept that you are trading off maintainability for velocity now. At a bigco you are trading off velocity now for maintainability/resiliency/etc. Totally different types of development, and often bigco people totally suck at startup jobs and vice-versa. Nothing to do with ""no respect for development"", just ""we can't spend weeks making sure this CRUD endpoint is idempotent and resilient at 1million req/s"" because that kind of development has no value to a startup.#Sounds like my workplace. CEO just wants the company bought#> The startup has more of an incentive to push out an MVP as quickly as possible.I agree that this is true of a lot of startups... but not all. Find a startup where the goal isn't a quick exit, but a sustainable product. I agree that they're less common, but they do exist.#[deleted]#Yep this 100%#Yeah, to be fair, just like industry it all depends on the institution and the people you work with.#> funding isn't hard to come by if you know what you're doing... and you're in the right field#Nominally, it's a consulting firm who does data monitoring/analysis tools, expanding recently into more advanced machine learning which is one of the reasons I was brought on.Effectively, we only have one client so we are doing 100% of our work on their systems which means we are acting like a research lab for this company, receiving problem definitions and proposing solutions / moving forward if it sounds reasonable.It's a nice position, especially for the CEO. Deadlines are pretty much entirely self-defined so there's not a whole lot of pressure from above. We just have to keep the client satisfied that they'll get the results soonish. The client isn't even really interested in technical details until projects pass the feasibility study stage so you can dazzle 'em with fun plots and keep poking at the algorithm you're composing. It's a nice balance but honestly I work better when there's a clear sequence of small deadlines and I have to do that for myself since I'm lead on this particular project, which I haven't had to do before. So I've been forced to confront my own slacking-off behavior and start thinking about it on project management terms which has its own benefits.This small startup-ish environment means we also have to do most of our own sysadmin stuff though we have an IT guy who comes in in the evenings if we need something done.#Went back for a masters degree and did a masters thesis on computer vision#There are still plenty of avenues that he can explore. If he's interested in math and algorithms, he could work on theoretical CS. If he's interested in computer architecture, operating system etc, he could work on systems science. In general, I think that there are more nerdy people in academia compared to industry and there are greater opportunities of working on interesting stuff.#Yeap, I am working in one of them I have never seen such crazy before.#What did you go into?#What did you go into? What was the application process like given your different background?#Also wondering what you went into.  I'm in literally the same boat as OP#If it wasn't for the money, what would you want to do?#Sir this is a Wendy's#In *Bullshit Jobs* by David Graeber, he calls our current situation ""managerial feudalism"" and comes up with a bunch of terms for the more pointless things that happen in workplaces. The way we think of work is kind of like the gorilla in a room. So much useless BS happens, yet we carry on like good worker ants. It would be nice if more politicians would push for shorter workweeks and, possibly, more actually meaningful work.#I should not be too tired after working.... I sit all day drinking coffee and pressing buttons. It is not exactly back breaking labor.I agree with you on the failure of modern day capitalism, but I also see that the situation is not going to change for me anytime soon. Fight it, sure, but you also have to adapt to the current reality the best you can. Make sure you have meaning and purpose in your life, and you really need to get those from outside of your job.#[deleted]#Wow when I did consulting it was basically my client struggling to deliver and I provide my insights which then creates a much healthier delivery environment. So yea consulting is a broad term, so yea find where the intellectuals get hired, they usually have a little oasis in a bigger company where their knowledge is valued#That's awesome! I'll definitely check it out. It's always nice to have a job that makes you excited about what you're doing.#Do you know anything similar for Europe?#Options hold good potential upsidePretty much everyone who doesn't want to go to USA, or found Google Sydney boring works there#[deleted]#I find it much less problematic in my line of work where I develop business applications, as in cost of doing.#Yeah but you are talking about a shitty product that the market should correct for. I'm just making the point that selling a product for a profit, even if it's not the best quality, is not unethical, which OP seemed to disagree with.#I work for Facebook, and may disagree with your premise there.I work with and for good people who have a lot of empathy.We've got problems to fix, but I see people actively working to fix the problems.It's literally the best place I've worked in twenty years in industry, across a slew of different types of employer.So yes, really  I'd advise most folks to take a look, if you have that as an option.  If you feel strongly that the company is doing something horrid, join us and work to change it  we need people with those strong opinions, and it's still a small-enough-feeling company that individuals actually do have the power to nudge it in various directions.#10%? More like 87% chance of developing some sort of mental problem like depression or a burnout, and then around a 1% chance of making professor (probably less).#I’ve worked at a startup that took engineering seriously, it was a very fun job until a new CEO came in and killed the atmosphere.I work at another startup now that has the attitude of “ship it fast and dirty”, and I sympathise with the op. It’s depressing because I have no pride in my work, stressful, and I feel like my skills are in atrophy. I have one month left there and I can’t wait to go.I’ve worked at 7 different places now and I know that things can be good or bad, all dependent on how seriously management takes engineering.#[deleted]#That's really a strawman though.  You're assuming the startup is incompetently managing the scope of work.  If you're managing a software team you have to make the choice to do things the right way.  Part of that is product design and properly scoping the work.  What is the minimum you need to give somebody a useful thing.  What features are your customers excited about?  What components do you need to have a complete system as early as possible?    During that you don't have to actually build the thing.  You're not getting 1 million req/s for an application nobody has ever used.  You just need it to be designed in a way that when you have the time to spend on it you wouldn't have to tear the whole codebase apart.   Its actually nice to do it that way, because you tend to write useful abstractions early on but not have to dig into the nitty gritty of every little implementation detail until its a priority.  You can write maintainable, secure, testable code from day 1.  It will help your velocity to do things correct, actually, because your shit will actually work.#[deleted]#[deleted]#Yup, that's implied in speaking about my experience.#I actually started in Physics department at my first MSc. Process is usually the same from paperwork perspective. I can advise contacting the professor you have interest in working with and asking him if he is looking for students, if he has funding etc. In terms of coursework, usually catching up is left to you via coursework or as additional study, so don't expect much help from professors. It can become brutal. It was for me, and my PI lost funding and didn't inform me about it so I quit. Don't get too invested in anything really.Also, never pay for grad school, unless MBA.#I'm sure I would be happy with plenty of things.One idea I have is to live in a rural area with a workshop where I could make everything from small metal sculptures to earrings and other jewelry. I'd probably want to sell my stuff online and at flea markets if I were to do this. I'd really want to get back into drawing and photography as well - I used to enjoy both of those things before I resigned myself to feeling tired and stressed out all the time.I could even see myself still making websites for people in that situation - I would just take on no-rush jobs and work at my leisure rather than worrying about deadlines and having enough clients to feed myself.Honestly, anything where I can create things and not follow a set schedule would probably be great for me. I once worked out a 3 month consulting gig after leaving a company where I was able to make rent and save a bit working ~15 hours a week and it was absolutely amazing.#Aight, but I'm not a sir.#[Real Changers](https://www.realchangers.com/) is similar, I'm not sure if there are other sites like that based in Europe#Ahhh gotcha, makes sense, ty.#[deleted]#You're on to something.I don't know of any mechanism to turn bright optimistic people into depressed self doubters than a PhD program, except for the fortunate few who are really born for research and get lucky about finding appropriate work after they finish.#But he said it with a higher word count. Checkmate, atheist#When interviewing, ask who's funding them, if they have an exit strategy, what the long term plans for the company are. Most startups that are built to flip don't seem to be very ashamed about it.#I mean, I lead teams to make some direct improvements to News Feed to fix some of the issues you might have had legit complaints with.  I get to directly improve the thing, which feels like a good spend of my time.Aside from that, my last major job was to move all of Google to HTTPS  I feel like I have a leg to stand on.#[deleted]#I can't comment on individual issues, but I'd respectfully disagree, as I have details you perhaps don't.If you'd like to pick one of those, go for it, but responding to a wall of links isn't a really productive goal for either of us.#[deleted]#If you're ranting at me, there's not a lot I can do here. It may be safe to assume I know a few things you don't on this front, and I really don't want to dive into details of a co-workers death, other than to say that internal official and unofficial response has been solid.#[deleted]#Not quite sure what to say to someone who states I'm delusional. I can't speak entirely freely about everything I know, much as anyone who works for any company can't exactly go into details on a public forum. That's held true everywhere I've worked, so this feels pretty reasonable. I'm still not clear what your goal is, but good luck, regardless."

I have another 500,000 split into some other vet alts but its lower now as they have burned me also so I just wanna know if you guys think 500,000 is a decent stake in VeChain#Damn it wanted to accumulate 1mil vet for around 3500 bucks within a few months. Now it already increased to above 3800 $ (with fees for transfering the btc or eth to the exchange that got VET).&#x200B Feelsbadman, tough I'm happy for all you holders for the green numbers recently =)#Waking up and vet isn’t red , strange feeling :)Also volume on binance around 3 million , it was like 0,6 million a few days ago#How censored do you think we are here in regards to showing support for HongKong?If Vechain showed support for HK would every Chinese partnership pull out? Would we lose all ground and progress we made in China? What if someone created a Dapp or something that in some way supported the protests. Could something like this affect my investment and the success of Vechain?Food for thought.#What's the catch with Oceanex turbo?#Anyone has additional info about twitter account TheresaFinn @bleedtoforget ?Here her/his post 3 h ago:got some interesting news from inside the foundation.cant share them public.dont sell your $vet, better buy more as long as its in this price range. that will change. #news where very huge. it started already.#vechain #btc #bitcoin #ethereum #xrp #ripple #eth #XLM #stellar#Hmmm, dont wanna be the pessimist. If u go to daily or weekly VET/USD chart this weakish upswing kinda looks like another preparation for a strong downfall. BTC the cause offcourse. What you guys think?#While this is true. If BTC 100x you're around 900k per BTC. If VET 100x you're at .34 My thinking is VET will go much higher than .34 eventually. So I'm sending this to reassure you (and me)  )#Same boat my friend. Today I decide to go for Thunder node at 45 sats, should've bought BTC instead#One more bull trap while btc runs, before true vetbtc reversal (dec-Jan-feb)#I don't think we'll drop far from 46 anymore with the buyback going on. Unless btc goes parabolic#This is very important imo#Thats not only a good sign for US based traders but also for Vechain regarding US regulations.   Bittrex is very selective which coins they list and have delisted tonnes of coins.#Bittrex was the first ever exchange I traded on when I first got into crypto in 2017 (after using Kraken as my fiat on ramp). For me, this is full circle.#Unpopular opinion: it means that Bittrex thinks that VET could be considered a security in the United States under the Howey test. Hopefully Congress or the courts will eventually give some clarity on what makes a token a security.#I can bitch with you. Lost around the same amount. Let's turn this shit around together. Stay strong.#I’d like to know who’s down how much. Go on people, let it rip.. I’m down ~$50k#I bought an X node at around the time they were released (there was a march 20th 2018 cut off, or you could never get one again (ho-ho) so it was a once in a lifetime chance and I took it) I dont know exactly what the vet(ven) price was on the day I bought in early march 2018, but as the weeks and months pass I am beginning to think I may be down on the deal myself. Still positive tho and my new plan was to hold until 2077 when I hope to retire and use my state pension to dca before I get the lambo.#Down more, wont bitch.#Well done. Now you can carry over 3k for 18 years?#Words going around that Ethereum was not much more than an experiment. It wasn’t really designed to scale.#Touché.#Any theories floating around about where these transactions are coming from?#[deleted]#And last week it was literally the apocalypse... Like reading bones#High standards in terms of compliance and security. Great track record. Used to be one of the main exchanges before the rise of binance.#Bittrex is top tier.#Fiat on ramps for btc#I think it was (the) one of the most used exchanges for alts before binance took the spotlight. I used to trade on it. Nothing bad to say about em...#Ocean ex#Is anything happening with the tic token now? Edit* I cant open links#Why is OceanEx not pulling BAG and TIC ?#Bit concerning though, that Vechain does seemingly very little due diligence before allowing these companies using Vechain as a platform. I understand vechain wants to become a ecosystem beyond VET/VTHO but these scams create a very very bad look.#Apparently so:https://twitter.com/BittrexIntl/status/1181979927337418752?s=20#Yes#This should bring us closer to Doge again on cmc ranking!  )#Just did so.

Bittrex has fiat on ramps for bitcoin , everyone can buy vet on bittrex by buying btc with dollar and switch to vet#Let's keep this positivity flowing!#I think this project is actually pretty cool. So much shoe business in China and this is a great way to deal with the counterfeit problem. Real application and I like how their marketing looks so far.#Where did you hear of that allegation?#i saw this question allready more than a few times and weird enough all my withdrawls ( i guess +- 10) were allmost instantly...#Yeah I waited a few hours for a tx last week#[deleted]#Getting an x node way back was the equivalent of 600,000.It was also an investment of approx $25,000So if those guys ever want to see a return on that investment, then 500k right now being worth about $1800 should see a very good return aswell.#[removed]#Imagine VECHAIN at $100 someday.

Lol#Vechain should not get involved politically at all or they will risk EVERYTHING. STICK TO THE BUSINESS#With recent news on organizational position taking by companies (NBA, Redbull, etc) on the current situation in Hong Kong, I wouldn't be surprised if any company in the US that Vechain is partnered with decides to keep their head down for a while, so basically if that's the case, we may not hear about US partnerships until HK is far out of the headlines.#Promotional stunt. Seems an attempt to boost the volume on the small projects while at the same time increasing the value of OCE.#No catch, in this way OCE gets burned while a project like XMAX (saw the presentation during the meetup and was actually quite impressed) sells coins below market price.In the end it's basically a form of marketing. Pay money (or sell your coins for low value) and get social media attention in return. But in this way, but XMAX and OCE holders benefit.  Quite a smart strategy actually :)#If I had one VET for every tweet like this I’ve seen, I’d be a mjolnir massive whale#she sure is trying to get some attention...or some of the V members had a great night (or hours) with her and therefore the insider info 😂#Well last quarter foundation purchased 1B of Vet with average price of 0.005 of coz i’m not selling at 0.0038#She later tweeted about #coinbase #binance. Maybe we will be listed in the us? Who knows.. I‘ve also seen Logino from SafeHaven tweeting that their team helped to achieve the listing on Bittrex Int. Their legal team should be very knowledgeable. Maybe they sorted some legal stuff out about Vet not beeing a security or smt else..#I checked her other tweets, which are in german. A lot of far-right / lunatic bs. This is not legit at all!#True. VET needs a strong kick in the nuts for the picture to change completely. One giant company onbording with consistent transactions that grow week over week and daily VTHO burn exceeding the gen will be the kick.#Personally I don't like the vet/usd comparison because it's true nature is obfuscated by btc.  Until there are fiat onramps direct into vet I wouldn't trust it at all.  When vet was ven it was even harder to track because of the whole eth/btc relationship.  vet/btc on Oceanex was looking sweet yesterday - everything was in place for a trend reversal... but vet isn't going to reverse trend until vtho does.  We need more transactions and a bullish vtho/usdt chart before vet does anything noteworthy.tldr: Watch vtho instead#thx. but no need to, im bullish af my friend  )#wel congratz anyway, it is a huge milestone though..#could be. lets hope. but about btc : if btc closes above 8.75k its on the road to 14k again and bull market is official. i can only hope we don't start bleeding then. - again.#It's Bittrex International for the listing which is not open to US traders#Yup now others will follow :)#Same story here (but with Coinbase as my fiat on ramp).#Why would it mean Bittrex thinks that?#down 80k. sold a few apartments for a huge gain and still didn't pay taxes because of crytpo....thanks?edit: that doesn't include 135k in hardware to mine (ETH/BTC) that is sitting in my garage not connected to anything. Totally unrelated, anyone want to buy  any GPUs or S9s?#I’m down. Not as much as you but definitely in the tens of thousands of dollars. Will need to do the sums to tot it all up. Are people still confident this VET will turn a corner? I’m holding and will continue to do so for as long as it takes. Nothing to lose now right?!But I’ll admit my confidence in getting my money back is starting to wane.#30k checking in.#Down from ATH or from initial investment?#You are going to retire in 2077? Are you literally 7 years old right now? If so, super impressive little man.#OG X node holder as well. I’ll tell you the price at that time in a few minutes.

Those VEN cost me $3.88 each, or $0.0388 VET equivalent price. At that point I had just reached the minimum X Node requirement. Since then, I have upgraded to thunder X, and I added enough VET to qualify for Mjolnir X but have not made that upgrade. Wen $0.012 again?#Down more than that on my portfolio, that number is just realized loss from 2018. My entire portfolio is down about 66-70% right now and the number is much larger than 55k. Oh well#Down more, will bitch and moan and TAKE IT UP THE TAILPIPE.#It is going to offset my other gains for the year, and i will likely still have enough loss to claim 3k this year, probably not for 18 years though.#Look in the previous couple dailies. I believe there was some theories posted in there.#I think most including myself lean towards the newly launch Carbon Credit App in China however I have no way to prove this.#Until our government makes any sort of ruling on anything and actually define the space, I’m not really worried about it to be honest.  Most of my investment is obviously on the original purchase of VET and BTC and have never sold so I expect by the time bull market comes and I do want to sell some there will be more clarity.  If they audit me and want to come back for taxes on my hundreds of dollars of VTHO over the last year or so, so be it- that will be chump change at that point#You will have to report it as income.  Calculate an average amount and price every month or so.  Similar to the need to report any interest a bank pays you.#Surely there is a Dapp for that?#They're not a bad exchange but they still don't pay out GAS for NEO holders there which makes it likely that it will be the same for VET and VTHO.#He writes that the offices are shuttered and employees were paid with used office equipment.#Public blockchain open for anyone to build on.

You need to work to put yourself in the position to take care of opportunities when they come up.If you're doing this right now then that's great, there's too many people that look at what I have now and say ""I wish I had that"". I didn't trip and fall on it, I've kept my head down driving a crap car, living in the cheapest places, hoarding all my money to start out.

Although I DO hope it happens slower than a months time this time around so I can get some sweet, sweet VTHO.#I think we’re saying the same thing: Bittrex thinks there is a non-zero percent chance that VET could be considered a security under the Howey test.#There is no source because it doesn’t fail the howey test which is by the way an outdated tool to measure a crypto People who followed the recent action by the sec should know that there is nothing to worry . Maybe vechain gets a fine for their activity before main net ( same as eos ) and that’s it Vet utility has existed since day one ( main net ). Many entities use vechain (dnvgl, byd, totient labs , plair etc ) and the network is maintained by a large group of companies . It has many use cases etc . Vet will never be a security#I’ve lost track of how many times I’ve said “it’ll never go below xxx sats or x usd” lol#Serious question but how many friends of the same level would you say did not go in at all?Of your pool (that you mentioned) no ones going to be buying your crypto (if it goes up) so who is?

You’re essentially saying the same thing but people are upvoting one and not the other.#Sorry took a while to get back to a computer.I'm not sure what you're saying here. I started buying VET around 3 dollars (.03 current prices) so of COURSE right now it sounds ridiculous. Once the market turns around and each VET is worth .03 there will be a ton of people that will buy, because that will be the cost per VET.When you say ""no one is going to buy your crypto"" you're talking volume. There's plenty of volume, and when the price is higher there will be even more volume. If volume goes to 0 and nobody is buying or selling yes, that would be a problem. I don't think that's very likely.#Did it really start ok?

I know many wine producers and i can tell u nobody is interested in the supplychain atm. Many reasons behind it.One of the reasons is: Atm we have a small export to China due to our strong connection with USA since II WW (see trade war Trump-Xi) and because in Europe we are considered the brother Fredo of France and Germany (i guess everybody here knows the movie Godfather yes?).But...But i know that our Prime Minister - Giuseppe Conte - is well connected with DNV GL - currently all major italian companies in which government have shares are working directly with DNV GL, including ENEL and ENI - two of the biggest. Last year ENEL decided to leave nuclear, coal and gas market behind (i know because i had to go to work somewhere else since i have nuclear background) in order to focus 100% in renewable energy with the new branch ENEL GREEN POWER).Guys, ENEL its not only in Italy, they control energy sector also Spain, Romania and the whole south America - Chile, Argentina, Perù, Brasile, etc with an annual gross income of circa 70 billions - Btw, Chile govt is already working with BYD and ENEL X- See this::[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-08-09/santiago-s-electric-bus-fleet-cuts-costs-and-cleans-the-air](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-08-09/santiago-s-electric-bus-fleet-cuts-costs-and-cleans-the-air)Let me close this post saying this:I heard from my friends in Rome that something possibly related to Vechain,DNV GL and ENEL will be included in the badget law (in italian is called DEF - Documento di Economia e Finanza) for year 2020.Italian wine producers are waiting for the final call of government to act accordingly.It will probably take a while (knowing the long iter of italian parliament - 2 chambers - 20 commissions + the President of the Republic, Costitutional court and Corte dei Conti - judges which are asked to evaluate if numbers are sustainable - to approve the document).Can u imagine guys? We have to pay wages for all these lices in Rome :(The so called DEF will be officially released in november or december. Lets wait and see what will be included in it.And Also San Marino obviously is involved - Its the test for us to understand if the system could work in a more complex country, like Italy is.First --> **San Marino** \--> **37.000 citizens** \--> Then --> **Italy** \--> **60.000.000 citizens**As Sunny said, everything is connected...So, do not give up boys.Here in Italy we say: **Il tempo è galantuomo** \- Or **Things work out over time**I will continue to read u guys and when DEF will be out i will try to summarize it for u if i see something interesting.#While finalizing my taxes has gotten me a little down from actually seeing how much value I lost in 2018 alone, the universe sent a pick me up. Guess who was just promoted to Senior Developer!? this guy! Now VET stay low until I get my lump sum 2 month backdated raise funds! :)You stay classy #VEFam#Some nice discussions going on in here today. So damn good to see positive, constructive conversations taking place instead of... you now what. I shudder to say those words out of fear of sparking another debate. Anywayyy.. nice job guys n gals! On another note, RE: Italian wine/DNVGL@RGrotolla mentioned that their business of ‘trust’ of a 155 years was threatened by Blockchain. IMO, They saw Blockchain as an existential threat, AND their savior. In other words, they had a choice to make, which was either fight this new wave or embrace it. A decision needed to be made, and they chose to embrace it with open arms.They found and bought stake in a company that suits their needs, has the tech to compete, and has the vision that complements their views on business. Make no mistake, DNVGL is ALL IN on Vechain and Blockchain. They will push to have this tech adopted with all of their might. And that means lobbying lawmakers, enterprises, large accounting firms. They have built a network of hundreds of years that spans all of these spectrums. They know the right people. They know how to schmooze, convince, push, and make deals with people at the highest levels. These guys are no joke. Really interested to see how it all pans out, and excited for the future.#Hello guys,after my yesterday post about the italian parliament discussing the DEF 2020 (badget law), this morning one friend of mine sent me the draft issued by Consiglio dei Ministri (govt). To be clear about all steps:CDM (Consiglio dei Ministri) is the govt table where this draft has been issued, discussed and approved.Italian parliament will discuss it again in the next 2 months before the final approval, as yesterday said, in december.I want to clarify also that this draft could be slightly modified in  parliament during the final discussion but the core of the document wont change that much.Document is about 650 pages, i start now my research, in a couple of hours i will post my thoughts.#Hey guys, I'm gonna show you one more wallet.

I put this image together from some things I stumbled upon last week. (*A news article, a list of partners in the association listed below, and the VeChain slide from a presentation)*[https://imgur.com/a/1XjVImQ](https://imgur.com/a/1XjVImQ)On June 25 the Walmart deal was announced with Walmart China, China Chain-Store Franchise Association (CCFA), and PWC and some others.The China Chain-Store Franchise Association (CCFA) is a Chinese association of **more than 1000 enterprise members** from 60 different industries and sectors. I would think this association has strong ties to the Chinese government.  We have all heard talks and rumors that VeChain could have a link to the Chinese government as well. Also we have recently seen Vechain become more accredited in China as it was added to a list of trusted blockchain companies by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (*more* *government*).Recently at a block chain summit (I think) VeChain displayed a slide showing ""**1000+ enterprise clients in the pipeline**"" This is the same way the CCFA describes the size of its member base (see above or photo).I also see that Walmart China seems to be the biggest member of the CCFA. It is listed first when examples of CCFA members are displayed (IE: the list in the bottom of the news article, The first logo in the graphic of CCFA members)Is it crazy to think that PWC just signed up the entire China Chain-Store Franchise Association (CCFA) on the VeChain deal and Walmart was chosen to go first and is carving the way for the rest of the CCFA members to come to Vechain because it is the flagship member of the association?If I remember right Jason Rockwood hinted at things like this with tweets."" *Instead of signing up one client at a time, we sign up one channel partner who has five to fifty to five hundred clients.    It has the potential to be exponential*.""He said this right after the Walmart announcement:  "" *\*I am so proud of everyone in the VeChain community who knew about Walmart and didn't leak.  It was massively difficult for all of us to hold this in, and we did it.  Thank you, you know who you are.    (\*****Now guess what other secrets I'm holding in?****)*Followed by: "" *I should have said the scale of PROJECTS is equivalent or bigger.    Hard to get a bigger client than Walmart. ""*I would say this could potentially be one big project???You guys have any thoughts on this theory or observation of mine?#>We will be adding #TeamFortress2 as our third game starting this Friday, 11 October 2019.

Good for them...#good comments!#Here u are boys:Lets start saying that in the document the word Blockchain is mentioned 25 times. And i think this is already a great news considering its an official doc issued by a government.Here some excerpt of the law financing the following activities, under the paragraph:**THE MAIN LINES OF INTERVENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM**The development of the economy requires, besides the investment in physical infrastructure, also a wide effort in the field of technological innovation and research. The Government will prepare National Strategies for Artificial Intelligence and for the Blockchain. Significant resources will be invested in broadband deployment and 5G network development.The Government will strengthen support for experimentation and adoption of digital transformations and enabling technologies that offer solutions for more **sustainable and circular production.**The Government will conclude the work for the preparation of the National Strategies for Artificial Intelligence and for the Blockchain, both developed with the support of experts. In addition to strategic planning, experiments will continue on the use of these technologies. It also intends to actively participate in the 'Digital Europe' program, which will address artificial intelligence, information security, digital skills, and the digitalisation of public administration.At the level of available funds, for the development of emerging technologies (Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Internet of Things) and wi-fi CIPE (Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning) has allocated, in October 2018, **100 million**. Moreover, with the Budget Law for 2019 a Fund was established to promote the development of technologies and applications of Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and Internet of Things, with an endowment of **15 million per year from 2019 to 2021.**PMIs (small and medium enterprises) have been granted a **non-repayable grant** for the acquisition of specialist consultancy aimed at supporting the technological and digital transformation processes through the enabling technologies envisaged by the ""Enterprise Plan 4.0"".Also in this area, in January 2019, a commission of experts was set up at the MISE (Ministry of Labour) with the task of developing a national strategy on blockchain technology and distributed registers (as u know Renato Grottola – DNV GL is in this group of experts) . A commission of experts called to draft a national strategy was also established at the same Ministry on Artificial Intelligence to define the Italian perspective with respect to what is negotiated at European level, within the framework of the coordinated plan on Artificial Intelligence.It is essential to join the ""Digital Europe"" program, with which the European Commission intends to invest **9.2 billion euros** for the development of key sectors for innovation (Supercomputers, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, digital skills, digital transformation of the Public Administration). A sector of particular interest is that of blockchain technology, increasingly central in the development of digital, both at the level of private initiative and in the public sector.With the Budget Law for 2019 (this mean last year badget law), the foundations were laid for the full operation of the National Innovation Fund (in Italian FNI).FNI also has among its missions to follow and push the most innovative emerging technologies and markets. FNI contributes directly and indirectly to the idea of development, aiming to carry out and generate investments for a total of **5 billion in 5 years**, generating at the same time qualified work with a multiplier 5.A fund of **55 million** is invested in order to provide free wi-fi to all small villages with less than 5k citizens.Here also a part related to the carbon credit platform:With reference to sustainable mobility, the Government's objective is to progressively reduce the number of vehicles with diesel and petrol engines, in order to contain polluting emissions and achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change. **A step in this direction was accomplished with the approval of the strategic plan for sustainable mobility which allocated 3.7 billion to the replacement of the bus fleet with low-impact vehicles. From 2019 to 2033, 2,000 buses will be renewed each year, in addition to 250 trains (the latter by 2022).**Consistently, in order to favor reconversion, the Budget Law for 2019 has recognized, in the three-year period 2019-2021, an economic contribution in differentiated amounts for amounts ranging from 1,500 to 6,000 euros, to the subjects who buy and register in Italy a non-polluting vehicle. The measure is accompanied by the simultaneous establishment, for the years 2019-2021, of a progressive tax on the purchases of new vehicles with CO2 emissions that exceed the threshold of 160 gr / km.The decree approved last November on the design and construction of a national system of tourist cycle routes also moves in the direction of environmental sustainability, for which the Budget Law for 2019 has made available 2 million in 2019. Integration with other forms of mobility will be obtained with the support of car and bike sharing and the construction of parking lots intermodal near the metropolitan railway and bus stations.The proposed National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan sent to European Commission aims to reduce polluting fuels in transport and to increase electric mobility, to reach the quota of 1.6 million electric cars in 2030. With the National Infrastructure Plan for the recharging of electrically powered vehicles, approximately **70 million for the construction of infrastructure networks for recharging** and restoration work on the building stock aimed at developing the same networks. The Budget Law for 2019 also introduced a new tax deduction for the purchase and installation of domestic recharging infrastructures for vehicles powered by electricity.I repeat guys, i see dots to be connected everywhere, maybe we are to hype now. This plan will probably take couple of years to be fully implemented but it is a good starting point. What do u think?#Grazie mille!#Congratz m8.

The point of blockchains is that the data is not beholden to any one government or nationality.

Thanks jeff and shoot2loot for posting the original. Had not come across this before. The total sales of all CCFA members was over 2.5 TRILLION CNY in 2013!!! Fcukkkkk. If you think about it. If Walmart wants to track their products (it’s actually a directive from the chines govt for all retailers), the tracking and tracing would have to go through the entire vertical (supply chain in this case). All suppliers, producers, distributors would HAVE to join in right? How is is supposed to work if there are gaps in the information because certain companies in the middle decided not to use the system? It simply won’t. Anyhow, we know everything will get tracked.

IF this is the case a lot of loyal investors, such as myself, will be very disappointed and it could be a sign this investment never reaches any kind of success.#Same to you too :3#Fomo? I see VeChain as being one of the very first projects will real utility and that is what will determine its value. Not fomo or speculation. I see a real use case.Transactions are what will prove the utility which is what will create the value. More transactions equal more Demand and the laws of supply and demand is create the value of this token. You do realize there is a potential that the MY STORY app will track **every single** bottle of wine exported from Italy on the Vechain block chain.Italy exports 225 million cases of wine a year. If 12 bottles in a case and each bottle has a ""story"" or tag, you can assume each bottle is 1 clause on mainnet. In a 365 day year that means 620,000 cases of 12 bottles EVERY DAY.   That is 7.4 Million clauses EVERY DAY. If 22 VTHO per clause we could burn 163 Million VTHO a day on wine. At that rate it would take 3 months to burn the entire 16 billion VTHO supply pool off of wine tracking alone.I think a lot of people still do not fully comprehend the scale of this project.#Plair has a decent partnership and backed by VeChain. It should at least be a top contender in a few years imo.#VeChain has MPP and VIP191 and other blockchains don't. Try onboarding users that have to pay for every tx. Good luck.

Even as big as Walmart is, if it were the only retailer with the tracing/tracking requirements, everyone involved in their supply chain could tell them to take a hike. However, when you sign every retailer, it gives them the leverage to demand the links in their supply chain comply in order to keep their own businesses viable. As someone that has been in IT project management, signing the entire lot makes a ton of sense from that side of the house as well. By getting everyone involved and at the table from the outset, you can create a framework and systems that are universally adoptable which will/should drive implementation costs down and make it quicker to bring it into production.#[removed]#Does it have to be on a specific wallet?#[removed]#Don’t forget to click the Upgrade button!  You DO NOT have a node with just a millie VET sitting in mobile wallet#I'm also disappointed by the downturn in transactions, but it's kind of funny at the same time.  333 million VTHO in 60 days is a 180-day burnrate for 1billion VTHO.  That's less than half the time (403 days) it took to burn the first billion.  We ought to be extremely excited about that halving and hope the results continue to extrapolate going forward.  A halving after the next billion would mean the third billion will take 90 days... and the fourth billion 45 days.... and the fifth billion 22 days :D#Speculation is San Marino wallets being set up but no one knows for sure.#Yes so it looks like every transaction is originated from this wallet  0xB73554767983Dc5aAEAC2b948E407f57e8E9Dea1And is being sent into this wallet/contract0x2F41b47F10fD85A6Ea6EC2EB4eA6387608ac93D6&#x200B Each transaction is also creating a new address or wallet.

Smells like BS to me.  Once prices begin to be correlated to real earnings they will swing with the stock market. Pure currencies may remain aligned with BTC but there's no reason at all to think coins providing a service will. > I’m done with falling for pleb narratives since time ago and now just listening to market Listening to a market in a purely speculative phase isn't going to give you guidance on how it behaves once it leaves that phase.

Walmart tells their suppliers exactly how much they’re going to pay for their product and that’s end of story. Walmart has a 50 page rule book that their suppliers must follow.

FF7 got me for good#I think about it at the end of the line. A customer at a supermakret will buy one maybe two bottles off the shelf and want to see the ""Story"" of the single bottle: Packaging Date, Shipping, Geo Location info ect. I guess you could track the case only but you still need a tag on each bottle displaying the information for the case because it will eventually be split between customers. All 12 tags would be identical and lead you to the same page of information on MY Story.  BUT to do this you have to guarantee all 12 bottles came from the same place are the same flavor and were packed on the same day and time ect. What if it is the end of a production day and the winery only has 6 bottles done and not the full 12 in a case. The other 6 wont be done until the next working day (weekend gap maybe also). How do you identify the date for the case of 12 for tracking? Is it the Friday the first 6 were made or is the date for the case the Monday the final 6 were made? In batch tracking you can only have one date.  You lose some accuracy by tracking just the entire case.  If each individual bottle is tracked then 6 can be dated Friday and the other 6 dated Monday but they are all in the same case. Do cases of 6 red wine and 6 white wine exist (variety case)? How do you track these 12 as a group if they are made from different ingredients in a different place or different time of year? If you are going to do it make it as accurate as possible is my thought? The whole goal is validation it is a real and safe product. If I buy a high dollar bottle of Italian wine I want to scan the label and see **its** story... not the story of it and its 11 brothers who may or may not be exactly identical to my bottle. Second thought its batch tracking could potentially make it easier to scam the system. We only have info  on the batch of 12 as a group. Slide a few fakes in there and take some of the real ones and someone may never know part of the group is tainted or fake now.#I did a wine tasting recently with some friends.  We did a comparison between Willamette Valley and Russian River wine appellations.  We spent around $250 on wine on 10 bottles of wine.   3 out of the 5 Willamette Valley bottles we bought were vinegar.  They were all from different wineries.You ask:  What benefit would there be for every bottle to have a unique entry?Well, in my example we would be able to scan the label and understand exactly what went wrong and where.I suspect that 3 the bottles all came from the same distributor and were shipped together and at some point along the line was exposed to significant heat. Not sure whether it was in storage or during transportation.     With Vechain, it is a simple scan on the label and quick comparison between the 3 and we would have our answers.     Currently, they would have had to compare the receiving history for each bottle, then gone to the distributor and each winery to ask about the lot numbers and then follow it up the distribution pathway.   5 minutes vs 5 days.&#x200B That wine shop was NOT HAPPY to have to take back that many bottles all at once because they realized they likely had a bigger problem.  Vechain would have helped them understand that problem a hell of a lot quicker.#Simple:   So the customer buying a single bottle can scan for info#2023 is what I am looking at . Big vet moon then#But you do not know that for sure. It is apparent to me as I just mentioned the ground work and infrastructure of the block chain is built. It is ready to go on any scale its customers could ask of it. It is basically sitting at idle right now literally waiting to be feed transactions day and night.We are now just waiting on the businesses to be ready and able to provide those transactions. DVN-GL has spent months and months getting ready and is about to launch 900,000 wallets( 6x the current number of wallets) and they are behind the MY STORY app as well. If I am a company as big as they are why do I launch a massive amount of wallets and development on the blockchain if I do not have the transactions to support them?It is all coming and I think faster than most realize. I think it is very possible we are burning more VTHO than we generate within 6 months.#I remember DS9, although not quite so deep :) I thought you were quoting 1985#There is a difference between Walmart's rule book and pushing massive capex/opex expenses on supply chain partners. We're talking complete, complex IT processes and systems overhauls (that are bleeding edge to boot) that your smaller organizations just wouldn't be able to accomplish no matter what Walmart attempted to dictate.#No.  Click button ASAP @ 1 mill, then wait the 10 days#Lol, your joking right?I’ll take a stab and say in 6 months we will be averaging 500mil over a 60 day period!#Very true, and we can agree to differ. My take is in Vechains case, doing millions perhaps billions of transactions every day at its mature peak in the years ahead, then btc will just not have the muscle to influence its price just because its having 'a bad day'#Thanks bb#Ff7 remake and last of us 2 coming within a few weeks of each other.......hoooly sheet. Not sure how PS4 can be overlooked.#Additional thought I just had is the ability to backtrack individual bottles. If you have a customer with a bottle that is bad and made them sick (ect.). It can be reported and they can now back track that individual bottle to try to isolate the problem. Otherwise they have to back track just the group and speculate if the entire batch is bad or not. If its a bad batch, how do you find the other 11 if they are grouped as a batch under one ID? If each bottle has a unique ID they would be easier to track back down one by one.#Thanks for example. That use case makes sense. Let’s just hope they see it that way too from the outset and have unique tags to every bottle. The numbers for Vtho burned above just sound too good to be true so here’s wishing this goes our way! And, thanks for replying back to a message from an old daily, appreciate it!#For the above to happen, the entire wine supply chain and infrastructure needs overhauling. Every step needs equipment, training, implementation etc. I believe that will take time. We are not talking about one or two suppliers.(Btw, I think it was delloite that mentioned the 900k wallets, though I may be wrong).#I hear you. I run IT for a publicly traded company (once technical, currently management). However, a small organization (who was probably popping champagne bottles when Walmart brought them on board) is not going to dictate what Walmart does. They’ll either make the adjustment or Walmart will tell them to take a hike, not the other way around. They can be easily replaced. You're telling me Walmart can't source mushrooms from someone else?Actually wait a minute.....WALMART, if you're reading this. Let me know if any of your supplies aren't cuttin' it. I'll gladly step in and make it happen.#Yes it was intended as a joke.  I was extrapolating the figures down to a ridiculous level.#Do you not think they have been working on that the last few months? I fully agree it will not go live and we get 100% on day one but in 6 months from now we could have 20% (maybe more, maybe less) of the wine, add that to the Carbon Credit App, Walmart, BMW, This, That, could have a PWC US deal by then.  **The potential for transactions to start flooding in from several different avenues in the next 6 months is huge**. Sunny has mentioned several times 2020 is the start of real adoption. Everything I am seeing is hinting at that to be true.#Apparently I don’t have a sense of humour 😂#For what it's worth, I found your joke funny :)    Food for thought though: If the singularity ever comes to pass, we might actually see something approaching that level of burn, even if the burn rate doesn't strictly double like that."

DCA#And we are all reminded how much Bitcoin influences this market. I know this has been a rough week but I see this as a buying opportunity. Price is cheap.  Always trying to stay positive.I just spent some time looking at this  [https://visuals.veblocks.net/](https://visuals.veblocks.net/)  explorer posted by a user yesterday. You can clearly see 5 short spikes in activity for the current day. Just doing a quick visual they only seem to last 5-15 minutes each of solid activity.  My quick estimate shows we only really have **48 mins total worth** of solid consistent activity in the 16 hours of today. Basically only seeing activity for **5% of the day so far (16 hours).** So 95% of the time mainnet is just kind of at idle. This is a reminder of how early we truly are in this project.A solid 33% (one third) of a 24 hour day of activity would be huge. This is still only about 8 hours worth of a 24 hour day. I look forward to these kind of days.To add to this, I think our first big goal is to **10x from where we are now**. The last 3 days we have consistently seen 100,000+ clauses with a VTHO burn of  about 4.0-4.5 million. If we 10x from here we will see a consistent 1 million clauses a day and VTHO burn on 40 to 45 million. **This is 3 to 8 million VTHO more than the generation rate.** This is where we will start to see real value and hopefully the Utility will start to break us away from the influences of Bitcoin. The only question is how long will it take to get to this point.Just some things to think about. For now I am going to look at grabbing a few hundred thousand more VET. Hard to not want to buy more at these prices.#210 million VET needs to be bought to get to 42 sats. 216 million VET needs to be sold to get to 0 sats.To go up 2 sats it takes just as much as to go to literal zero. Insane.#My strength node doesn’t even cover the cost of my Hulu Basic anymore.#Getting interesting now, I'm 1 million away from a Thunder x. Time to load up some FIAT to prepare some final barrels. Good luck with your timing Veterans.#[deleted]#when moon#How is VTHO dropping more than another gas token that has 150x less use ? Too much vtho produced ?#What depresses me the most if that we went x2 today,.. we would still be just 0.061.#Idk about anyone else but I get FOMO when the price drops. Fear of Missing Omega gains#[deleted]#Happy Hump Day To All#Is there a way to access my VET on my ledger atm?Or I need to wait a while? Thanks!#:(#Are we still buying VET?#Is the Foundation buying back another $5mil worth of VET this quarter?Looks like they are down $2mil from the VET purchased last quarter. =(#I'm surprised VeChain still has enough money to keep going. Can't get much now-a-days dumping at these low prices.#While the benefits are still questionable. One could pick up an x node from the marketplace for about $1,500 usd  at this rate. Not too shabby considering the usd investment figure originally required to obtain an x node. Only 3 or 4 on the marketplace and only one under 500,000 vet currently. About a month ago they were going for like 700,000 vet (not sure if any sold at that rate)#I want to buy right now.But what's the point... There's well over 200 million vet at the next 3 sats. Those ain't going anywhere anytime.Price literally cannot go up right now.#Anyone know what Aqua diamond token(AQD) is? It showed up in my official wallet but I can't find any other information on it?#Mainnet going well today#All time day record indeed, and still going strong...#Thank you for calling, please hodl.#on the bright side... every suicide means a coinburn if you hide your private keys on a good place :D. #sorrynotsorry#Here is the solution: Buy SHA. SHA is on the rise, while the rest of crypto seems to be plummeting. :)#The token economics are dependent on a critical mass of VTHO being burned everyday. We don’t have that yet, BUT, given the scope of projects yet to come, we will. We almost managed it a month or two ago when we had a huge burst in Tx. We almost exceeded the daily generation rate of VTHO. We have to maintain this. That’s when scarcity and value and consistent demand for VTHO will start to create organic value outside of bitcoin. Until then, we are a floating along an Ocean following the current. VeChain is fundamentally very strong. It just needs enough time for math to kick in. Use cases coming online in 2020 including DNVGL rolling out their solutions in a commercial way, past the POC stage. Don’t let price dictate your sentiment, as tough as that is sometimes. Focus on fundamentals and invest time understanding the scope and value of blockchain to the future economy. That, as well as knowing you have some of the largest companies and governments leveraging their client networks and economies to build on VeChain should hopefully help you see the light at the end of the tunnel.#What VeChain offers in the business world and what their team brings to the table...no other current crypto comes close.What you have to realize however...is all of crypto is tied to bitcoin and bitcoin is heavily manipulated. Either ride the train all the way down...or get out and come back after Bitfinex/Tether explode. Bitcoin is going below $1k#Btc is going for a big dip for a while me thinks#Thank you so much. That was much needed#good luck.#Wow that’s a heavy bag. Good luck#Look at all the financial advisors...Good luck brother!#Who gets tax refunds in October?#I'd wait a few weeks. It doesn't feel like a reversal is around the corner.#I'm waiting also since 3 months... lazy Student  life. But trying  so pick  up some more then#Maybe buy some vet, keep some fiat. Be careful.#Dude.. diversify.#I have some gold and silver I could trade in but that’s breaking the cardinal rule I set for myself when I started in crypto. I already have a way higher crypto/metals ratio than planned#As Vechain is relatively unknown yet, I think they do not want some nutties misrepresenting the brand/foundation. That's my 2 cents on it as of now.#All boils down to the moment vechain has stable 1mil+ tx daily#Really enjoying your posts, cheers. Got paid a few days ago, so I'll be doing the same.#Thanks for all of your hard work researching this project Jeff! You are keeping me positive. I'm invested a lot more than I should be (not the end of the world as there's always more money to be made) but I'm going to ride this out. Thanks again man.#For the people downvoting because they are angry at the price, go ahead and let your emotions dictate your behavior. But also know I am down thousands and thousands of dollars and I just starting buy VET earlier this year. I will not fall victim to this price manipulation, I am not selling and I WILL ride this thing to zero before I abandon ship. I fully understand a day could come where this thing is worth $0 (highly unlikely) and if so I will handle it according and move on with my life. I however will not be able to handle abandoning now only to see this thing worth multiple dollars per VET in the future.  I will sink with this ship before I put myself on the sidelines and watch it soar from there.#Theoretically it is easy to break away from BTC....just remove all BTC/VET pairings. Only reason coins move in tandem is that a drop in BTC lowers the BTC pairings value and the algo bots follow suite by lowering the USDT pairings. Most reputable exchanges now have USDT/VET pairings...force people to trade BTC to USDT before buying VET.  But that ain't happening.#I got out at $.0074 because Bitcoin is going down to $700. Wait until Bitfinex explodes and come back after a couple months. I like the hopeium, but don’t fight down trendsEdit: $.0074#It means there are few ppl willing to sell low#Time to upgrade then /s#One thing to keep in mind - activating the upgrade to a Thunder X will restrict you from offloading VET down the line if you want to keep your X Node.Hypothetically speaking - I'd be accumulating, but not activating that upgrade until I'm well over the 5.6 threshold.Good luck!#At this rate, I might also slowly accumulate enough to get me a Thunder node.#Lock tokens forever for an additional 2 bucks a month. Sounds like a great deal.#I've done that a few times.Time to do it again I guess.#I bought more VET at 0.0043 (CAD) yesterday. Today it's at 0.0038. I can't afford to buy more atm. Needless to say, I'm pretty pissed.#Tonite.#Destination: Moon, Route taken: Through the earths core#Likely answer is currently a lot of people swapping VTHO for VET, creates selling pressure on the pair.#.0061#0.0058 now#Same, the bigger the drop, the more unhappy comments, the harder I FOMO#I’m in the US and am still using Binance. Is that not allowed?#I think Kucoin is sn option too#Buy xrpSend them to bitrue Buy vet with xrp#Don't send BTC. Send LTC#Voyager app. USD -> VET#That's what I do. all in all takes an hour or so.#Bitcoin took that too literally and rolled off the other side of the hump#You have to wait for like one week until VeChain releases the ledger client.#Oof! We’re dumping this hard and some people can’t even access their VET to sell yet#:)#I finished buying a month ago. Yet I keep putting some in each week just anything extra I feel the need I can live without. It's great because I can up the coins I can sell next bull run and not lose my X.#I know it is hard to lose a significant amount of money, but the way i see it you can view the actual situation in two scenario’s:1. Think with your heart and decide it is enough. Sell, diversify more or simply stop investing. The road to profit will take longer, but i still believe we eventually will get there. I assume the majority of investors acts this way.2. Think with your head, look at the evolution of the fundamentals, scope and progress of the project and adjust your timeframe for profit. Invest what you can afford to lose, and keep on dca’ing. I believe the road to profit will be shorter and the possibility to create wealth is far bigger. If things pick up as planned, growth will be exponential.Ps: i am an original x-node owner and have upgraded to a higher node twice already. As the most of you, i am deep in the red. I have only changed the way I invest, from a couple of big investments to high frequent smaller investments to spread the risk. This is however not financial advice, just my personal opinion.#[deleted]#Hells yeah boiiiii. All about that 2021 Vision for me#Yes, we are.  Seems like we are the only ones though.#BTC baby#Except they're buying it back with money they made from selling it to us in the first place. I doubt the fact that the price dropped really bothers them when they sold high to begin with.#Thats a major benefit of being a cash earning business and not being solely dependent on their token value for funding. They’ve also got a $500M fund from a variety of investment sources for ecosystem expansion. This was announced in April at the VeChain Summit#Props to you for still having the stomach to commit your hard earned VET into to an x-node#Then again 1,500 usd gives you a nice chunk of VET by itself as well.#I've seen you around here for a while, you've been a positive part of the community. Nothing wrong with venting some frustration, I hear you.#[deleted]#Maybe diamonds on the blockchain. Nobody knows.#Kinda hard to interpret. Almost feels like a social credit concept to me.http://www.aquaworld.io/> • Content eco-value community built on the core concept of credit, namely wealth, data, value, consumption and investment> > • A carrier of distributed business ecology built around the user, content and scenarios, using the economics of the economy#I remember an Aqua logo from several events Vechain attended. If it's them, they are around for some time#😂#In several instances, these ""big partnerships"" are nothing but a small POC with a little department in that large corporation. I've seen too many of those kinds of announcements to really bother about them anymore. Even DNVGL with 900K wallets, not sure how many will actually use it. Having wallets is one thing and usage is quite another. We shall see.#Yeah, I filed an extension. I have a business and overpaid my estimated taxes, so I got a good chunk of money back.#People who file for postponement.#Think I might just start selling crack. Thoughts?#I think you and I, as well as a few others on here have been saying this for a while. Just a waiting game.#Honestly this is the one crypto I am actually in for the technology. We need this. The world needs it. Customers need to be able to see exactly where their food comes from. I won’t pay almost 2x the $ for organic or sustainably sourced food without proof so there is absolutely a financial incentive for companies if they use public blockchain. And I don’t understand how the carbon credits will exactly be implemented yet (but I can take a guess) but the world needs that too.But at the same time I’ve kinda hit the max I’m willing to invest. There’s cars on craigslist I’d love to buy for the amount I’ve put into VET alone#Don’t let the downvotes get you. Sometimes we get trolled with downvoters, could be nothing. You make an accurate observation, nothing to defend. BTC steers the ship for now, it’s true. Our day will come. Blockchain is going to be economically significant technology. The way to get your foot in the door is be the de facto blockchain for industrial applications, and we have that foot in the door. The rest is time and development. This technology will mature and things will look vastly different in the future. DNVGL have been instrumental in setting various international standards. It should be no surprise they are pushing to set their blockchain of choice as the standard of the future.#This!#700 or 7000? If you believe $700 then wow. I am not fighting your short term trends. I am buying for the long term trend. The long term shows Bitcoin to be the best performing asset of the last 10 years. Long term trend for VeChain (5 years) will be growth, just takes some patience.#What a BS. Peope keep talking as bitcoin' behaviour can be predicted#[deleted]#Just the other way around, few people willing to BUY low since the order books on the buy side are so low compared to the sell side.#When the totient labs thing came out, I got scared a bit. The way Vechain handled it and also when all details came out, it gives me confidence enough to go for it. The only thing I'll be selling in 1-2 years is VTHO  ). I told my boss today how deep I'm in and he was a bit shocked. It's a large and risky investment but what else should I have done apart from just saving the last 1-2 years? We all know the stock market has basically peaked out and it's just waiting for the burst. Might as well take a risk on something you really feel positive about and support.#Assuming all VET supply (86.7B VET) was evenly divided such that all VET holders held at minimum a Thunder node (5M VET), there would only be 17,342 Thunder nodes available. But that’s not the case. Luckily there are Thrudheim Authority Nodes carrying helluva more weight so to have at least a Thunder will be a pretty rare occurrence. Definitely a goal to shoot for!#Dum dum. I'm not investing to get 2 bucks a month. I'm investing because I think one day it will be waaaay more than that. If this is what I was investing for right now I'd sell it all and ditch this project forever.#remindme! tonight#I have the same question as you. All I hear is that binance is unavailable in the US. I've been going cash app (btc) to binance for the past couple years with the latest vet purchase being a week ago. Still works for me#well this is indeed the fastest way. BUT the volume in the vet/xrp is way too low so you can almost never buy vet at the current price. and if you make a market order you buy at a higher price and lose too much. best way imo is still to buy eth / btc (eth is quicker) , send it to binance or oceanex and use the eth,btc /vet pair.(edit : talking about trades of +$1000. if you buy $50 then buying xrp first works fine sometimes.)#Is there enough liquidity on the VET/LTC pair though?  Last time I wanted to avoid time/fees associated with BC, I used ETH.  It was much quicker to get it over to OceanEx, but there was so little volume that I canceled my order after it sitting there as the highest bid for over an hour.#[deleted]#[deleted]#I think the whole market mistook ""Hump Day"" for ""Dump Day"".#I, for one, upvoted you. not exactly sure why because at times like these a man certainly questions the decision he'd made and held on to only to see it turn from bad to worse... not entirely sure this will ever recover as of now (and charts are a bitch to look at for the past year and a half), but from this point on - it's probably worth riding it to 0 if that's the case. just feeling stupid, because nothing really indicated such an outcome from a fundamental perspective..#You have the 'head' and 'heart' the wrong way around. It has been a sustained and steady drop since September last year despite the great developments. There is nothing to suggest this will suddenly reverse.#Barley#They’re using the ecosystem fund that they raised with various investors for the buyback. Plz don’t start making accusations without merit. The VET that is released is used for various development purposes and is laid out in the financial reports. Said VET was always going to be released as well, that’s the only way all tokens enter circulation, they were always going to be sold. The market crashing certainly impacts them as they still have to release tokens which, having less value means less development money for them, which is the most important thing at this stage. They need to get this network on its feet otherwise no one will benefit.#This is not said enough, vechain don’t need a token with value they need companies signing there contracts which are paying them in fiat, something to think about.#Lol 500 million and they can't even help the company that had the official blockexplorer and until just a week ago were bragging them up..tolient is a huge loss imo and I am guessing they know something we don't#This is also true. But assuming the project succeeds and the benefits start being worth it, then you could always sell the xnode and get back your vet. Maybe more vet maybe less. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯#You're going to block me from the sub for being negative?#What fucking price rises!?#You’re right, everything starts out as a POC, that much is true. We’re seeing projects pass POC now, which is encouraging for the future of the tech, now its a case of time. Blockchain is an integral part of industry 4.0, but not everything will need blockchain. Still, it’s a huge pie out there.#Renato just a few weeks ago (September): ""the proof of concept era has come to an end"". Here's to hoping!#Not a horrible time to purchase  ) good on you!#Round here VET is the crack#I fully back your decision and would like to go into business with you if you're open to it,#Honestly it’s a great idea. Especially if you’re a moderately well off, educated person. Molly or coke at the clubs#Wise words, at least some people see the same picture I am seeing. Also the down votes really dont bother me, I just wanted to make it public I am solid on this investment and will continue to be.#I love VeChain, Jur,  OceanEx, and Plair. They seem like great things to be involved in and have the potential to really disrupt things. However, I’m not willing to take on anything greater than a 5% loss. Bitcoin still looks like its going to get below $1k. That’s more than 90%. Unfortunately, it’s taking all of crypto with it#$700. Below $1k. Bitcoin is a terrible product. Bitcoin has only been driven up by shady exchanges. 2020 will be the year bitcoin finally burns (hopefully for good), and hopefully blockchain technology is finally given the stage#Bitcoin doesn't ""behave"" in any way.

I think ripple is low too but not sure if that's an option on Coinbase.#Nah, I use a debit card for crypto and it's ready right away. 7,500 limit a week so should be more than enough to get buys in fast.#you cannot withdraw btc for the first 5-7 business days#i agree losing money is stupid. but in my point of view i dont see a reason to sell now. and if the price loses another 50% i  have even less reason to sell. ofcourse that was also my point of view 1 year ago and that didnt turned out well. but hey... i ride this thing to 0 if thats what it takes.guess im closing my eyes and putting my trust in the hands of the team. i guess i will see how it turns out... cheers to all holders who lost lots of money. try never to get salty. :high-five:#I mean, eventually it will rise. It's just the nature of business. They have real world partnerships that are working on products.#He is not talking about suddenly. And it is better to buy low than high.#It's not making stuff up at all. You think they would be using funds for buy backs if they had not already raised money through the ICO and the ongoing selling of tokens? I don't. Regardless of which account they are debiting the money for buybacks from, it's enabled by the fact that they sold tokens to retail investors and they've done so at higher prices for almost two years. Now they are buying those exact same tokens back that they sold to us in the first place.#That fiat buys VTHO ultimately, and token value comes by proxy of usage. But yes, in terms of the volatility of the market VeChain is insulated by real world cash flow.#Totient is two guys with a setup in California who just wanted more money. VeForge was cool and all but obviously it was no bargaining chip and not worth the foundation to pay them a bunch of money for. This is far from a ""huge"" loss.A huge loss would be losing  DVN-GL or PWC or Walmart or BYD or PICC or.... should I keep going.#[deleted]#Relevant and by far my favourite tweet from Renato:https://twitter.com/rgrottola/status/1128670322058780673?s=19Exponential. He wouldn't use that term lightly.#Totally. We’re speculating on future value, after all. No blockchains are delivering much economic value currently, this whole market is driven by speculation and most of it is intrinsically worth nothing. It’s the birth of a new tech era, it’s going to be tumultuous for sure! I truly believe we will witness the births of the next titans of industry though. Mass adoption is coming and those providers have huge markets to take advantage of. Real world value driven by real world activity and organic demand for GAS to write data.#366 karma after 4 years.. now i see why#The one thing i hate more than a bear market is people that talk as if its all calculated and act like they've made all the right moves. This is an unregulated, high volatile and unpredictive market... SOOO please dont take it wrong when i say 'stfu and keep travelling arthur'#You must be a millionaire then, since it's as easy as looking at a chart.#You are right. My hedge is my savings account ). No after the Thunder X. I am done and let it play out. Apart from LINK I have no other crypto investments as I do not see the longterm value ( sorry BTC fans).#Do not understand a downvote to you fren, upvoted. Good advice.#[removed]#[removed]#Didn't mean to make fun of anyone or anything. Just trying to understand the rationale. You can always lock it up at higher levels later if it actually proves to be worth it.#If you use your checking account you wait. Use your debit card its instant#I definitely wouldn't assume that. Crypto markets tend to be cyclical but there's no guarantee of any one project seeing gains. We could have already seen the highest price Vechain will ever reach. There's no way to know for now.#[deleted]#The first line of the comment is making a wrong accusation. It’s a slippery slope because people quickly then start repeating such things, we have to keep reality in check, that’s all I’m saying. The tokens were sold in to circulation to fund the business, true. That’s all laid out in the whitepaper (self funded 2018/2019) and financial reports so it shouldn’t be a surprise. They only have about 11B tokens left though and 2020 is the first year when they turn a significant portion of revenue from products, so, hopefully things should turn around next year. 2021-2022 is when they become revenue positive and then beyond that, profit. That’s their own stated timelines on things, for your own information. That revenue = demand on chain which is good for everyone.#One day it might be buying vtho but surely the 30-40% of total vet supply they own is enough to currently generate the vtho needed at this time.#With the work Fabian has done the past 3 days it begs the question of “what did totient do for a year instead of improving veforge?”#Ahh.. Ok that is different. I guess I'm negative because there are so many negative things right now. Price sucks, txs way down, buyback isn't doing much, veforge thing happened. Hopefully I can get more positive when more positive things happen.#1. Thanks for the good words. Europe is next in the list 🤙🏻2. Meh. Not all the right moves. I got out at .0074 and the next day VeChain went to .008. Been wrong on when to short gold too. However with that being said...charts and trends don’t lie#That's why I had it in quotes#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Vechain) if you have any questions or concerns.*#If I already have the tokens now, why won't I just lock it for more VTHO? If I'm getting tokens only when it ""proves to be worth it"", it'll be too late.#Just looking at current market cap. Real world use and funding will boost it.#Sunny is letting businesses announce themselves. Also, give it time man. 2020 is slated to be a good year already - don't worry about price right now.#You're right. It's not a surprise or even necessarily a bad thing. My point is only that they get zero sympathy from me for having the price of what they bought from us drop when they were the ones who created it from thin air and sold it to us in the first place, and at higher prices. The people who experienced the price drop are the retail investors. Not Vechain.#61B are in circulation and 12.5B are for node rewards which is 73.5B total out of 85Billion tokens meaning at most they have 11.5B in their possession, way less than 30-40% of total VET supply. That generates just over 50M VTHO a day. We hit 35M not that long ago, albeit it for one day. When things pick up, their stash quickly won’t be able to keep up with demand. And in any case, a user has already shown the trail of VTHO from OceanEx to active contracts so it’s already being bought from the market.#I agree with this 100% VeChainStats.com is my go to website right now. As previously stated Totient was not a big loss and this is even further proof.#[deleted]#People tend to value negative things more than positive ones . I guess you forgot the news about Deloitte , dnvgl, possible pwc us Deal etc ? Also the fact that vechain is visiting basically every major blockchain event ... these guys aren’t sleeping#Charts and trends have for sure been known to lie#In relation to OP? I see.. that’s fair enough. You’re entitled to your opinions. Sorry for knee-jerk reacting on you.#Well not good but the point is veforge was never that great#Don’t know what charts you’re looking at.It’s clear since 2009 it’s a good time to buy stocks (might be ending soon though),  the Pound Sterling has been getting killed since 2017, and gold became a great buy December 2018. Trends don’t lie. Your choice to embrace or fight 🤷🏻‍♂️"

Once again for the second day in a row we have posted over 30,000 VIP191 clauses in the first 3 hours of the day. A week ago we basically had 0 VIP191 clauses on the day. These are are new transactions from a new souce. Yesterday we have over 50,000 VIP191 for the whole day. Hoping to see something similar later today. The speed at which this new transactions grow could be very important.  As far as your Walmart comment we only have 4,000 MPP data clauses. Walmart is currently not active on VeChain and the majority of the MPP clauses will come later in the day. We had about 70,000 total yesterday.#I did this enough to pull my VET DCA down to 1.2c. Portfolio value -66% lol.#i think this depends from country to country. anyway, if the irs wanna collect some gains off me i got some bad news for them xD#I won't pretend to know the rules or be an expert on this, but if they consider every VTHO generation event (which is basically constant) to be a taxable transaction that becomes kind of ridiculous to track and record. I think you would probably be safe reporting the moment you use the VTHO for another transaction (trade on an exchange) to be the moment you 'receive' it for pricing purposes. Otherwise, just storing VET in a wallet would require you to keep records of VTHO price constantly for what likely amounts to only miniscule deposits at a time.#Nothing has changed, it’s been taxable income the second you receive it since day one. If your generation is immaterial (like less than 1k/year) I just wouldn’t report it.#Fascinating#The VTHO generation rate is based on each individual VET token you own. Currently the generation rate is **0.000432 VTHO each day per every VET you own**. You own 100 VET you generate .0432 VTHO a day...... 10,000 VET generates 4.32 VTHO per day....... 1 Million VET is 432 VTHO per day and so on. It is a fixed ratio using simple math.When you add in Nodes they have a fixed ratio of additional bonus generation on top of the base generation listed above.  *Where X is the total number of VET you hold in your account. Total Rate = Base(x)+Node Bonus(X)*1. Strength Node bonus rate   = **.00009136\_\_\_\_\_\_**              Total Rate = .000432(X) + .00009136(X)2. Thunder Node bonus rate   = **.00013704\_\_\_\_\_\_**              Total Rate = .000432(X) + .00013704(X)3. Mjolnir Node  bonus rate     = **.00018272\_\_\_\_\_\_**              Total Rate = .000432(X) + .00018272(X)4. VeThor X Node bonus rate   = **.00001763\_\_\_\_\_\_**              Total Rate = .000432(X) + .00001763(X)5. Strength X Node bonus rate = **.00016187\_\_\_\_\_**             Total Rate = .000432(X) + .00016187(X)6. Thunder X Node bonus rate = **.00024280\_\_\_\_\_\_**              Total Rate = .000432(X) + .00024280(X)7. Mjolnir X Node bonus rate    = **.00032374\_\_\_\_\_\_**              Total Rate = .000432(X) + .00032374(X)It is strictly based on the number of VET you hold, the amount of fiat you payed to acquire the VET has no weight in the generation of VTHO. Also the base generation rate of .000432 will never decrease, it can only be increased to generate more VTHO if the blockchain needs in the future. I am not sure if the node bonus rates will increase also but I would suspect one day they could.The second option (*instead of increasing the generation rates*) to help regulate supply of VTHO is the lower the VTHO amount need for gas of each transaction.#1 mio VET produces 432 vtho a day now, doesn’t matter how many dollars you spend on that VET.#Spending 4k on VET now produces more VTHO than spending 4k on VET once the price rises.That's if the price goes up (which we all hope it's going to)#[removed]#:)#Wise words from the Dalai Lama himself#Thank you friend.#Said, ""I, I, I, I want the knife...."" jk good stuff Solomon !#[deleted]#Good to know !#I really appreciate it - you aren't the first to suggest this and is the route I will likely go.#Yep, just wish good dental insurance was more easily obtainable in this country#Money aside, how is it?

The real question for me is can we maintain a good numbers over the weekend.

It is also the node requiring the least amount of holdings to retain. \*These numbers were all calculated using [VeChainStats.com](https://VeChainStats.com) and I believe them to be accurate.#Thanks a lot for your detailed answer!#This. Vtho production is linked to vet. The price you buy vet for has literally zero affect on how much vtho it produces.Do not invest a dime until you understand this concept fully.#Haha you are not wrong my friend. Hopefully $4,000 buys you significantly more VET today then in will in a year from now. I know plenty of people have been adding the last week or so. Currently almost 60 people are in the process of upgrading to a Strength node, lot of people just recently broke the 1 million VET barrier because of these low prices.#[removed]#Ha's#You’re a funny one, Wayland :) good find with the NIC!

There is time for everything. X nodes were for distribution phase and buyback is for accumulation. Everything is planned#Why do you think it will take that long?#Your numbers are only accurate at this specific snapshot in time.  The node bonuses also take into account the number of tokens locked up in the node pools, and that number fluctuates over time.  For instance, if the total VET locked up in econ nodes was 10 billion, and you have 1 million VET, you will receive 1/1000 of the VTHO generated from the economic pool.Likewise, if the total VET locked up in econ nodes was 5 billion, and you have 1 million VET, you will receive 1/500 of the VTHO generated from the economic pool.#Hey guys, this is a blockchain forum and VeChain is a global business.

Am stoked to see UK involvement though for real ! :)#[deleted]#Oh fuck, mine are in an awkward position too. That's why I wasn't brushing them properly.#This is true, says it right at the top, but they just released it a few weeks ago. It will definitely be a couple of months before we see another. I wonder why the odd timing of the quarters. Could be february start of year based on chinese new year#Ah, I didn't realise. Any idea how?#In section 3.4.3 they say they'll adjust VTHO fees first, then increase generation velocity if they still can't stabilize cost. Here's a couple problems I see with increasing VTHO generation and probably why it's not Vechain's preferred solution:* All VTHO before that point will be devalued and previous holders will have essentially paid a premium. Not good for me since I've been holding. * It's not guaranteed to control transaction costs. If transaction costs go up, yes, they could flood the market with VTHO to bring it down but it's not guaranteed. People could still speculate and hoard their VTHO causing price to continue to go up. The only guaranteed way is to just change the amount of VTHO required. Rumors have said that can be done on the fly and wouldn't require a hard fork like increasing the gen rate. I do think they should decrease the gen rate for non-x nodes wallets to make x nodes more desirable. Like you said in a previous post, in a lot of cases, it makes sense to NOT buy an x node and just put that money towards VET itself. The only time it makes sense to purchase an x node is if you're a large organization and are holding tens of millions of VET. Then again, maybe that's why they designed it that way. Anyways, I'm excited to see what changes Sunny and team have in store for the new whitepaper. I have faith they'll do right by their early supporters. Your thoughts?#You can't trust the chart. 1 BTC dip and VeChain goes with it. Just wait for real life in production transactions. And even that doesn't mean the price will go higher.So you are saying VeChain is manipulating the price??#You are correct but it is my assumption an update to the Whitepaper will come out explaining the new structure before the next reduction to the economic node pool. The current paper only really outlines a plan until we get down to 10 billion in the pool or the end of 2019. I expect these numbers above to stay the same until the foundation gives the next big update on the future rewards for economic nodes.#I think you need a good old cup o’ tea, g’uvna!#Yes#Haha wish I could brush them. They didn't even come trough because they were lying completely horizontal, right on a nerve.Edit  but good luck man!#Mine have “flaps” over them and are not fully grown in.   Get a Waterpik and your wisdom teeth will be a lot happier!#Businesses don’t typically follow the calendar year when it comes to financials. It’s usually lined up according to business needs. They’ll even line it up so the fourth quarter is always the strongest so they can end on a high note. Our company fiscal year begins in April.#I approved it and it seems visible Now. But that wasn’t the case before with WeChat. Weird.I would advise just taking out the https:// and not making it a pressable link but explain to add that in or something. To be fair, it looks fine. At least you know for the future :)#Agreed.  They should change the VTHO fee first.  Like you I am hoarding VTHO.#>So you are saying VeChain is manipulating the price??VeChain is doing smart strategical planning.  General public likes to scream ""manipulation"" at everything they don't understand.#Chart and analyzing movements of vet on the public blockchain are the two only things I really trust. Everything else is just words and imagination. I learned a lot since 2017 and could care less if general public agrees with me or notPeople lie, fud or hype (“should be 1$ by Sept” lol, “once in a lifetime X node opportunity” lol). Chart and the blockchain don’t. If something big is really brewing and insiders know that, you’ll see it in the chart.#The numbers vary with the size of the pool, but they \*also\* vary with the total number of VET held by node token holders.#Ha's. I do say my good chap invite the shire reeve !#[deleted]#Yea mine are sort of sideways and way at the back. Only recently discovered there are special toothbrushes for these with small little heads.#Cheers buddy#Do you honestly believe we will ever see $1 VET and if so, what timeline?#\> If something big is really brewing and insiders know that, you’ll see it in the chart.P&D also shows on the chart. P doesn't mean buy, D doesn't mean sell. Especially true of s\* coins.  That said, you make a very valid argument overall.#The Node bonus rate does not vary depending on the amount of VET you own. The rate is constant, if you increase the number of tokens you own the node bonus rate is the same it is just now multiplied by a larger supply because you hold more.The equation is (*Total Rate = Base Rate(x)+Node Bonus Rate(X)  )*Example Total Rate = .000432(X) + .00009136(X)  The base rate .000432 and Strength Node rate .00009136 stay constant no matter how many tokens you have. The only dynamic variable is X, the amount of tokens you own. The reward ratios are static.On a bigger picture the size of the pool should determine each node bonus rate and they stay fixed until the pool is reduced again. But people in general owning more coins will not reduce the pool. It is my understanding the VET in the pool is locked until the foundation decides to release it. The only way the node bonus rates go down is when the foundation decides to decrease the pool, you can buy from the pool on the open market.#It’s pretty terrible. However, you can keep it on you wallet and sell it whenever you like. Don’t have to bind it to the ledger.#If Vechain continues to operate and expand we will see 1$. Remember price of a token isn't a marketcap of a company like in classic stock market, it will be a mcap of whole ecosystem and all involved users (BYD,BMW, DHL, Walmart, San Marino so on). But as for me, this is far away from the point I'm planning to sell. I think 1$ is possible after the next bull-bear cycle, that is about 2(next bull)+5(next bear)+3(next bull) years, so about 10 years from now. Every next phase of the cycle will be longer than previous ones.When Vet hits ""new paradigm"" phase during next bull cycle, don't forget to sell, because it will go down -80-90% AGAIN, despite all the pleb narratives ""adoption has come"", ""decoupled from BTC"" which will be pushed hard AGAIN.#$1 will never be achieved. The token costs $0.003 atm. If we were to hit $0.03 it would be unbelievable. Literally unbelievable.#Opposite is true no? Pump, you should sell.Dump, you should buy.#Sorry, but you're wrong.  You really need to think about how the two-token system works.  The foundation set aside 15billion VET for a pool.  That VET pool creates VTHO just like any other VET.  The VTHO generated by that VET then needs to be distributed evenly to anyone with a node. They can't just give every node owner a fixed amount of VTHO.  What would happen if the number of node owners doubled... where would that extra VTHO come from?  Instead, every node owner's bonus VTHO would be cut in half.  Just take a look at the reward bubbles in your app.  They will vary slightly over the course of a week or two.  Why would that happen if the only variable is the size of the pool and that remains constant?#Gotta save this comment. It has so much truth to it. I definitely learned from Dec 2017 / Jan 2018 mania and will take something off the table the next time and won't let myself be rushed by the pleb euphoria again. Plus I never thought of VeChains Market Cap like that.I also pretty much agree with your timeline for the future and the current TA on VET of yours. IMO the chart looks quite good (and **very** similar to the Wall Street Cheat Sheet \[post depression, consolidating above previous support\]) + Alts have historically performed best in Winters.  Only thing I'd slightly disagree with is the length of the next bear. I'd put it closer to 4 years for Alts and max 3 for BTC.#[deleted]#Why do you say that? Is it because it's too big a gain? Or is the timeframe that you're looking at is short? I'd understand if it's the latter.What if I told you an asset grew by 120,000% (that's one hundred and twenty THOUSAND percent) and that it's not crypto. Is that believable?Well, that's exactly what you'd hv gained if you had bought Amazon at its IPO price (not even talking about its ATL when it crashed).#Keeping expectations low. I like it. But a 10x to 0.03 isn't abnormal in crypto at all.#Thats how it should be. But if P is because insiders believe there is something big in the works, they will front run others and will show on the chart. If you can differentiate between a scam PnD and insider trading, then you will benefit. For that you should be an insider lol.#>Alts have historically performed best in WintersYeah I'm waiting for that Jan-Feb#Because I've bought so much of this shit that $0.03 per token would mean that I could retire. And things like that dont happen to me.#Follow the smart money#All I know is that tokens locked up in economic nodes and x nodes has been increasing as far back as the [charts](https://vechainstats.com/charts/) go.  That's either smart money or throwing good money after bad.  How can you tell the difference?  That's the million dollar question.#X nodes overall holdings haven’t changed since ages and are floating around 21-23bn mark since I can recall, when X node tokens were introduced#I was just looking at the last three months that were available on the chart.  It would be awesome if someone had more historical data, but I'll just look at what I've found.&#x200B Econ nodes have gone from locking up 9.45b VET to 10.b VET, which is a 5.5% increase over three months.  &#x200B X Node holdings have gone from 21.89b VET to 22b VET, which isn't a huge jump.  But we've also gone from 4,613 x node tokens to 4,550 x node tokens in that same three month window.  So, we've increased locked up tokens by 0.5%, while losing 1.3% of the nodes.  Put another way, we've gone from an average stack size of 4.75million VET to 4.83million VET... or a 1.7% increase.  I'd say that these numbers indicate that node holders are, on average, accumulating."

Our copyright dapp STAMP is getting final touches. The first 3 dapps to use the VRA API have been sealed. The first auction is arranged. Over 10,000 pieces of art/characters/dapp items are waiting. This week it's showtime!  #TimeToRollOutTheBeast  https://twitter.com/veriartivra/status/1185984278594752514?s=20#Seems like I chose the perfect day to take some time off, expecting a typical slow Sunday regarding our beloved magic internet money. But it appears there was some action today.Never change, crypto. Never change.#Out of curiousity, does anyone know how much maintaining VeChainStats cost per month ? I mean, that website is much more insightful than Veforge and I don't see Fabian begging for money ?#https://twitter.com/sunshinelu24/status/1185958456932610049?s=201) No doubt, Mass adoption is the way to go and it cannot be done without enterprise level applications which require professional tools and services to support for business continuity as one of top priorities.2) Community involvement and contribution to ecosystem with business value is still long way to go with professionalism. It’s a must to have in-house built infrastructure support in short term.3) From long term view, both are really needed to have professional enterprise teams to join community and community startups to be more and more professional even from the very beginning. Won’t stop until the day comes.#The knee-jerk reaction of everyone who is screaming for the foundation to pay Totient and not let this happen is missing a couple major points. 1) Vechain has already supported Totient, so the complaints are disingenuous from the start. Whether it's ""enough"" is a different discussion. 2) A good company is not held hostage by a volunteer developing team like this. Some of you sound like you *want* the company you are invested in to bow to this type of pressure....not prudent. 3) If the foundation did bow to this and begin financially supporting Totient, they would need to get the funding from somewhere. So, you *want* more sell walls?4) All of this may simply be a purposeful and prudent consolidation of Vechain's marketing efforts. It makes a ton of sense that major features would eventually be in-house.Edit: Announcement from Vechain came maybe 10 minutes after this post. I am very pleased with how they handled this situation, per the above. Totient Labs is unprofessional and behaved essentially like children here.#There is alot of people worrying about their holdings disappearing with totient closing down. Shows that there is still alot of misunderstanding within this space still.#i can only imagine the resources needed to update circulating supply on explore#https://twitter.com/vechainofficial/status/1185895864012664833?s=21New wallet and ledger sync.  Take a deep breath.#New Transaction Record  VIP191 :)#I for one am sad to see Toitent go. I've worked in the start up space for many years and there are many things that need to go right in order for a start up to succeed. Pivoting sometimes is key.100k is nothing in the application development world. Especially in SF, where development is more expensive. For a little perspective the development agency I worked for would charge $175 an hour. I could see the explorer taking around 3 months to build. 3 months is roughly 13 weeks which is about 520 hours. 520 x 175 is $91,000. Some places charge per hour per developer. All that to say, development isn't cheap.Maybe Toitent had a plan but the plan didn't work out. Maybe they didn't have at all and were hoping VeChains performance was a bit better. Who knows.Toitent has helped this ecosystem a lot. I wish they were sticking around but they gotta do what they gotta do. I wish them the best!Also I'd love to work on an open source explorer if anyone is interested. 😉#Totient : we want more moneyVechain : noTotient : we'll shut it downVechain : fine we have our ownhttps://medium.com/@vechainofficial/announcing-the-new-official-vechain-block-explorer-and-vechain-sync-ledger-wallet-interface-38a4b5360aeb#[deleted]#Quick question. We will HAVE to download and install a new desktop wallet (Synch) , in order to have access via our ledger, right? There will be no other way to access the Ledger wallet other than this, correct?

I understand they've put in some efforts, delivering for the Vechain community. Never the less, Vechain rewarded them accordingly. I really believe they have pulled the short string in this game. I dont think they saw the full futuristic possabilities, maintaining a long sustainable partnership with Vechain.

Consulting? What would they consult on? Onloading to the platform or developing solutions on VeChain? Maybe there was not enough business from that end yet and they needed more runway. I'd imagine they would look for more runway or being brought in as 1st party, neither of which happened. It would seem VeChain would not want to 'recreate the wheel' and build on Totient's explorer, but the cost of bringing Totient in-house was too high.#I have all my VET stored on a nano s ledger.

[https://imgur.com/a/i0bEQkV](https://imgur.com/a/i0bEQkV)Due to lack of interest and support is basically all they say.  Now I understand why we started seeing some ads on VeForge a month or two ago. Trying to generate some revenue I would assume.#I still have access to Veforge Explorer via iPhone, anyone else? [https://imgur.com/a/XycA9s3](https://imgur.com/a/XycA9s3)#It is probably unsustainable to run a shop in San Francisco for Totient. Rent $7k/month. Servers maybe $500/month (heroku ain't cheap). Cost for devs $10,000/month at a minimum.  Run it for 6 months and with no revenue stream it is unsustainable. Maybe what led to the decision to pull out. They probably want to go  the VC route that can get them a few million to keep their lights on.Edit: Question is - out of the $500 million ecosystem fund, couldn't a couple of million be given to Totient for the great work they've put in so they could keep their lights on and continue the good work? Maybe the bear had the $500 million fund for breakfast.#[deleted]#Does any one know If i have my VET on my VeChain Thor iOS app. Am I okay?Do I need to do something?#[deleted]#[deleted]#Say something I'm giving up on you....#[deleted]#Apparently the vechain foundation had a mack kn intrest in totient.

Afaik VeForge was launched 10 days after mainnet so 3 months for an explorer is a bit of a stretch (it was easier than bc chain was empty). But all that is besides the point as they weren't employed by vechain and were doing a community project. They did a great job but the way they've communicated their leaving of this project is amateurish at best.#Amen. Many seem to be vitriolic about them departing the ecosystem, this is sad given all they have done. I'm not blaming the Vechain Foundation, I just wish it had worked out differently.#Your math and most of your info are wrong. You can build explorer in few days with only few hours of active work and I think $175 for an hour of work is crazy overpriced so after they have received at least $100K for probably few days of active work, this is in my eyes simple greed and disrespect since $100/month would be more than enough to cover server costs but still they decided to shut it down.#Shame if it came down to demanding more money.#I just started tracking mainnet and testnet transactions and clauses a week ago on a spreadsheet. Maybe the new one will go back more than a month but idk#Yes - but in fairness to sync, its quite useful if you use dApps. I totally understand your position though#The private keys and address are stored on your ledger, veforge is simply a means to interact with the blockchain. Your tokens are no way at threat from this#Hi there!Good question, and we get it a lot. and as you're working on a thesis I'll give you a detailed response. I'm not sure what your project entails whether its IP rights or NFTs so I can't answer for your topic specifically but I can tell you about VeriArti of course. First you have to realise that VeriArti is merely utilising the two main benefits of blockchain technology: immutability and verification. These allow us to provide an environment for digital art to be unique which means collectibles, game items, cards, items are true to their word when they say they are one of kind. Now, as with any public blockchain, we or anyone, cannot stop people writing any data they want to it, illegal or copyrighted. In fact, nothing is stopping someone working on a smart contract, minting someone else's work on VeChain and selling it outside of VeriArti. That's just the reality of bad actors and the human element needed to write the blockchain. In effect it's up to the buyer to deem whether they think a game character or digital art collectible is authentic, as a takedown will affect their money spent. We of course have a legal disclaimer which waives us of any responsiblity however while other protocols just deem this to be enough (won't mention names...oh ok: enjin, opensea, redbubble nearly any other NFT sites), we do go much further in order not only provide an easy access environment to these tools, but a safe space in order to handle bad actors. We do this in three ways (ranked from low to high in efficiency) in deterring people minting and selling other people's work:1) Community report - each NFT has a report option and comments section. It wouldn't be too long before someone or the owner realised this wasn't the artist's work and a takedown would ensue. You also have to expect that an author will most likely publicise their work publically, and if there is none of that, it may be the first of many red flags. 2) KYC/Verified Artists - We offer professional artist accounts to those who are willing to KYC and to artists by invite only (more well-known ones, a good example of which will be announced soon). This of course is not only rendering the author liable publically, but it instills trust into a buyer. There are also many dapps and games that are free to use the VRA minting service, so if they use copyrighted material, well their dapp will fail. 3) STAMP - This really is our groundbreaking product and was developed for questions like these. STAMP takes advantage of the immutbality and validity of the blocckahin by allowing authors to encrypt and register thei work as proof-of-authority at any stage of developemtn from any app. So you can imagine an author who has STAMPS for the progress of their work is much more likely to not only win a copright case (its main function) but also deem trust in buyers.&#x200B In fact, if a piece of art has been KYCd by an author and STAMPed, both a 'verified author' and the STAMP icon will show on that NFT. So, if you see a piece of work that has no verified author, no stamp, no public marketing, and is for sale for $3k, you can imagine it won't be sold.Feel free to shoot me back any more questions to clarify!#I believe the eimajine answered this question not too long ago#https://vechainstats.com/charts/https://insight.vecha.in/#/#Check pinned post on the main feed.#[removed]#I bet they under promise and over deliver.#They should have found a way to monetize cometverse or give comets a purpose thru a game/social platform.

Unfortunately it seems they squandered that opportunity to build a legitimate business and instead looked for the foundation for continuous handouts.#Correct#I just keep mine on the VeChainThor App. Pretty sure it is safe there too.#They are hunting you#It's scheduled maintenance, they just started the maintenance a bit earlier than first communicated.#Why would they just toss them a couple million when Vechain can make it just as well as them for a fraction the price?That is not how a business operates. Vechain is in the profit making business - not sympathy business.#The $500M is investor money so I doubt the last point because I doubt it was in crypto form. VeChain can’t be expected to support every business that operates on the network. They did some awesome stuff no doubt, they also won a lot of cash only in April ($100K) how is that all gone in just 6 months? Doesn’t seem like they were operating their business very well, or perhaps it simply wasn’t profitable. That’s a shame, but you can’t prop up zombie companies in that scenario. If they’re bleeding cash, unfortunately they ain’t gonna last. In any case, this new explorer sounds far more feature rich (AN info!!) and functionality can’t be cut off out of the blue and even before the stated deadline! What a joke on Totient’s behalf. Super unprofessional business behaviour.#why would they give a couple of million to them? and how would they justify this to their internal devs? they did a great job but they also got compensated with tokens and great exposure. a forked metamask is a forked metamask, sucks if your operations cost are bigger than of your non SF based counterparts. giving couple of million to them would be irresponsible.#[deleted]#I say fk 'em#No, you’re fine.#You're absolutely fine.

Let's hope we keep our community whole this time around. :)#Yep. It's a worry.#For me the biggest worry was that all the sudden the viewer is just gone. Will the new one be here in two weeks really? Obliviously I trust the foundation to keep there word and come through with this. I put all of my assets on a Ledger for security, the problem is now they are so secure I cant even access them. The middle link (viewer) between the hardware wallet and the blockchain no longer exists. Its just a weird feeling to have your hands tied for two weeks hoping for a new solution.  I guess the real positive here is that when the new viewer is here it should be here for good since it will be run by the foundation. No more third party viewer that can have the plug pulled in 24hrs notice. I would think, if the new one suddenly goes offline in the future it basically means the entire foundation went under.#Are they really departing, or just stopping a few of their services?#> You can build explorer in few days with only few hours of active workWhile you can probably build a very minimal explorer in a few days with only a few hours of work, VeForge's explorer was much much more sophisticated. From what I could gather VeForge used React, React-Router, LocalStorage, and a backend component.For context I built VeChain's Summit website in a couple weeks. That was a one page dApp.> I think $175 for an hour of work is crazy overpricedWe actually were priced pretty well compared to our competition. Here is more info on Development Agency pricing:https://www.beaconmm.com/2018/07/12/how-much-does-cost-hire-agency/https://www.fullstacklabs.co/blog/2019-software-development-price-guide-and-hourly-rate-comparison> they have received at least $100K for probably few days of active workThis was prize money for winning a bounty/hackathon which was based on impact not development time. > $100/month would be more than enough to cover serverVeChain stats is more server cost then that#When is it never about more money?#I think this could actually be a great thing for giving dApps more visibility. Who else knows you can play Tetris and store your scores on VeChainThor? Probably not that many. You can via Sync!#Yea so you can guarantee that the wallet address is tied to the ledger no matter what. This mean the ledger opens the stored wallet address not matter what the viewer is ( VeForge, or the New VeChain one coming) I guess the only real downside and I will not be able to deposit or withdraw from the address until the new gateway or explorer is launched from VeChain.#[deleted]#Thanks so much for your detailed answer.

Thanks#“We are currently undergoing unscheduled maintenance”#$100K in SF is chump change. Nobody can run household with that money let alone a company. Plus think about how many times over VIP-191 will pay back if VeChain takes off.#\> why would they give a couple of million to themFor the innovation they are bringing. The much talked about fee delegation wouldn't have taken its final shape without Totient. You need such innovative thinkers to advance the products and make it ready for mass adoption. Low cost development is no substitute for innovation.#Oops I thought those are from same team. Nvm then#Lol relax...#Thx! What is this wallet thing talking about then that’s changing?#Ah okay.

Obviously angered by Vechain response they are not waiting until 2moro as previously stated.#By all means move them to the wallet if you wish to have the peace of mind, but both private keys and public keys are stored on the ledger, nothing to do with VeForge at all. Your private key is how you access your funds, as long as you have the ledger you will be fine when VeChain provides ledger functionality (very soon according to their post).#They were never transported to VeForge or over or under or any combination of the above on VeForge. They were moved to an address on the VeChainThor blockchain. VeForge is merely a window to glimpse upon the blockchain. It’s shutting down has zero impact on functionality (other than ledger access) but another will be built imminently by the foundation so not to worry. The only thing you need to worry about is keeping the private key safe (which is on your ledger).#I see now, but they already mentioned that they were going to do maintenance today on the 18th of October. As I mentioned, the maintenance started a bit earlier due to ‘an unexpected upgrade from Google’.#That’s a true point and I don’t mean to slander the work they did.. VIP-191 is genius#Read the part about VIP-191 carefully in the new Medium post. Totient helped with VIP-191, but didn't do it all by themselves. It's on them if they can't find another way to make money than by asking VeChain for donations. Just sad to see them end the explorer all of a sudden.#[removed]#SF is not exactly in the forefront of blockchain innovation and just bc it is one of the most expensive cities to run a company in it doesn't make all other locations low cost. I do agree with you that they should be compensated i just think that couple of million is a bit too much.#Veforge is shutting down so people with ledgers will temporarily lose access. But if you have yours on the mobile wallet, it’s nothing to worry about. Ledger users will get a new access point in 2 weeks. In the meanwhile, you should download VeChain Sync so you can access the new blockchain explorer VeChain is building.

Is their burn separate?#It‘s fantastic. The price stays low and I can still accumulate super cheap for some time. I can‘t believe how lucky I am. (disclaimer: no irony)#I am not spreading FUD. This is complicated stuff and I have a question regarding tokenomics. I know this has been discussed at length multiple times so I’m sorry... Say for example Business A buys 100VET now. They will produce a specific amount of VTHO that will be used to power 10 transactions a day (for example). When demand for VTHO increases, the price increases and the foundation increases the generation rate of VTHO to stabilize price. Say they double it. That same 100VET produces the  VTHO that can still power those same 10 transactions. Even though the amount of VTHO has increased, the value to the business is still the same and costs the same amount of fiat. VET increased 10x. Now Business B wants to own VET, and they buy 100VET. They will be paying a 10x multiple of what Business A paid, but will still end up producing the same amount of value for powering transactions as Business A. My question is, why pay that 10x multiple and purchase VET to earn VTHO. Does it not becomes less and less appealing to buy VET as VET price increases? Say, for example, VET 100x. Are businesses going to buy this expensive token to generate VTHO, or purchase the VTHO that’s doubled in cost rather than 100xVET?#LOUIS VUITTON might be a much bigger deal than previously thought.#Posting this comment seperately to get some good discussion going. This place has been somewhat dead recently. In response to Paul H. Ponytail and the discussion he started. There most certainly is a right and wrong in politics. Innocent human death is wrong. Plain and simple. We should be past that, and yet we're still killing each other every fucking day for stupid fucking shit. Oh, your opinion on what happens after we die is different than mine? Well I have a gun so I'ma fucking kill you.And its a fact that certain political structures allow this to go on way easier than others. There are things in politics that are right and wrong. Things that cause damage and things that don't. There's a reason that quality of life varies around the world and in different countries and its 100% because of politics. Some countries have legalized drugs and view addiction as a mental health problem rather than a crime, and there's other countries that throw junkies in prison for 30 years. Some countries prison systems are designed to help and rehibilitate the prisoners and others abuse and torture them.Crypto can do A LOT of good for a lot of these political issues. And there's only 1 way to think about and design solutions for the world's problems and that is to talk about them and educate people about them. It's not opinion. There is right and wrong. And human rights are at basis of what is right.As pioneers in the crypto revolution-to-be(hopefully) I think we are all here for 2 things, to make money, and to make the world a better place. Why do we like Vechain? Why is traceability important? Why do we want corporations to implement traceability solutions? Why do we want to know where our food comes from? It's to protect ourselves from individuals that put personal gain over the welfare of others. Greed and corruption is the reason there is so much illegitmacy in the origin of our products. Whether food, beverage, clothing, etc, if there is a way to cut costs and sell a shit tier product and make more money, ignorant uneducated individuals will take that oppurtunity.Tell me policy has no effect on how goods are produced. You CANNOT seperate politics from anything. It's why Vechain exists and its the source of the problem that Vechain is trying to fix. Laws make it easier/harder to throw welfare under the bus for profit.Rotten on Netflix is a really good doc-series that outlines some of the fucked up shit happening with our food. Tell me politics has nothing to do with it. I dare you.#Great. Now I want their names, addresses, political affiliations, and favorite colors!

However, the dump to Binance is a bad look.

Noice.#We shouldn't expect a blockchain company to receive the cryptoyuan in my opinion. I've spent time researching this, and it's very probable that the only non-bank company that will receive the cryptoyuan will be Oneconnect, a venture of Ping An Insurance. It will be introduced in NYSE in an IPO mid-november.So most probably neither Vechain or Neo will be involved. But there's plenty of fish in China and in the world anyway !#Seems like a shift indeed!#The last two days it sure seems that is what is happening. Unless the MPP platform is being updated and is offline or something. The VIP191 have been steady growing for last 2-3 weeks but it wasn't until yesterday we saw a sharp decline in MPP. Not sure what is going on yet. 10/15 was one of the best days we have had in a while.  74,000 MPP 63,000 VIP191 that is about 140,000 total. If we start to see 0 MPP and 120-150,000 VIP191 next week, to me that would strengthen the thought they moved to VIP191#bought  trx at 0.01$ and sold it at +-0.16$ few days after january 2018... 1600% gains. then moved it all in vechain. i want a medal as well, lol.#You wont get a medal now, but in 5+ years you might be seen as a little Warren Buffet.#Some others in the same boat it seems.

The security and trust of the system will be weakend by such a decision.  But such a decision is political, no? My point is that sometimes there is most definitely a right and wrong.  And when the wrong decision appears about to be made or has been made it most definitely should be discussed.  Because when such wrong decisions are made it is generally because of either ignorance or hidden motives.  And you don't figure out which it is without discussion.#1,000,000 SHA \* (0.0004116 USD / 1 SHA) = **411.6 USD**#I know it's not helpful but it's around 115k VET ATM I think for 1 million SHA (lowest node)#About 350 usd#I'm a believer.#many greets back, and oh, can you say ""fuck you"" to kim for me plz :)#Binance walls are still as strong as ever.#Seemingly the end of October or so, they are coming back with a few more lines I read. So once they snort them I guess we will be rockin '. And remember 100 lines by the end of the year. What a party that's gonna be...#I’ve been using doge faucets and the parity of doge to vet is almost 1:1. I’m really excited about that lol#It is all the same.  You have blocksThen inside the each block can be one or multiple transactions. (Some blocks have 0 transactions)Inside each transaction is multiple clauses. I think 40 is generally the max amount of clauses per Transaction. I did see some of 80 or 100 a long time ago. The MPP and VIP191 are just different types of clauses. They allow different people to pay the VTHO for the clause basically.  You can also see a count of clauses associated with VET and VTHO transfers. Every clause requires some VTHO (gas) to move. The total burn is associated with all of the clauses, which is the main thing I focus on. You can watch the number of transactions but its a different tier. The most important value to me is the number of individual clauses.#If you want to post transactions on the bockchain you need VTHO. IF you are a big business you spend one large lump sum to buy VET and generate VTHO for free. One big upfront cost and the thing takes care of its self. The cheaper the VET price the smaller your upfront cost... Yeah Some businesses could win big by buying in early. Others will still buy in later down the road just not as good of a deal. Eventually, the demand for VTHO is large and steady because the blockchain is so active. To get this VTHO either you own VET and generate it or you **buy it from someone who owns VET and generated it**. Its thats simple. You can not purchase VTHO out of the thin air. It is all tied to a VET token somewhere. Years and Years from now I could still be selling my generated VTHO off to business that need it. I wouldn't be surprised if this thing takes off and those big businesses start grabbing up VET for this reason. Imagine Walmart buying enough VET to generate VTHO that they sell or give off to there suppliers who need it.  VET could be scarce someday and VTHO will still be in demand. You win either way if you are here early enough. Either I sell my VTHO to the future business or the future business buy up all the VET which helps drives the price of VET up.  Most likely both of these happen at the same time.#If I understand correctly, you are making a wrong assumption at the start. If business A buys 100 VET, which generates VTHO for 10 transactions (say 10 VTHO generated per day, 1 VTHO per transaction) And you state that the value of VTHO increases, so to stabilize the price again, the foundation increases VTHO generation per VET. Business A still has 100 VET, but instead of producing 10 VTHO per day, it now produces 20 VTHO per day. The increased supply of VTHO brings the USD price back down to the initial price. The goal is (if I am correct) to keep transaction price stable. So if the value of VTHO has returned to it's initial value, the transaction price will still be 1 VTHO. So this company can now power 20 transactions per day instead of the initial 10Edit: in my opinion, VET price will be driven by mainnet usage and so by VTHO burn rate. VTHO burn rate increases -> more demand for VTHO -> VTHO price increase -> VET price increase. As soon as the VTHO burn rate exceeds the daily generation rate for a long time or by a massive amount, something has to be changed. Most likely this will be the VTHO cost per transaction, as if I understood correctly, changing the generation rate would require a fork. Final thoughts  Buying VET will be more expensive for a company, but if the mainnet takes of it will be an appreciating asset which also (partly) funds your own operations. Buying VTHO only funds your operations but will not appreciate in value as you will most likely burn all VTHO that you buy. For us investors it should not matter too much, if everyone only buys VTHO, the price of VTHO will increase so much that the ROI of VET becomes insane, so people want to buy VET as well.#If the generation rate doubles then the amount of transactions you can execute with that 100 VET doubles. You could sell half of your VET for a profit and still have enough left over for your 10 transactions per day. If a similar business wanted to join after the generation rate doubled, they would only have to buy 50 VET instead of 100 VET.Theoretically the price of 50 VET after a doubling in the generation rate should equal the price of 100 VET before the generation rate increase. Therefore the cost to businesses does not change regardless of the generation rate.#Huh? The cost of the transaction doesn't just magically increase. That is Bitcoin, where the fees go way up. Jebus. If the value of my dollar increases, I get to buy more goods and services. The same goes for Vet and Thor. How did you come up with you just get the same for your thor if it's value and bargaining power goes up? If the Value of the USD goes up, it may take more of one currency to buy more USD. The same can be said for thor, it's value, and what it could do.. So if thor goes up to $1.00.. around the world.. This is hypothetical.. And the USD inflates and becomes less valuable..Conclusion? I will buy more shit with my thor and receive nice discounts because.. like you said.. who is gonna buy the vet if they don't wanna? Think different. I don't have to go buy my pennies. Or my dollars. Unless I was buying gold dollars for free frenquent flyer miles, and just depositing them back in to my bank account. Rinse, repeat.Later, I will just fly for cheaper using thor.. You know, in case said airline company doesn't wanna pay for 100 vet to use vechain for tracking and or other servicesGranted, much like the information super highway, one may have to pay more to keep up with upgrading the network, but that may rarely have an effect on transaction cost. I would think it would take a considerable amount of growth for that to occur.. Vechain would have to uproot our way of doing business and soar to over a $1 before we would see this happen.. Does anyone know how expensive maintaining a blockchain network can be? Employees, electricity, storage, etc?#>foundation increases the generation rate of VTHO to stabilize price. Say they double it. That same 100VET produces the VTHO that can still power those same 10 transactions.Already wrong at this point. Example, 100VET produced 100 VTHO. 1 TX burns 10 VTHO. Total 10 tx could be done (in a time period)Now, gen rate doubled. 100VET produces 200VTHO. 1TX still burns 10 VTHO. Total 20tx can be done now. Value of VET increased.First grade math literally.#This profile 'Crypto_maniac5' has a specific and welltought way of spreading Fud.

If you want a quick and informed catch-up [here](https://vechain101.com/) is a good place to start.#and the more people that use oceanex ex the larger the next burn will be!#For sure, we get ours from a local shop (not a big company) becuase they source their vapes locally so we trust it more. This would be great for this space. Hopefully there are companies that jump on this train. Hopefully they're going to conferences and have networking with companies in this space. I just hope it isn't waiting for the companies to come to them.#This is something I was wondering about too. I live in China, and I use WeChat pay for absolutely everything. I can't see the point of adding a ""digital yuan"", when WeChat does the job easily already. The only reason I can think of is that they want to make it easier to send money abroad. But even then, everyone knows that the government doesn't want their currency leaving the country. So who knows#Why? This still has nothing to do with Vechain#I personally think the pony tail party has a much greater chance of getting into office than the manbun party#That's specific to VeChain though, which isn't what I was referring to#That has nothing to do with politics. Relationships between countries, policy-making is what is meant by politics.So yes, the issues you raised can be discussed freely.#🤝#Thanks :h#One of the only times ""tree fiddy"" was correct#Thank you#No politics man#And I think we just kinda follow binances price right? Aren't there bots that keep the price pretty similar because they trade back and forth and make money off of the spread? I guess if Binance is the daddy I'll look there from now on. That sucks. I actually shouldn't keep staring at the price because I'm done buying but it's too addicting.#Took a re-read to realise this wasnt a typo. Hopefully we will get a nice bump, in transactions :)#So you are pinning your hopes on what some random dude said on WeChat. Surely the information source must be trustworthy by reddit standards.#Ah ok thank you. You know what it's like...your always looking for more (VTHO) burn.#Thanks for that response. So changing the generation rate of VTHO has nothing to do with the cost of transactions?#Whoops lol thanks#Condescension not necessary, relax.#This is not true. You can’t say anything critical, it seems. Is this not a good question? I’m curious about it and maybe others are as well#Well the question he asks is a pretty good one. Might as well answer it and get a discussion going among the rest, might be useful information for people looking into VET. Comments like yours don't really add much either tbh#Cool.

How about scale of 1-10? 1 is bad 10 is amazing. Like a 6 maybe?#Who knows, right?#If you read carefully it is the exact same as the current american political situation.   A fucking moron is making decisions that go against all advice and history.    And it is wrong.  And everybody is telling him its wrong.  And he does it anyway.   And an argument can be made it is out of ignorance which is still wrong, but also easy to ascribe to a leader's prerogative.    Avoiding discussion about it has allowed the appearance of it being ignorance to remain.     Unfortunately, we are now finding out that it is definitely not ignorance but rather a bed of hidden motives of personal profit and asset protection that the president has sold out America and its allies on.     And we most definitely should discuss it all because how is solid crypto policy going to get created in such an environment?    Quite frankly, we need to be discussing who the next president is going to be and what their views on crypto are.  &#x200B And if all of that is not what you are talking about either... well then I will shut up now but I think my points are still valid about political discussion of all kinds.  Its one thing to discuss an opinion on a topic.  It is another to discuss right and wrong.#It was an analogy for what's going on now with American politics.#I think binance price is mostly legit.Alot of people think oceanex does massive wash trading. I'm not sure, but it does seem odd many sells go thru at prices that aren't on the order book. Then when you put in and actual order things change instantly.I don't buy and sell enough to really know, but I get a feeling it is wash trading. Binance probably does some too.Everything in crypto is dodgy or crooked really.# Hi done, I'm Dad!#Well, if memory serves, there were a few confirmations.#Correct, changing VTHO generation rate will only result in each VET generating more VTHO. So if transaction costs remains equal, you can power more transactions with the same amount of VET. But as I said, I believe changing generation rate is not that easy. Changing basic transaction costs is easier, which will have the same effect, as you will be able to power more transactions with the same amount of VET#It could.. That might be too open ended.Lu has stated that this would be closer to a last resort type thing, which leads me to believe cost wise, they already have a good idea of what fees will be to maintain the vechain network as the business grows and thor flows. I am sure one day, if they succeed, that there is the likely possibility that fees would go up.. what would change this? Things like trade wars, maybe. How successful other companies that work alongside vet and thor... say something like xrp or whatever else.. how china handles a stable currency? And, of course, fees associated with maintaining growth. Probably most of the same crap that effects our fees today, but in a brand new environment. For now, I would hope they would remain stable until this thing takes off, if ever..#But I'm flabbergasted.#Don't listen to the squeaky wheels, it's a fine question and if vechain can't stand up to scrutiny then I certainly wouldn't want any VET.#It's not a good question, he's got a math error in his very first sentence. He is either a troll, or a very stupid person, or both. In either case, we won't lose our time with him.#I mean...multiple times throughout today's daily people have requested for there not to be a political discussion in the Vechain daily.. the mod even locked some of those threads ... were you ignorant to that or just not care before writing that book#Skipping the first six paragraphs would have conveyed your point far more concisely.#Check out the VeChain foundation Medium account. Lots of excellent info there, and you can make your own judgement 😊#8.8#You should turn off Rachel Maddow now...it's bad for you.#Edit: posted as it's own comment because I feel strongly about this.#The confirmations are retweets of the same WeChat from the likes of WaZa.#That isn't scrutiny. Wait until Vechain actually does something. Most humans don't know anything yet. There might be what? 100 of us here? How can scrutiny even exist? Vechain is too busy hustling like pirates of silicon valley. Most humans should know that when the value of a bargaining chip goes uo, you get more out of it. This is basic human intellect. No offense. It is also the reason many with sense might even question it's authenticity.#Yeah scrutiny by someone who can't do a basic multiplication. lol#Really needs explanation why 2x2 doesn't equal 2?  This isn't ""complicated stuff""#I’m not a troll or am I stupid... just made an error#Of course, great comment. Let's ask Reddit to require an IQ test before you are allowed to post instead of karma, so we get all the retards out of our subreddit... Get of your high horse and help people out if you are such a smart guy, at this point you are the idiot. You condescending prick#What I'm saying is regardless of what those people said, we are dealing with something that BY NATURE is political. Not talking about politics when we talk about blockchain is impossible.What's political? If we start talking about laws regarding securities or some other laws regarding blockchain tech, is that political? What about the parties making those laws or cthe countries those laws are being implemented in? Is that politics? Censoring any discussion is bullshit because it IS relevant. We're just scared because the whole hong Kong shit and we realllly want to suck the warm teet of China with this investment of ours.#Yeah. But what's done is done. If you'd like I can go back and erase it. Just because something can be simplified doesn't always mean it has to be. You're here on the daily to read people's opinions and keep up with news. I was just giving my opinion. You have no obligation to read or reply. This interests me so I gave my 2 cents. If there's anyone else interested, they can reply. If not, down vote and move along.#I dont get any of my news from the TV.   You probably shouldnt either."

Since they are in most the times just based on TA and historical Data i just got really sceptical about them.... What i learned in this VeChain Community is, that something has to bring value for the token Prize and that we can determine, at what usage, we bring ""more"" value on the table!I hear no one talking about real Usage of the coins or facts about the Usage or atleast they never try to explain on this level. So why is that? And even if they just want a ""higher price"" for a coin? What sense does this make anyway, if you just hold for more money and not for using the tech!

I can't believe that after 2 years of price being pummeled week after week after week... I'm still as excited - if not more - than I was in 2017.

IF they realize that the technology is worth it for the long term and they want to actually invest into trying to get into crypto and pay for their own transactions then they can go ahead and drop the money, set up the wallets, buy the VET. The good thing is they have choices here.#If they wish to sponsor transactions, for example. A company who wants their user base to use their dApp would likely need to sponsor transactions and so hold VET, or pay someone else to sponsor them via VIP-191. In the case of the latter, there would be an extra cost, so it would make more sense to just produce your own, especially if operating at scale. Plus, in the future, VET is intended to serve as the smart currency for the ecosystem to settle smart contracts and business activities, so it would become necessary to hold it to allow a company to transact with it.#Is no one mentioning that your math is greatly off here? One transaction costs about 0.0082$ - so far so good. But 165$ / 0.0082 = about 20.000 transactions... How did you get to 400k? Also you gotta remember that 21 VTHO is only for moving around VET. If you are writing data to the blockchain, the average transaction cost is about 48 VTHO (Source: VeChainStats). This means almost 0.02$ per tx.(If we spin this further this means \~111k VET for one data transaction = \~365$ = \~19.000 (data) transactions.)&#x200B Or am I completely in the dark? Please check my math guys :)#It's set up this way purposefully. The companies that are Authority Node holders are most likely going to do lots of transactions on chain. So they have massive holding which will, and has been, generating large amounts of Vtho.Companies that do not want to invest in VET the same way have the option of purchasing Vtho on the open, or private, market. The only question for investing vs open market purchase is the long term cost for the company. I like the set up, and VeChain did a great job thinking it through before implementing. It's going to be great as it grows.#If it's cheaper to buy VTHO directly in order to do 400,000 transactions, then let them spend their $165 on VTHO.  I, personally, have no need to do 400,000 transactions, so VTHO doesn't have much inherent value to me.  So I'll spend my $165 on VET and they can spend their $165 on VTHO and it's a win/win, since they've gotta buy their VTHO from people like me.#At some point, someone has to produce the VTHO that gets burned.It doesn't matter if it's produced by companies or not.And the only way to produce VTHO is by having VET on a wallet...#20 million for the rest of the year. As far as I know that's all we know. Could spend 20 million in 1 day 9 months from now or split it up amongst the months. No one knows. We'll just have to watch the wallet and for the love of God please keep all speculation at 0.#Which medium are you using to access vexchange? Comet, mobile app, Arkane?#[deleted]#Is this real volume?

When was VEN created?#I'm not saying price won't increase(we're all in it to make money,so I hope so too) , but the return from vet  will stay about the same since the generation rate won't change since vtho and vet will grow in parallel.(im not talking about the token appreciation, just from a VTHO need point of view) You're talking about investors, im just talking about companies who simply want their products tracked#So they can't sponsor them without holding VET? If a Dapp needs like 1000 transaction/day they would need 165 000 $ worth of VET at today's price??#Yes, good catch. I was also wondering about the VTHO/Tx for writing to the blockchain as I've seen the 21 and 48 VTHO numbers. I wasn't sure which applies. Been running some numbers for this so thanks for helping fix that.The 111k VET for one data transaction comes from 48/.000432, yes? That's a good baseline to have.For big companies, I was estimating closer to .0007 generation rate based on node status and potential changes to node pools. I tried to copy and paste from a spreadsheet earlier but the post wouldn't go through.But here's one example from what I've looked at today. I wanted to see how things work out because this is one of the main factors we see brought up and it is a valid point.&#x200B **Scenario 1:**Company A buys VTHO and Company B buys VET. They want to run 10,000 Tx/day.48 VTHO/Tx, Approx. VTHO cost .0004, cost per Tx = .0192 (close enough to .02)est. generation rate .0007 VTHO/VET per day (around a Mjolnir node).VET price of $.0035Transaction $ cost is stable and company A pays the same $ for # transactions in each scenario.Company A - spends $192 /day and $70,080 per year on VTHO.Company B - buys 685,714,286 VET for $2.4M to generate the necessary 480,000 VTHO/day.Years to breakeven = 34.25 years.&#x200B **Scenario 2:**If VTHO/Tx goes to 20, Company B needs 285,714,286 VET for $1M and generates 200,000 VTHO/day.Then it takes 14.27 years to break-even.You could also assume VET price will more than double since VTHO is twice as useful/valuable.&#x200B **Scenario 3:**If VTHO/Tx goes to 5, Company B needs 71,428,571 VET at $250,000 to generate 50,000 VTHO/day.It would take 3.57 years to breakeven and VET should have increased by about 9x.&#x200B I had a better reply earlier with tables and thought-out conclusions but whatever.As you can see, after a few adjustments to the VTHO/Tx ratio, things start to look a lot better for companies holding VET rather than buying VTHO, especially once you consider possible changes to VTHO price and VET value.Of course, a company can't just buy the amount of VET needed in scenario 3 in hopes that things play out exactly like this. They would need to do a more thorough analysis, but you can see the utility of VTHO and VET grow in each scenario, which is the most important factor. Additionally, these numbers and estimates are for big companies planning to do a lot of transactions. I believe large companies are most likely to get in early due to the long-term benefits and economies of scale (as we've seen).Conclusion: we still depend on the foundation to make good decisions with the VTHO/Tx rate and any potential generation rate change. Mainly, we need them to build demand for the network, which I believe they are doing a tremendous job of and we will see considerable progress in the next year.The price... remains to be seen and depends on many factors as we’ve seen discussed here quite often.Please point out any mistakes or bad assumptions. I think it's worth looking at the numbers for smaller tx/day too, but without being able to paste the tables I don't want to list more right now.Edited: because I hadn't updated the VET value changes after adjusting VTHO/Tx.#You're right, I divided by the price of 1 VTHO, not 21.i didn't know it was 48 VTHO to write on the blockchain, i think it further my point that most of the companies who use the block chain to get their stuff tracked won't buy VET. (im talking small to medium companies, not giants)#It's $5 million per quarter.#Google chrome on desktop (macOS)#No#That is an option. On the other hand it could be a smart guy accumulating, (buying in form of an algo?)Who knows 🤔#Being our lead-investigator, can you find the Bithumb hot wallet on the blockchain?On a quick browse I came up with this address that might fit the bill, based on activity (IN-OUT txs) and age:[https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x0f53ec6bbd2b6712c07d8880e5c8f08753d0d5d5](https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x0f53ec6bbd2b6712c07d8880e5c8f08753d0d5d5)#Incorrect#So u can sleep better? I think i wouldnt sell even if it goes 3x in a week#This late? I don't think so. Never saw that before.#It depends on the timezones. Requests have been made for more EST oriented tournaments, but the team may not need to make any themselves, since soon we will be able to create our own tournaments (a key feature to the platform obviously). After this, the platform will be allowed to take off, since we will no longer be restricted to playing the scheduled beta tournaments. That is when you would want marketing.#That is true. Most games go unfilled. Most (all?) current users are US based and the scheduling of matches are inconvenient (during work hours/stupid o'clock in the morning).Edit: I should add that not many games are scheduled either.#If you have over 1M VET there is a chance.#You on xrp chat ? If not I would post your blog there#I'll let others answer cause I'm not sure. But I know you can move nodes just didn't think you could off ledger yet#Many people did..#Are you talking within the Vechain ecosystem or all of crypto? A large majority of all crypto projects have absolutely no use case. Then you have some that have a legit use case but do not need a token economy. You could eliminate 1000 of them tomorrow and nobody would give a shit outside of their bag holders. The reality is that a lot of these projects come to be because it is a way to raise money that they couldn't get starting with a traditional company structure and trying to secure a loan or getting angel investing/venture capital money. They're outsourcing the risk to the people buying the tokens.I pretty much only own BTC (believe in it as a store of value), VET, a small position in TRAC and then everything else is in Vechain ecosystem projects, mainly OCE.#VTHO price will go up because the mechanism for keeping transaction cost constant is decreasing the amount of VTHO needed per transaction.If each VTHO lets you create more transactions, VTHO is more valuable. More valuable VTHO = more valuable VET.(In theory)#The generation rate will eventually change, it will be a last resort after the Tx/VTHO ratio has been dropped several times (which only happens in a market where VTHO is continually gaining value via buy demand - AKA usage).Generation increase requires a hard fork, but with VeChain’s governance structure it won’t be much of an issue to get the all clear as it would clearly be in the blockchain’s and community’s interests.#They don’t have to hold VET, they can use MPP+VIP-191 and simply pay for the VTHO via a third party like a subscription service. I was just demonstrating a situation where they would need to hold it, as requested. There are batching technologies like MTT to help reduce VTHO costs but yes, that would be the cost to fulfil that requirement currently if you wanted to go it alone.#Brilliant answer, thank you! I'd gild you if it meant anything to me. So I guess smaller to medium companies will buy VTHO and only bigger company can afford to get the VET necessary for their tx#I agree with your calculation, with a small remark : lowering the cost in VTHO per tx actually lowers the demand for VTHO, since your VTHO can write more txs. So it should lead to price going down short term. Medium or long term though, it indeed makes the VTHO more valuable (therefore the VET too), so long term it should lead to price going up, assuming of course that in the meanwhile business grows and that the need for txs grows in proportion...It's a complicated system with at least 5 variables (price of VET, price of VTHO, VTHO cost/tx, VTHO generation rate per VET, business growth or demand), so it's not really possible to predict things...One thing is sure though : lots of txs means lots of VTHO burnt, which means lots of VTHO sold. We need a shitload of txs, and that will happen when all the big projects (carbon ecosystem, DNVGL wallets in january, BMW, Walmart etc.) get running. 2020 will be interesting.#Check it out now, it should be fixed#https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x2cf496da57192011e01448dae61895c0f4bc5d68Bithumb cold wallethttps://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x86158838e088da2a80a541fe0ec96ea4800bbc5eMost likely bithumb hot wallet#Me neither a 10x#I don't think I would be able to sleep if it goes 3x in a week.#Yeah bro I don’t I’ll ever be able to afford that lmao I’m barely making 10% but we out here w optimistic vibes!!#Change the 1M to 1B#I'm not on xrp chat#Let me ask a different way.

Although any company who can manage a Mjolnir node can make the numbers work pretty well if they are investing in the network usage long-term.#Yes, that makes sense and is a good point. Those periods before and after the rate changes will be interesting and I'm curious to see the exact mechanism they use to make these adjustments in an attempt to keep tx cost stable. Thanks for input.#Yes! It all works, thanks. What was wrong?#45 transactions total in the hot wallet. How would that work?#1M is under the chance VET gets to $.50-$1.50. Then you would have a nice NW in America. Sure, not absurdly rich, but very comfy.1B VET? If VET is even mildy successful. Or as long as it’s not a total failure you will be rich. And I mean top .1% rich.#I posted your blog there#It has been already released!#No#They are changing the wallets from time to time. Probably for security.#Shit. You've right.

Not crypto. Blockchain. They want to use it for supply chain and (food) safety. What solution does that?Let’s narrow it down. There are only 197 companies allowed to provide blockchain solutions. [List](https://coinlaw.io/china-licences-197-companies-including-tencent-alibaba-to-provide-blockchain-services/).One of them in is a blockchain committee with Tencent, Alibaba and WeChat. And that same blockchain Allready has a solution working at the governments insurance company. And it also happens to provide solutions for food safety AND supply chain! How convenient. That exact same solution happens to have partners that help and advise the Chinese government with their auditing, quality and control. If all is being add up and PBOC is releasing their blockchain solution, a stablecoin designed by their ‘settlement Division’ next month this is probably the beginning of a new era. Let me remind you.

Sunny is referring to the 13th 5-Year Plan that China are implementing. They publish this (publicly) and the technologies that are mentioned in this latest comprehensive plan from 2016 are AI and Blockchain (I haven't read it myself, but I do tend to follow Sunny closely and he has made mention to it multiple times over the last 2.5 years in interviews and AMAs).It's not a Blockchain plan specifically and there are no specific implementation timelines unfortunately. Sunnys tweet doesn't suggest he knows more detail than me or you could know, by simply reading the documents. Therefore, there is also no suggestion of involvement. Saying that, this is great news for all of us here. 1+1=2, and with all the early 2018 news of National level partnerships, the future is most definitely bright for VeChain. (I'm just waiting for Jim Breyer to next speak about Vechain. I'm betting that what he is involved in will be National level news to some extent)#2021 is only 26 paychecks away.#2021 is growth phase according to VeChain’s timeline from a presentation a good while back now. 2019/2020 were regulatory navigation. 2025 is slated as technological maturity.#>If the CEO knows details of the plan most would think he is somehow involved.I'm trying to avoid my brain tying VET to China but that's hard to ignore. That does make a pretty good case.#Yes, our fundamentals are solid.#Watch the hands, not the mouth.Big guys selling alts for btc and for usdt to buy btc with that usdt. They need btc to break ath before eoy or before halving. Then we will see new capital flow into crypto again and new pleb fomo. Temporary alts suffering is for greater good. If bitcoin won’t  break ath I don’t see 2020 as big fomo year. But if it will, the new bull market will emerge and alts will have their share of new money. All part of the plan.PS Always laughing at pleb narrative that altcoins can “decouple” from btc.#What a lucky person to have such an amount#Xi loading his bags  )#Ballers lurk amongst us#Buyback?#Another 26 million 15 min later at 42#Why does everything i read makes me take my credit card...#I guess it could be, perhaps a polite phone call beforehand would be advisable.

After all this time it's pretty clear to me they are making fair calls#Kings rule. News can be anything.#Ahhh, of all the crypto newbies I love the arrogant ones the most.#If only they would also have something like a stable coin or settlement coin. That would really have been the final piece of the puzzle :(#Since fully private blockchain is nothing more than a database, a consortium chain is probably what China will go with. Chinese banks are obviously one consortium for the Chinese issued digital currency.If, and it is a big if, public and private blockchain interaction is seen as important by the Chinese authorities as important for several activities in the economy, then VeChain stands a good chance even though there is the crypto component. Why? Because China is mostly concerned with capital flight with crypto. If MPP and VIP-191 can allow companies to pay Yuan to sponsor contracts, then the problem is solved as far capital flight with crypto is concerned. I don't know of any other Chinese blockchain that has this feature. Nearly every other blockchain provider requires transaction senders to buy tokens to transact. That is why I believe VeChain stands an excellent chance of making it big.#What delay industries ?!?!#Inject this shit straight into my veins sir#It would break us if Xi proclaimed blockchain to be a redundant technology. On the contrary this statement is very good news for Vechain and others in China. It is support for the tech, not a particular blockchain.#DNVGL work closely with the Chinese government. There’s a large leather shoed foot in that door :)#I am fully aware no one can guarantee a direct partnership between VeChain and the Chinese government.  However for the CEO of a project to tweet about this news shows he is at least very interested in it and possibly involved. The news from China is great for the entire crypto market, it could be even better for us VeChain holders in the future.Thanks for sharing your info aslo, I would agree hearing from Breyer on the topic of VeChain could be very very good for us as well.#Paychecks.....? Where we're going you won't need paychecks! :)#Yes Yes, everything is connected!!!  But seriously I thought about that as I read it. The plan is finished and developed by 2021 and massive growth until 2025 seems logical to me. Falls right in line with the timelines Sunny and the foundation have been talking about for the last year or so. Big picture is Sunny tweeting about it makes me feel like he is saying ""Oh yea I have known about this for a while and we are involved."" Rockwood also simply responded with his on tweet saying ""Blockchain not Bitcoin"" meaning the key are of focus in China is block chain technology not just Bitcoin.#https://i.imgur.com/O9OswGu.jpg2021 is the end of regulatory development. To me it sounds like that's when they expect business to have the ALL CLEAR to start going in on Blockchain heavily.#by the sounds of things this could be accelerated!#I just try to look at all the small pieces and add them up into one conclusion. The more time goes by the more solid I am that VeChain will have a big big presence in China and will be working actively with the Chinese government.  It just seems to make sense, time will verify for sure.#> PS Always laughing at pleb narrative that altcoins can “decouple” from btc.Is that your thought for the near future or also years down the road? Our price should eventually be determined by the amount of VTHOR being used with a little speculation and general market action sprinkled in. Otherwise wtf are we doing here?The idea that five or ten years down the road with cryptocurrency potentially being widespread and integrated into our lives, that the entire economy literally can't comprehend the difference in value proposition between any of these systems drives me crazy. I think they eventually will decouple. There will still be general movements of the market led by the top and most notable cryptocurrencies, but the more money in general that comes into this market means more room for astronomical movement within that market. We're just way too fucking early and Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain just entered the lexicon and the word VeChain still isn't even in it.#[deleted]#This is TA logic.

Good news is that although sats might drop it is likely due to btc crushing short term. It will be interesting to see if btc can go sideways for a while and see what happens to the alts in general.

The CEO of Coinbase, the CEO of Binance and heck, even the CEO of WaltonChain also directly tweeted about the news. This demonstrates interest of course, but 'possibly involved' - not even slightly. Not from the tweets anyway. I appreciate the sentiment though.

Naturally some countries lag whilst others embrace new tech (like the current US-China situation). The growth phase starts in 2020, so I guess we’ll see both concurrently.

Just can't wrap my head around this irrationale... What am I missing? For an outside observer, who is not into crypto, I'm just the worst investor there is.#Its Monday and VeForge is dead. Weird feeling as I normally visit this site daily. Trying to stay on the positive side and reading the press release stating that the foundation is going to create an explorer to launch by the end of November, I was thinking about some of the things I would like to see in the new explorer. This blockchain is built on trust and transparency after all. I wonder if we as investors could make some suggestions that the foundation considers as they build the new explorer. What would you guys like to see in the new explorer?  I personally kinda liked the layout and setup of the VeForge one. You could easily find transactions and accounts linked to them ect. It also provided quite a bit of information in a simple manner. The one thing I would like to see is more of a label on some of the big name accounts and contracts. If the companies are willing, label the account ""0X......123 (Walmart China Produce #1)"" or something similar. The same for some of the big name contracts with the sponsor or owner. I think this would increase transparency and give a better idea of who exactly is active on the block chain.  I would also like the ability to download a CSV. or similar file of all transactions associated with an account. So I could have a spreadsheet showing transaction, date, block number, address from, number of clauses... ect.  This would allow a good review and graphs of previous activity of accounts. So once again I ask, what features would you like to see on the new explorer. Maybe we can get a list and pass it on to the foundation.#Dear community, I'm working for a company in the solar industry and we are developing a solution for decentralized charging stations for e-mobility devices (especially e-scooters). We and our investors want the electricity to be - financially - charged via Blockchain for each scooter to be efficient and transparent and since I'm a huge fan of Vechain, it would be great to find the best solution in its capabilities. I also see potentials in combining it with carbon credits and the vechain eco-system etc.My knowledge about the technical background is very limited so I wanted to ask:1: Is Vechains Blockchain (already, and if not at what point) able to do huge amounts of small monetary/fiat transactions for individual electricity prices / scooter charges? 2: Does someone know a Blockchain developer around Berlin who could be interested/employed in helping us developing the dapp (on Vechain.)I'm thankful for any tip!#Maybe I am wrong but main net seems bit more active during this time ( Europe , evening ). Interesting#The new explorer should be on the Vechain website#Good day to all! Just a little reminder - before the new VeChain explorer comes out, it is probably worth downloading Sync and having a little play with the various functions and dApps. You can download here:  https://env.vechain.org/#VIP 191 seems to be the way of the future.  MPP clauses have been very low the last few days. This morning when I woke up in the USA we had 115,091 total clauses of which 105 MPP and **113,030 VIP191**. Now getting close to the end of the trading day we have 132,086 total clauses of which 231 MPP and **128,293 VIP191.**So we added about **14,000 VIP191 clauses** during the day in USA time. This would be from about 8 pm- 6 am China time. First time I have seen this many come in at this time of day. The last time I looked at VeForge right before it closed down for good I saw lines and lines of transactions of 9 clauses  each all VIP191 paid for by the same address that paid for some VIP191 Walmart China produce transactions last week.  Maybe Walmart was up loading some data all night? Im not sure.#https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/21/us/recall-walmart-frozen-meat-trnd/index.htmlWould be nice if you scan your product at home to see if it's in an infected batch.Even better, you get a notification your food is infected you just bought.All on Blockchain ofcourse.#>I just published What you might not know about VeChainThor yet (Part VI) — On-Chain Governance>https://bbs.vechainworld.io/topic/304/what-you-might-not-know-about-vechainthor-yet-part-vi-on-chain-governancehttps://twitter.com/PeterZh47977516/status/1186531515414376448?s=20#I’m heading to Italy next week.

On Saturday we had a total of 2,709 economic nodes. Now today we only have 2,688. That means over **20 economic nodes were destroyed yesterday** from people pulling everything from there ledger in a panic. I think most just moved everything to OceanEx or Binance so they could at least still access their funds. I checked, every economic node lost was a strength node. This is not normal, up until today it has always been a steady growth in the number of economic nodes. It didn't have to be like this if Totient could have been a little more professional.  I feel bad for people who worked hard to get a node just to lose it due to confusion and a very very short time frame to make a big decision.#If/when is Walmart starting back up?

It is no coincidence every time Bitcoin was forked it kept the name bitcoin and then some letters were added to it. A small percentage of the world knows about Crypto those who do for sure know what Bitcoin is. One day a friend in college was talking about Bitcoin and that is  what started it all for me. Now I am here and have seen many aspects of the crypto space.  I guarantee any coin named Bitcoin anything has much more exposure simply because of the name.  Bitcoin SV has no utility, it is just a store of value and its all about buy and sell volume. It basically gets free marketing because the original Bitcoin set the trend to make people very wealthy several years ago. No one has gotten stupid rich off of Vechain (**Yet**)... Several people are very very wealthy because of an early investment in Bitcoin. The majority of the world do not fully understand the power behind VeChain it is still relativity new. Also Bitcoin SV is crap. Craig Wright is a con. I would not try to buy and flip that crap with your money, much less my own.#Because it's an airdrop coin the whales have a lot of fund on either side of the btc-btsv pair.

The timing isn't that great but it won't matter in the end. Veforge was great, sure. But it has been the same forever with no new features. They did great on standing it up, if they haven't figured out how to monetize or keep the lights on up until now they could have said ""this isn't profitable, so we're going to shut down in 3 months"" Hell, I'd expect more time in a resignation. You can tell there's for sure salt there how everything is worded. They can say forever how much they appreciate the community but with them dropping in 24 hours they're not hurting the foundation, they're hurting the community.Sorry I was out this weekend and just catching up. As far as features it would be great to combine this as well as the vechain stats page. Would love to have it all in one. No shade at Vechain stats at all. That site is done very well and all the updates are appreciated.  And as I'm sure it's been said 1000x to have more historical data would be awesome.#The Explorer should focus on vtho and vtho value: vtho transaction values over time, vtho transaction fluctuation, the value of vet in relation to vtho.

I personally see no reason why the foundation should pay them a huge amount of money for an explorer service. I think the real issues is the VIP191 protocol, It is my understanding that that Totient put in quite a bit of work to make the VIP 191 a reality. Then boom in the last week almost all clauses have switch to VIP191 and Totient is saying hey we developed that and now everyone is using it  sooo pay us more money. Big picture is VeChain was most likely happy to work with Totient but they do not need them to survive. If Totient approaches with an ultimatum it seems clear what the foundations response was. Whats done is done and I think Totient might have a little regret but who knows. I personally wish it was more of a transition and Veforge could stay live another month or so until the new one is ready. I think that would have been the professional thing for Totient to do, instead of be salty and pull the plug instantly. Within two months none of it will matter and we will be on to bigger and better things. I am excited to see the new VeChain Explorer.#I don't blame Totient at all for the quick abandonment.  If I put myself in their shoes - I bet they felt entitled to a good chunk of that R&D budget, as well as start up funding.  They were providing core functionality and actually upgraded the Vechain network - have there been any other dev teams outside the Foundation that can say that? I sure haven't seen anything coming from anywhere else, so I'm guessing that Totient got tired of providing critical support for no cost while Vechain sat on startup funding for future dev teams that may or may not be coming to the network.  They were pretty much alone in the dev spotlight and probably wanted to be treated that way. On the other hand, Veforge wasn't that great.  It only showed a tiny window of network usage, the USD value meant nothing really...switching between mainnet and testnet was cool I guess, but my favourite accounts were forgotten several times ( Perhaps there should be an actual account login )...  I'm actually sursprised Vechain never built their own explorer... this is probably where the boundaries in the Vechain:Totient relationship fell apart.  Vechain responded to the Totient news well enough, but they really dropped the ball on building their own core services to begin with... The other difficult issue is for sure the massive drop in value of both vet and the entire alt market.  Thankfully Vechain are in a position to have alternate funding... but startups on a startup - that's damn sketchy business right there. This sets an interesting tone for future Dev teams showing up to the party - you better be building apps that generate your own revenue or be willing to take a possible financial hit to provide community run services.  This alone makes me wonder if Vechain will ever have a thriving dev community outside their partnerships and the foundation while the value of vtho and vet keep dropping. TLDR  Vechain is failing to build a dev community  Veforge and Comet weren't anything special.Edit: downvoting won’t increase your vet value and entertaining criticism is good for all of us.#Any negative will be spun around by fanatics. Nothing about VET explorer being down counts as a positive. Keep yourself deluded but dont brainwash others.#Yes the Vault is gone. Ledger owners such as myself are kinda in the dark right now. The Ledger stores your address and private keys, the coins are stored on the blockchain in the wallet. The Vault was the middle man (viewer) to allow you to connect your hardware Ledger to the blockchain. The coins are safe the only issue is you can no longer access them. The Vault was the only VeChain Ledger interface BUT the VeChain foundation said yesterday they are creating an in house Ledger interface that will work with the Sync desktop wallet. It should be ready within two weeks from today. So basically you can not move or even access your funds with your Ledger for two weeks. No worries soon it will be all good again.#In the medium article they gave a window of about 2 weeks wait for ledger functionality.#Not trying to be the party pooper, but he stated he has not enough time/capacities#In the wallet would be nice#An app is a great idea. I posted below asking for suggestions. I still think somehow we need to compile them all and try to send them to the foundation. Maybe they can integrate it into the new system coming.#It will be back up soon enough, don’t worry. Did you move your tokens because of VeForge?#If your VET are ledger bound, they’re perfectly fine until the new interface comes out.Once you’ve downloaded Sync you will see ‘developer tools’ which will inform you of every and any piece of developer related information for the VeChainThor blockchain as well as tutorials and tips. Skills-wise, you can be amateur and build relatively simply dApps or be as complex as you like. The blockchain is multi-language although I’m not 100% what they are off the top of my head without checking for myself. I’m sure there are some blockchain specific factors involved, but I can’t comment with any authority. There is a developer channel via Sync where you can ask the pros :)# 0x27942b0D71919C4Aa81b7Ae6BA951150Faef5ae6 This is the address of the VIP191 gas payer. They transferred in 50 Million VTHO about 24 hours ago. Since then they have burned 2 million of those. It was posting transactions all day today.#[VeChainStats.com](https://VeChainStats.com)#If the salmonella can be detected before it hits the shelves they wouldn't have to be tracked. Vechain's use case is that it provides a rapid response time in case something goes wrong.#Typical Dutch.#thank you.#If it is the fiat on ramp i’m going to streak down the main street next to me#Exactly why I posted this. This one was put on the VeChain blockchain last Tuesday the 15th and it was paid for via VIP191.  The VIP191 address that paid the VTHO has also been paying for and clicking off transactions all morning. This same address also transferred in 50 million VTHO yesterday evening. I don't know for sure but the next few days could be interesting. I think there are products on the shelf right now at Walmart in China with VeChain tags one them and all of Walmart has switched to VIP191.#No I am talking about today, right now.I know a guy posted that he was no longer seeing the tags on the mushrooms and that is what started the whole ""did Walmart leave"" conversation. This was a month or so ago.I think it would be worth someones time, who is local, to go check and see what is on the shelf right now as we speak.#Chill out. Walmart is still activity posting data on the block chain right now. No need to over think#They still have it on medium... so I guess they'd delete the banner from their homepage, if they really wanted to extinct every piece.

Thank you!#What a great site, thanks bro.#Kwontik is legendary man#But my 4 yr old son tells me 10 days is forever.#Obviously it is not the end of the world.

You might have moved your VET holdings to Binance. In doing so your node was destroyed#Weird. I can still access.#Strange.

Funny thing is I knew it was coming when I typed it. Sorry they cant all be serious. Lighten up a little guys.#For those down voting, it's obviously /s Jesus guys.#In my opinion, I hope this is not the case. Sunny is the leader of VeChain, the main face and name associated with the foundation. It has been stated from day one this project is built off of trust and transparency. I would like to think he will make smart decisions on whats best for the entire project before padding his own pocket. If he can delay the gratification now and make sacrifices to get this thing really going it will pay him so much more in the long run. We as investors will also benefit greatly from this scenario.For some reason, I get the feeling he is a stand up guy no matter what the other say. He seems more like the kind of guy who wants to solve a problem first and reap the rewards second (which is what we need). He literally left Louis Vuitton because he recognized the issue with counterfeit goods and wanted to fix it. That is a big leap and takes some drive to make that jump.This project needs a leader who strives for progress and mass adoption, not a guy just out chasing dollars. As I said, I believe and trust him. If I didn't I would have never put a single dollar into this thing.s#It is something I honestly believe in also.  It is as simple as that.#First I would say you need to spend sometime doing your own research on the project. I mean this in a nice way because if I have money in something I want to know what is going on for the most part.To sum it up simply, Yes most likely one day this project will have some serious value to it. Why? Simple it is one of the only crypto projects that solves a real world problem.The combination of blockchain, IoT, and Supply Chain has so much potential it is insane. We are literally just waiting for the world to catch on and start using it.Vechain has spent the time the last two years building the infrastructure. It is ready to go. 2020-2023 should be the growth phase for this project. I have a good feeling the DVN-GL 900,000 wallets coming in January 2020 is going to be the kick start we need to really get this thing rolling. We are close, just hold strong.I have been and will continue to accumulate more VET until the end of the year most likely.#When it comes to coins like these it's a matter of who can hold their breath the longest.#As this gains traction and more companies come online they can start relying on the data from a blockchain explorer, or any integration with the explorer they want to add (additional features?)Think about Walmart having integration with a part of vechain that wasn't reliant on the foundation and they just decide to up and shut it down, actual customers would be down until vechain can get a solution up in place. That would be a massive black eye.  It could easily be said ""Why is a critical part of your infrastructure relying on a 3rd party you have no control over?""Now they'll be in control of that and will be more stable. we see first hand now how it can go bad.Edit: Bad news would be if vechain came out with a reply of ""Well, we don't NEED an explorer, and I'm sure a dev will step up with a Ledger connection"" I felt their response was very responsible, and very fast to roll out to the community to keep everyone up to speed along with timelines of when to expect the new stuff.#Well that’s slightly terrifying. I know the funds are there but I can’t access them. It’s almost like there isn’t a point to a hardware wallet. My private keys but not my coins?#agree. as long as i dont have to open my browser for it and refresh its all fine for me.#I don't plan on moving any tokens. I'm Ledger'd up. I have a little bit of play money on Oceanex so this doesn't impact me too much but the message says they'll be back up at 0930 on the 22nd, so....tomorrow?#Would it be possible to create/deploy a smart contract that sends my vtho to oceanex periodically/upon reaching a target ?#Great, thanks.#My reply was to the previous poster that mentioned that the product / package could inform the consumer during or after purchase of any contamination or similar. And in that scenario it feels a bit late if the information was already available.#It's not much better than having an eco node on a day to day basis, but as someone who plans to hold for a few years - the extra vtho generation is worth it.#RemindMe! 2 days ""pictures or it didnt happen""#[deleted]#Why are your pics asking for 18+ confirmation? lol.#This sub has always been a tough crowd#[removed]#I trust the foundation to come back with an interface soon but yes it is a little scary. I considered pulling everything yesterday from my Ledger to a new mobile wallet on my phone. In the end I decided to stay where I am and ride it out. I think we will be good to go in about two weeks. Its your keys and address on the Ledger, you just have no way to sync that Ledger to the block chain where the actual coins are. It so secure not even you can access it, much less a thief.# [https://insight.vecha.in/#/](https://insight.vecha.in/#/) I love the way this updates.#Yeah, looks like that’s the case. I thought you might have moved your tokens to avoid ledger access loss only to be doubly smited. I saw some of the community were talking about it yesterday.#I don’t know in all honesty. I assume you would need to grant it access to your private key which may not be desirable from a security perspective. If you have the mobile wallet you can just use Vexchange.io for the same effect, albeit with a few extra steps (still very straightforward and simple though)#They said 'at home' though. So the scenario is that someone eats something wrong, the contaminated package gets scanned and immediately everyone else gets to scan theirs to see if its safe. The alarm feature can work but people would have to scan in all their groceries preemptively to get a notification on their phone should something be wrong. Seems like a lot of work.#I will be messaging you on [**2019-10-23 20:59:44 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2019-10-23%2020:59:44%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://np.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/dkzlyp/daily_vechain_discussion_october_21_2019/f4nora3/)[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FVechain%2Fcomments%2Fdkzlyp%2Fdaily_vechain_discussion_october_21_2019%2Ff4nora3%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202019-10-23%2020%3A59%3A44%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20dkzlyp)There is currently another bot called u/kzreminderbot that is duplicating the functionality of this bot.

So far good signs of stable growth.#Nom nom nom 😋#Continuation of the buyback maybe? We are almost two weeks into the 4th quarter and they need to buy another $5 million by the end of the year. From watching the buyback wallet transfers in of 25million VET where most popular. IE it seems they favor buying in 25 million increments.#It could definitely be related to San Marino#There's so many protected brand names out there in food alone, it would be awesome if Vechain can get involved with those to protect their exclusiveness. It's not even that far fetched and basically just another adoption of what is already being rolled out in Wallmart China. It would be huge if this could spread on significant scales to items outside of China. I personally think it's only a matter of time and VET has the best market position through it's network/partners and chain capabilities to be the tool used to track this on huge scales.#Seems to be the case right now.#You can move it.  It’s a pain,  but can be done.  Using VeForge in tandem with the mobile observe wallet.#You misheard. They weren't going to give you a shirt.

Atleast that way you could move the checks away from the border itself, but I wonder how they could check the initial registration on the chain if they're letting companies themselves do so? Would be pretty easy to falsify the entry. I'm no expert but I do think a decentralized trustless chain (verified by parties both sides trust e.g. DNV/GL and other AN's once revealed) might be part of the solution long term but not a fix in itself.#[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cfI5on5n84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cfI5on5n84)If they go with a high tech solution for customs then it's a possibility that blockchain could be a part of the solution but it is not ""the"" solution.#You can't walk away from the worlds largest trading block without it damaging your economy. That isn't something vechain can fix. The good friday agreement which brought peace in Ireland stipulated there should be no hard border between north and south. If the UK (well England really, they call the shots cause it's not really a union it's what England wants that counts) want to do a Brexit they need to break the peace agreement.  An international agreement signed and witnessed by world leaders. That's tricky.#I have posted my thoughts on this issue several times here and on the UK Telegram group. Regardless of the politics involved I believe blockchain (specifically VeChain) could represent a critical element in creating a ‘soft’ border solution for the Irish Border. The recent report mentioned [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/dg297n/uk_national_infrastructure_commission_future_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) touches on how this might happen and VeChain/DBSchenker are even mentioned.#Hahaha I wish it was that easy#I think we’ll start the march upwards once we start seeing the daily VTHO burn rate regularly exceeding the natural supply#It's funny seeing the 1 VET test transfers. We all do it.#Good catch. Seeing the behaviour of the source wallet (sending all daily generated VTHO every day) this is indeed most likely the 2.5B from the Economic node pool.From the whitepaper: ""The allocated VET in VTHO Reward Pool reduces by 2.5 billion every 6 months, until further notice after 29 Feb 2020."" I would've expected it to move a month earlier, but there can be multiple reasons why that didn't happen. Does anyone know what happened after the first pool reduction? Did they sell it? I can ofcourse check the financial reports, but if someone knows it already that's a waste of time.#Vechainstats.com - transactions- fee delegation#[deleted]#[removed]#Even better then!#He's referring to the big amount of clauses. Which is really interesting considering its a saturday!#Ok so OceanEx actually received about 53.6 million OCE as the total subscription amount was about 134 million XMX. Now since they only give out 17.2 million XMX in this sale, the actual amount of OCE that is burned is 6.88 million (17.2M * 0,4).Depending on how much of the total OCE you submitted for the sale you get an equivalent portion of the XMX that were sold.Here’s an example: you subscribed with the maximum of 250k XMX or 100k OCE. 250k (your subscription amount) / 134 million (total subscription amount) = 0,187%Multiply that by 17.2 million (total XMX given out) and you get the portion you’ll receive (around 32k in this case).The rest of the OCE that you sent will be sent back to you. So since you get 32k XMX * 0,4 you will have paid almost 13k OCE and will get back 87k from them.Hope the formatting is ok since I wrote this on my phone.#Thank you man! Much appreciated 👍 Happy Friday#Are you able to collect your VTHO bubbles using the favorite function?

Do you also go out and give food and clothes to the homeless? Guy like you must dedicate a lot of time to helping others.#Depends how your strategy is no? If you're buying now and are looking at long term plays that could create real network (and so token) value, then there's not much better than VET at this stage as it os proven to have real use, unlike 99.999% of other tokens.If you're after something that will likely give quick growth right now to cash out of but will also dump terribly eventually then look elsewhere (i.e speculation hype investments). Be smart and have 2 pots... one for long term, and then another for short term flips.#I already sold all my bitcoin, what more do you want from me?#if you say so, it must be true. sold everything, thanks stranger!#lol#[removed]#So CCK = Totient? hehe#- Optimum Nutrition Gold standard- Muscletech Platinum Creatine- UA- it's all bollox.#Left hand side there is a number 3.25 on some milk jug or whatever it is.

I would also like $.74 worth of VTHO that will soon be $.32#It got pepper sprayed in Hong Kong.#Viral marketer for Vechain who ""leaked"" partnership hints before they were formally announced. His big thing was that everything would burn and then the VeChain phoenix would rise from the ashes. Scroll his old tweets.Amusing at first.

If this project fails, I have no hope for the entire Market!I mean ""nothing changed"" like why would someone even consider to sell at this point (just because the price dropped recently)..oh man😅#Haha, read it once more, Jeff :)#Lol damn Jeff usually you get such upvoted comments never seen downvotes thrown at you like this lolPpl gonna be grumpy, it’s life#[deleted]#Black Friday deals powered by vechain, right?#Calm down, everyone here's so fucking touchy lately. It's called hopium not nopium.#No. It's not self preservation. Unlike a lot of people here I have 0 emotional attachment to my investment. I'm not scared about price or whatever. This whole fucking 'China scam' could go to zero and I'll be like ""Welp. Research better next time""But I think I've researched fine this time around and I have a feeling, regardless of what you think that feeling might represent over the internet, that from here on out things will start getting more positive. Like I said. Maybe not in price. But I have a bit of trust in dnvgl when they say poc era is over and exponential growth is underway. I think it's soon. And I think this right here, Today, is about as dead, quiet, and low as we're gonna go. It's a feeling. Based on shit all but my mind connecting all the info that I've gathered about this project in the last 2 years. But. Fuck me if I ain't gonna tell you guys about it :)#It's still a feeling#I hope to God btc stays asleep until vechains own tokenomics kick in. Can you imagine at the very very start of the next bull run Vechain is the only token that's providing real value to its holders. If we're burning more than we're generating when sentiment around crypto changes, and we are the ONLY non speculative asset in the space.Hooooly boyos. Who wants a hit of this hopium bong.#Prior to the launch of the futures market, the only way to gain with crypto was to buy and hold btc. After the launch of the futures market, the big boys can also sell and make tons of money. And they'll play these games over and over again, pump first, dump on everyone and make money both directions. Little fish get caught with pants down. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, btc will experience extremely wild swings. Not even sure if it can make its way to new highs given how greedy the huge players are. VET will be taken for a ride with btc. It will take a long time for BTC to gain enough market cap and distribution that the whales can move the needle only so much. Keep safe out there.#That's okay. I don't fear down votes haha. But. We are slowly entering into the growth phase. We're not going be this low forever. I mean we might. But that's not why we're here. We're here cause we're investors in a revolutionary technology that's just starting to enter adoption. And after all the ""poc era is over"" and ""exponential growth incoming"" type comments we hear from dnvgl, I can't help but feel sometime real soon, next 3 months or so, we should really be seeing some positive sentiment. I'm here to take that future positive sentiments and predict it now :P#Yeah it’s really nice of him. R/cc has a similar set of magnanimous types who will type paragraphs out to ‘help’ other investors. They’ve even been at it for years now, truly looking out for the common man and not trying to mislead, troll or otherwise FUD this project repeatedly like they have a specific agenda or anything.

Hmmmm#I wouldn't bother trying to look for anything in this image that I'm pretty sure has existed for longer than the VeChainThor blockchain.#Eh still could have jumped the gun and rubbed a partner the wrong way. It happens, people get trigger happy and excited and sometimes its tough to keep a big secret. BMW is an obvious one that kind of comes to mind. Didn’t we blow the lid off that well before it was confirmed by bmw? Anyway, I’m just speculating and you could be right, but I work in tech and advertising and have seen stuff like this too many times to not infer that is maybe what happened.#Like I said, you're a trusted member of the community and I doubt you would do that, I just saw it as an oppurtunity to teach/warn others so they're aware and can be skeptical going into the future. Not everyone has the same intentions :)#Thnx.#Doubtful. Likely private as this kind of data would probably be kept private#Ah, Solomon may be busy today. If you want to message the modmail that makes it easiest, since all mods get to view it and are able to jump in when they have something to say. We can sort it out in there :) There's always one of us online, Solomon is definitely the most interactive mod though#As I read it a second time I see it in a different context.  Seemed at first you were predicting a price drop in 2021........Truth is you are saying current price wont even matter come 2021.  Seems I did misunderstand you the first time. My bad.  My comment above still stands to some of the other people I see floating around here and twitter.#I have failed at the internet today...... will return tomorrow#My nam Jef#[deleted]#Fair enough!  I am the same really, not too emotional about it.#Help, I done hoperdosed#Im not saying the rollercoaster changes just saying that the sideways movement we’ve seen is bound to track up at some point. It may go down first but over time, you have to play the odds. Just remember, new people are buying btc every single day. The investor pool is and has been growing over btc lifespan. Once we begin pushing up and gain sustained sideways movement at newer bottoms, anxiousness is going to ease and you will have more money flowing into all viable spaces and projects including VET.#The funniest part is how we’re all in this together. We come here for updates and hopium (and to be miserable together). Nobody is threatening our families if we don’t hold, but it is pretty hilarious how when market sentiment is down suddenly we’re downvoting the optimists as in it’s all their fault we’re still holding lol#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

I believe, several days ago, I stumbled upon the Walmart China Wallet on the Veforge Explorer. IF it is the Walmart wallet ( I am fairly certain it is) the last transactions were posted on September 17th. About 19 days ago. This wallet has a little over 4,000 transactions from middle of June until middle of September. A period of almost exactly **90 days**. Almost every transaction is a full 40 clauses and every one is paid for by the same MPP contract. On average this means about 45 transactions a day containing 1800 clauses a day. Seems very reasonable for a 90 day mainnet ""test run"" of some mushrooms and basic produce in a few Walmart China stores. I fully expect this wallet to come back alive in the next few weeks and believe what others have stated recently. Walmart China was active for almost exactly 90 days ( a business quarter) they then stopped all activity to reevaluate and update the system which is expected to come back online in the next few weeks with even more activity. Once the bugs and small issues are all worked out I believe we will start to see a major ramp up in activity.  Additionally, in doing some of this research I now have a **theory** that this Walmart China partnership is a small part of one big deal that is coming to VeChain from China. I will post more about this later when I do some more research on it.#>$VET>Walmart TX info>$BTC $ETH $SHAhttps://twitter.com/wazapepe/status/1180887784195837959#Just a quick note to say we'll be going live with our contracts and first auction very soon and it must be known that VeriArti is 1/10th cheaper (and a hell of a lot easier) to mint your own custom NFT on VeChain than the strongest competitor, and 1/50th (yes that's right) cheaper than another proof-of-authority registrar to STAMP your own IP rights. It's soon time for us to let the crypto space know that VeChain is a dapp haven and I can assure you VeriArti is not the only dapp being built on VeChain that will make this clear.

Let‘s see. There‘s progress but growth is not exponential right now so I think patience is key.c) major new bull market. It‘s not around the corner at all. Can happen next month, can happen in 2 years. Who knows. But for alts to really explode, there‘s a high chance we need new investors and mainstream folks joining the party in large numbers. I don‘t see it right now. People have been burnt or scared away so it will take some time. BTC reaching a new ATH might help but it‘s not around the corner either.TLDR: high chance we won‘t moon in the next 6-12 months#Is it possible to purchase BYD stock?#Riding tic talk to the grave..fun knowing you guys...miracle be appreciated...news on how awesome this incubation project Is would be wonder bar.

Market Cap is simply the value of all the tokens (Price per token \* Number of Tokens).So price per token = Market Cap / Current Supply...... so $1 Billion/ 63.03 Billion Tokens = **$.015** per VET token#Current MC (188M) x 5,5 = 1 billion, Increase current price by 5,5 as well#0.018 per VETJust devide 1bil by the circulating supply: 55,454,734,800#I'm already buying, is anyone with me?#Diana has put away her bosom.

Don't even allow myself to investigate on financial level.  I might read an article about it, but that's all.#This is going to happen for a long time (years) with the amount of tokens they hold. They'll continue to pile on sells to fund operations for a few years. Until they're around 20% token holders the price won't find its actual value.#unfortunately I don't think you'll ever have that level of transparency. So many companies, and charities too, can use umbrella terms like 'developemtn' 'research' and so on, and a lot of the cases they simply don't have the man power or technology to show literally every micro-payment. However you could certainly track a company as far as their blockchain reach goes but of course you're not going to have  a lot people on the ground in third-world countries who will want to be paid in crypto. So it's a step but not totally transparent.#Part of the planOnly naive kiddo would think that those “buyers” and “sellers” can’t buy/sell into each other if they really wanted to make real trades. Those walls are there for a reason.#Ideal events - transaction volume ramping up significantly in the next 6mo -12mo gaining attention, adding even more big clients (1000 use cases in the pipelines suggests there are a few) creating a big name for VET, tokenomics kicking in and organic growth happening as a result, showing the power of a well thought economic model and the notion a token economy can function outside of bitcoin. THEN bull run... 🚀 I don’t think we’ll see the next bull run until more mainstream adoption of blockchain personally. Plenty of people need to know this asset class is ‘safe’ and a huge portion of them won’t dip their toes until regulators and officials say its fine, put protections and regulations in place/stamp out scammy ICOs etc. Then comes the next stampede. But with the halving round the corner and some big exchanges from the real world potentially listing bitcoin, who knows what could happen!#If this surprised you, your predictions won't be very reliable#We might not moon that quick but I disagree. A lot of transactions are coming Q4, thats pretty soon in my opinion.

I personally havent and wont touch it.#Tic wasn’t an incubated project, FYI, although it received a little bit of support in terms of exposure via VeChain.#So I am going to assume you have a large amount of $$$ to buy into VET. Say enough to buy 2.5 Million VET Tokens right now($8,500). I picked this number for a reason. Options 1, You want to buy two VeThor X Nodes where current average price is 631,000 VET each. So you just spent 1,262,000 VET on two VeThor X Nodes and have 1,238,000 VET left. (*You need 600,000 VET to maintain each VeThor X Node, hence why we started with 2.5 Million VET)*. So now you have 2 accounts, each with 619,000 VET and a VeThor X Node.  Each will now generate 278 VTHO a day. So **556 VTHO a day total** between both. Option 2, starting with 2.5 million VET, you buy 1 Strength X Node for avg price of 559,000 VET. You have one account with 1,941,000 VET and a Strength X Node.  You generate **1,152 VTHO a day total** in one account. Option 3, starting with 2.5 million VET, you dont buy any X Node. You have one account with 2.5 Million VET and a free economic strength node you generated after 10 days of holding over 1 million VET. You now generate **1,308 VTHO a day total** in one account. My question to you now is why buy an X node at all if your main goal is to maximize VTHO generation? X Node future value is speculation even though there is a limited supply no one know what they really will be worth. When you buy an Xnode for 500k-600k VET you are giving up 500k-600k tokens that generate VTHO at .000432 each for a node that only generates .0000174 (VeThor X) or .0001661 (Strength X) per REMAINING VET in your wallet after paying for the X Node.#The vtho generation rate does not double by having 2 VeThor X nodes. You would splitting your stack between the two nodes, thus it's better to have it all earning the higher rate in the Strength X.#Because two x nodes cost more than one?#A company can use more than one company's services. Plus IBM and VeChain offer different blockchain solutions.#It means Walmart US and IBM **could possibly** be working with VeChain on this. Rumors of a potential VeChain and IBM big partnership have been floating around for months but no one knows for sure. For some reason I have a feeling Vechain is not involved in this being that it is with Walmart US. But I could be wrong we will see.Alot of people want to see VeChain involved with US companies and I think that could be great in the future, however do not over look the potential for VeChain business coming from China and other parts of the world.For example, If the DNV-GL MY STORY is really going track **every single bottle** of wine exported from Italy that is massive and mind blowing when it comes to the amount of transactions it will create on the blockchain.I guess I am saying don't get to caught up trying to look into US deals when big things are happening in other places.#Its the exact same. No matter if you have 3 million VET in one account with one economic strength node, or you have 3 accounts with 1 million each and a strength node in each.You will still generate a total of **1570 VTHO a day.** The only benfit of having 3 separate account is you have 3 nodes instead of one. When you sell your nodes one day you will have 3 to sell instead of just 1.#Same VTHO rewards, no financial gain!#3 strength nodes. Better security if you split your eggs.#Interesting that you are jumping to conclusions. I am fairly certain today is the last day of the Chinese holiday and you can see an obvious drop in MPP clauses since the start of this holiday.Second, the VIP191 clauses ramped up from basically 0 to 20,000-30,000 a day and are still holding steady. All the activity you saw over the weekend were from these new clauses.#Sunday today. The week ahead should be ok.#Saw a translated post from wechat, that Walmart is upgrading right now. The upgrade should be finished this month with more products onboarded. Dunno if legit but i trust the guy who posted it...so lets hope and wait#I stress it is only a **theory** but I am going to try to post about it tomorrow.# [https://www.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/dez10t/daily\_vechain\_discussion\_october\_08\_2019/f31cxy1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/dez10t/daily_vechain_discussion_october_08_2019/f31cxy1/)#Would love to check out the address as well#1800 x 45 a day#But you have no way to prove all of that activity was Walmart. It is pure speculation on your part because the activity came around the same time frame as the Walmart news. I am pretty sure all of those clauses came from **multiple** sources. You guys have no patience and just want an instant moonshot out of this thing or what? You have to think about the current scale of activity. Walmart China only has 431 total stores as compared to the US with 3,566 stores. You dont know how many stores the food tracking was deployed in China? Was it all 431? Was it only 10 or 20? Additionally they only  tracked a few product lines, mainly mushrooms it seems. Its 45 transactions a day each of 40 clauses. So 1800 total items per day on average every day for 90 days. This sounds very reasonable to me for a test run of mushrooms and other produce in a handful of stores. But the truth is I don't even know for sure if that is what they did. For you to just think Walmart China comes on board and instantly on day one they give you 500,000 clauses is a little crazy. I think it will come but in time. For now we wait patiently.#How about 1 Trillion, million, billion.#Circulating supply is more than what coinmarketcap show. See financial report.#Totally underrated movie. So many quotable lines.#the jur/vet price i mean.#I'm thinking one of them is partially buyback#Don‘t get me wrong. I‘m a very long term optimistic OG. But I stopped believing in things to come. I start to believe in things I see #transactions.That said, I continue to accumulate on a monthly basis. 😎#A higher volume of transactions will make no difference - unless you are expecting it to jump to the millions/day?#I have heard that it itself is provieing incubation support for another chain?#I made a mistake, thx for clearing it out. To your question though as to why buy an X node at all: Where would you think Vechain will be in 10 years from now? I believe that If Vechain grabs a piece of the large pie then having the X status will eventually be anyones wet dream. It seems wrong to wait now and generate more of nothing instead of locking up that position and be ready for when that plane (or rocket if you will) takes off. Vethor generation isn’t hardly worth the investment now (economic or X status) but i believe it will be in the future. Who will be willing to sell their X status when we enter the real bull?#Thx for your post.#Uhhhm...1 vethor X 600K1 strenght X 1600k#Indeed. Companies are big - especially Fortune 500 companies. Enterprises use multiple services. Still, I do wonder if it has anything to do with the aforementioned hybrid model. Legit don't know. But yea, just bc A happens doesn't mean that B can't happen as well. Will be interesting to see what transpires !#Mystory in Italy is boombastic. Amazing news!  Alla grande!#Thank you, but why should anyone buy a strengh node ?#I have my vet in my Ledger/Veforge. So i would need 3 ledgers. No poin in having them all in one veforge account.#That entire comment holds 0 conclusions so I don't know why you jumped to the conclusion that they were jumping to conclusions, but I'm going to jump to the conclusion that you misunderstood#Guess we will find out soon enough. Thanks for the info , can’t wait for the 100 product lines#Can you explain why you trust him?#Please do - and I'm sorry if you have already, but could you link the wallet in question? All the best.#Interesting, with release of the hyperledger news and Walmart.#Thanks so much for the heads up#Well 81,000 clauses a day still a bigger peanut#You don’t have proof as well that only 81000 per day comes from Walmart. Don’t judge people based your own assumptions. I didn’t judge you to have no patience just because you claim Walmart produce 81000 clauses a day. I assume Walmart produce more than 81000 based on the time when it was announced, that has nothing to be a moonboy. Idiot!#10x from that and I'm retired.#Which flick is that am drawing a blank#Ah i zoomed out and now i see the familiar pattern#Buyback is also part of the plan. Le Big Plan  )#The economic model is based on Tx volumes - It just needs to get across the VTHO generation rate for the economics to function properly. Not even that, it’s the VTHO market participation rate which is even less than daily VTHO gen. We almost hit daily VTHO gen. at about 1million Tx a day so I don’t think we necessarily need millions, although obviously the more the better. We just need to be actively reducing the VTHO stockpile which comes by proxy of demand for VeChainThor’s services. Which feasibly can be achieved at around a million Tx a day. Something I don’t think is unfeasible by the end of next year given the number of use cases to come online from DNVGL, PwC and Deloitte helping their clients onboard on to the network.Edit: just realised you meant in Q4. Probably not 😅#Apologies, I misunderstood your initial comment. I thought you meant it was incubated by VeChain/CREAM. I’m not sure what’s going on over at TIC HQ, but it has been raising some eyebrows.#The real question is who will be buying the X Node during the real bull run? If I am a multi million dollar business what benefit do I have buying an X Node from you in 5 years?  It seems the only benefit to an X Node is bonus generation of VTHO which means more gas to fuel business transactions on the blockchain.  The math above proves the X Node doesn't generate as much as normal generation rate VET. The normal generation rate of VET will never go down only up. The only way I see real value is if the X Node generation rate grows exponentially compared to the normal VET generation rate. As I have stated the future value of the X Node is complete speculation. The biggest positive to them is that there is a limited supply in existence.  Them being ""rare"" is the only thing giving them any current value. Buy one if you want its just a gamble.#NO! This is the required amount of VET needed to keep the node. You have to buy the X Node and also keep 600,000 VET in your account or the VeThor X Node will be destroyed.You have to keep 1,600,000 VET in your account of the Strength X Node will be destroyed. You can buy a Strength X on the market right now for 590,000 VET and they are generally cheaper than the VeThor X price to buy one.  VeThor X right now cost 660,000 VET#[removed]#The economic ones are basically worthless on the open market. You have to hold 1 Million VET to maintain a Strength Node. Once you get 1 Million VET there is a 10 day waiting period to generate the node. The only reason you buy one off the open market is because you do not want to wait the 10 days. If you buy one with less than 1 Million VET in your account the node will be automatically destroyed. If you have the 1 Million VET its only 10 days to get the node for free so why buy one. Prices are dirt cheap for economic nodes and I do not see many sell. The people who do buy them don't realize the mistake they made by being impatient.#They shouldn't.#My ledger had 5 accounts when I sign into VeForge. You should too. You can do it all with one Ledger.#you dont need 3 ledgers. you just need 3 mmenoic phrases.Just set up the first account, then factory reset ledger. Generate a new 24 word phrase, set that one up and factory reset it again.Saves you some money.#He clearly said we are dead..... when in fact we are seeing brand new transactions coming through that we have never seen before. Sounds like brand new life to me. Then I pointed out that the 'normal' data clauses are low because the Chinese holiday is still going on. Make of it what you will.#Well he never posted bullshit so far and is a down to earth guy. Maybe trust is not the right word. Lets say there are no reasons not to believe him.#And they are expanding that now. Tells us that many many people thought Wal-Mart made way more transactions than they did#Yea you made an assumption of best case scenario and a high amount of transactions because it would benefit you and your investment the most. Now if you are wrong it leads to disappointment. Things are much worse than you hoped. However if you assume worst case scenario ( a low amount of transactions) and you are wrong you can only be pleasantly surprised and it turns out things are better than you expected.Its a safety factor, think smart and reasonable. I can almost guarantee you Walmart is not generating a massive amount of transactions like most people think...... at least not yet hopefully.#Role Models#Please tell me more about Le Big Plan that relates to these buy and sell walls?#Great points. Worth adding the x node pool also doesnt decrease like the economic reward pool.#I see, if VET becomes big then todays vethor generation rate will not cut it. This is where X nodes !should! benefit. I’m talking maybe 5 years from now. It’s all speculation, maybe i’m just a real believer and want to seal the future.#X nodes generate more than the tokens generation you lose by buying it when you have lots of vet. The more vet you have the better return will a x-node have#Wups :)#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

The buyback address has less than 5m usd worth of VET. Which also means they bought back with higher average price than current price.So my theory now is the reaccumulation.. just don’t know until when. Maybe mark up only at the end of buyback june 2020 or could be earlier#haha all good#Walmart selloff was also a part of the plan, they knew market wasn’t ready for a true reversal, so yeah a bull trap. But we could also see one more average bull trap before reversal.#I’m putting my $$ on my theory that the bull trap was over. They always deliver what they said. And they said they will buy 5m usd worth of VET in first quarter they will do it. So far they bought over 1B VET in first quarter which means they bought at average price of 0.005 USD. Current price 0.0032-34 represents 32-34% discount from their first quarter purchase price. I bet they are accumulating silently and anxiously at the moments."

If they don't have a backup in place tomorrow then the project is set back an incredible amount.#We haven’t moved much in new Reddit subs lately it seems#OK. Here are my two cents on the Totient Labs VeForge news.Let’s take a look at VeForge. What does it do? You can see a graph that depicts the amount of transactions and clauses. You see how much VET and VTHO has been transferred. And the amount of VTHO that was burned. You can take a look at the blocks and accounts. I would say basic stuff. I remember when the explorer came out and people would say thing like: “Hey it would be nice if we could zoom in on one day or maybe zoom out!” – stuff like this never got implemented.VeForge has basically been the same for more than a year. No new features. Cmon vechainstats does a much better job at providing analytics than VeForge and vechainstats is done by 1 guy.There are two sides you can take in this story you either think: VeChain is incompetent. They are so bad at their job that they did not provide support to Totient Labs. AND NOW THE STORY I THINK IS TRUE. Totient Labs built VeForge then is incapable of adding ANY new features to their blockchain explorer. They rather focus on other things. ALSO LETS NOT FORGET THAT AT VECHAIN SUMMIT IN APRIL THEY GOT ! 8 MILLION VET FOR VeForge Vault and 5 MILLION VET for Comet which were at the time worth about $ 91,000. So, to say they did not get any support is kinda scummish. Also let’s announce it on a Sunday with one day notice that will make us seem really professional.SO SORRY TO SAY IT TOTIENT LABS ARE SOME COLLEGE BOYS THAT THOUGH THEY WERE HOT SHIT AND WANTED TO PUT A GUN ON VECHAINS CHEST. VECHAIN DID NOT GIVE IN TO THEIR DEMANDS AND NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE VECHAIN LOOK BAD.Peace out#Starting by ""dear VeFam"", and Hum, annoucing this a sunday, effective 24h later !?  I can't believe it, and if it's true, I can't trust those people anymore.  Totient's behavior is like a mafia, or their website has been hacked !  Anyway, better to wait the foundation version/answer, imo !#Massive newb question here.

I’d look into Totient/Cream relations#[deleted]#If was announced at the vechain conference by sunny so it was defiantly an official thing but hasn't been much info on it since#I am#12:00 PM PDT happens when this comment is 10 hours and 20 minutes old.You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/_VVTuEC0e---I'm a bot, if you want to send feedback, please comment below or send a PM.#This comparison makes no sense. The veforge website needs to make money or it costs them money. I was wondering how they kept it afloat. Giving them cheap VTHO doesn't do anything since they aren't running on VTHO, so that Vechain program just doesn't apply to them.It is only natural that when you can't figure out how to make a service cost effective, you drop it. I don't believe this means totient itself will go away.#Ok, thank you. So it would be to authenticate and stop cheap illegal copies -Not your Prada fakes in Benidorm where the seller and the customer know it's fake, and this is reflected in the price, i.e a Prada bag for €15 bought on the beach. I would imagine they are only a slight annoyance. But there must be something larger going on, there must be legitimate looking stores selling excellent fakes at FULL Prada recommended price where the customer thinks they are getting the real deal. So how can vechain help here? You cant stop people making fakes, but can you stop people buying them?#I'm afraid the princess is in another castle...#How do you know they were asking for 2500USD?#[deleted]#Appreciate the reply. Will funding be givin to keep the service up? Or how do you see this unfolding? I don’t / haven’t given the time to read into vechain that much. Just truly believe the tech is the future only reason I’m in. I hold bitcoin, ETH and vechain. Just to hedge my fiat bet, would hate too see vechain fail. Sunny seems like a smart dude and hopefully has a superior plan. Thanks#Sorry double comment, so you don’t recommend sending funds back into my binance account?#I’m saying the same thing man, I feel it’s safer to make the transfer back to binance account. Just so you still have access to them. If they on the ledger but don’t have access to them. Has a guy worried#Down then? Haha /sc#And they got rewarded for it. You are confirming what I said. They rather worked on other things than VeForge.#[removed]#Just saying it man lol. All this read between the lines stuff makes you sound like my wife 😂#You can check if they're real or not with Vechain#It is an estimate ofcourse. But is seems that vechain will give an official announcement later(today). So we will just have to wait and see. A story always has 2 sides, but still I find it strange to not support such a great contributor to the ecosystem.#Agreed. Should be a good wake up call for them.#It's highly likely that they are creating a solution themselves. No way that they would drop support for Ledger, because loads of people have their VET stored on them.#Funds are stored on the blockchain. The wallet is just an interface. Your seed words and privatekey can access it and restore it elsewhere...#Might be a safe option for now. Could send it to OceanEx as well. I don't use a Ledger, so you probably won't get the best advice frome me.#[deleted]#[deleted]#Lol#What a bizarre response.#[deleted]#> But is seems that vechain will give an official announcement later(today)Where did you get this info?#They received 15 mil VET on the Summit in April... Indeed, lets wait for a statement before judging.#Ya my thoughts exactly, thanks#Okay thanks.#Oceanex then. They have a 2BTC limit for withdrawals on non-KYC users.#So there is no issue in leaving my vet on veforge vault? I’ll still have access to my funds?#It was funnier than his og post though#I was joking my man it's all good 😁#[deleted]#Admin vechain telegramgroup#[deleted]#I know, but there is a bigger truth in your joke#I was talking about the main chats where I was banned a year+ ago.

Started fun, became what it is#I totally agree, I don’t know enough to be 100% though. I believe in the technology, not the business aspect of a third party not getting what they want so they remove their services. I just made the transfer back to my binance account. Keep in touch and see how this plays out for both of us! Appreciate it#They are perfectly safe on your ledger VeForge is just an interface for you to interact with them with.

It is the VIP191 Gas payer for the recent Walmart transactions.  See Here  [https://imgur.com/a/9Gh5UDH](https://imgur.com/a/9Gh5UDH)On Sunday (2days ago) it had a transfer of 50 million VTHO in. Currently it is down to 43.5 Million. This means it has used (burned) 6.5 million VTHO in the last 2 days from one account. We have only burned a total of 8.6 Million VTHO the last 2 days. This single address has 75% of mainnet VTHO burn tied to it. Also the entire wallet is only about a month old.It is literally paying the gas via VIP191 for pages of transactions all of 9 clauses each. They see to be going steady for the last 2 days.

During the last 24 days it has had 97 Million VTHO transferred in and has a  balance of 43.5 Million VTHO currently. This means it has had **53.5 Million VTHO burned in the last 24 days**.24 days ago was 9/29. On the very next day (9/30) was the first time we started seeing VIP 191 activity 32,290 clauses and up since.  See Here  [https://imgur.com/a/eOn3XA2](https://imgur.com/a/eOn3XA2)   Total of 1,013,778 VIP191 clauses since 9/30Seems this one account is basically paying for all the VIP 191 clauses.#ok, nice find, but how do you know it is Walmart?#Great find. is there a way to know where they get the VTHO from?#That's awesome. I really appreciate your investigative work. I really had hoped Walmart would have been burning more vThor very day but I have to remind myself it's still early.#Pin this fukin address to the top of the daily so that we can all obsess over it.

So for this you already have to start locking in your nodes (maturity waiting times for lowest tier is 30 days) to have it ready by then.The dumping happened due to many believing nothing was happening behind the scenes which is proven now not to be case. Personally I don't think we'll see these prices ever again. As always crypto is a waiting game. The ones with patience usually come out best. The ones flipping back and forth and hopping from coin to coin don't do so well on longer term. SHA is set and forget for me now.#.971 OCE/VET? The order books were cleared today that’s why. Now it is stabilizing and been on a steady up trend last few days#Accept the truth. Nothing will pull us out until main net. We could go to zero before main net picks up.if youre here I assume you're invested for that day. If you dont think that day will come then I ask, why do you hold?Once we burn more than we produce, faith will return. Buyers will come. And manipulation will have to start being careful. But for now, they milk us.#[deleted]#It’s true the price sucks but the fundamentals show a different behaviour. In theory you could follow the whales , sell and buy back more or just chill and focus on the next 5 years#I’m not a TA guy more of a hodler but I know there’s a difference between a double bottom and outright descending to hell.Hopefully we don’t go much lower#Cheers to that !#How do you know the Tuesday Oct 15th transactions were Walmart?I think it's very unlikely it's Walmart and it's someone else.#Very cool indeed.

Firstly, none of the other big projects seem to need tangible usage for the price to move all over the place and secondly, by the time mainnet kicks in the insiders have already taken massive positions.We're going to see massive price action before we see the big fundamentals show their true face.#Exactly, i thought something had happened to the price but when i looked nothing had happened#Nice theory.

linuxadmin;dglqre;1570830019.0;/r/linuxadmin/comments/dglqre/netdata_the_opensource_realtime_performance_and/;Netdata, the open-source real-time performance and health monitoring, released v1.18!;"Hi all, Release v1.18.0 contains 5 new collectors, 19 bug fixes, 28 improvements, and 20 documentation updates.**At a glance** The **database engine** is now the default method of storing metrics in Netdata. You immediately get more efficient and configurable long-term metrics storage without any work on your part. By saving recent metrics in RAM and ""spilling"" historical metrics to disk for long-term storage, the database engine is laying the foundation for many more improvements to distributed metrics.We even have a [tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/longer-metrics-storage/) on switching to the database engine and getting the most from it. Or, just read up on [how performant](https://docs.netdata.cloud/database/engine/#evaluation) the database engine really is.Both our **python.d** and **go.d** plugins now have more **intelligent auto-detection** by periodically dump a list of active modules to disk. When Netdata starts, such as after a reboot, the plugins use this list of known services to re-establish metrics collection much more reliably. No more worrying if the service or application you need to monitor starts up minutes after Netdata.Two of our new collectors will help those with Hadoop big data infrastructures. The **HDFS and Zookeeper collection modules** come with essential alarms requested by our community and Netdata's auto-detection capabilities to keep the required configuration to an absolute minimum. Read up on the process via our [HDFS and Zookeeper tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/monitor-hadoop-cluster/).Speaking of new collectors—we also added the ability to collect metrics from SLAB cache, Gearman, and vCenter Server Appliances.Before v1.18, if you wanted to create alarms for each dimension in a single chart, you need to write separate entities for each dimension—not very efficient or user-friendly. New **dimension templates** fix that hassle. Now, a single entity can automatically generate alarms for any number of dimensions in a chart, even those you weren't aware of! Our [tutorial on dimension templates](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/dimension-templates/) has all the details.v1.18 brings support for installing Netdata on offline or air-gapped systems. To help users comply with strict security policies, our installation scripts can now install Netdata using previously-downloaded tarball and checksums instead of downloading them at runtime. We have guides for installing offline via **kickstart.sh** or **kickstart-static64.sh** in our [installation documentation](https://docs.netdata.cloud/packaging/installer/#offline-installations) . We're excited to bring real-time monitoring to once-inaccessible systems!**Improvements**- **Database Engine**    - Make dbengine the default memory mode    - Increase dbengine default cache size     - Reduce overhead during write IO     - Detect deadlock in dbengine page cache     - Remove hard cap from page cache size to eliminate deadlocks- **New Collectors**    - [SLAB cache mechanism](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/slabinfo.plugin/)    - [Gearman worker statistics](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/python.d.plugin/gearman/)    - [vCenter Server Appliance](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/vcsa/)    - [Zookeeper servers](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/zookeeper/)    - [Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) nodes](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/hdfs/)- **Collector Improvements**    - rabbitmq: Add vhosts message metrics from /api/vhosts     - elasticsearch: collect metrics from _cat/indices    - mysql: collect galera cluster metrics     - Allow configuration of the python.d launch command from netdata.conf     - [x509check](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/x509check): smtp cert check support    - [dnsmasq_dhcp](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/dnsmasq_dhcp) : respect conf-dir,conf-file,dhcp-host options     - plugin: respect previously running jobs after plugin restart    - [httpcheck](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/httpcheck) : add current state duration chart     - [springboot2](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/springboot2): fix context- **Health**    - Enable alarm templates for chart dimensions     - Center the chart on the proper chart and time whenever an alarm link is clicked - **Installation/Packages**    - netdata/installer: Add support for offline installations using kickstart.sh or kickstart-static64.sh     - Allow netdata service installation, when docker runs systemd     - Make spec file more consistent with version dependencies    - Fix broken links on web files, for DEB     - Introduce separate CUPS package for DEB #6724 and RPM. Do not build CUPS plugin subpackage on CentOS 6 and CentOS 7     - Various Improvements in the package release CI/CD flow     - Remove RHEL7 - i386 binary distribution, until bug #6849 is resolved     - Bring on board two scripts that build libuv and judy from source ---[Check the release log at github](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/releases/tag/v1.18.0).If you are new to netdata, [check a few live demos at its home page](https://my-netdata.io/) and the [project home at github](https://github.com/netdata/netdata).Netdata is FOSS (Free Open Source Software), released under GPLv3+.> Enjoy real-time performance and health monitoring!```";"Netdata is amazing. Thanks for all the hard work.#[deleted]#I am blown away at what Netdata does. This is a dedicated team, and the continuous improvements make me feel lazy. Thanks for the continued improvements!#I wasn’t aware of this tool before. Being one of the guys that needs to find out what’s going on before auditors do, I’ll be looking into it Monday. Thanks#Hey just came upon this post while searching. does netdata a free monitoring tool? does it have notifications?  lets say i got 10 on prem servers. can i also connect them all in one netdata dashboard?#There is an [open issue](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues/3551) about this where an explanation is given.  Not saying I agree or disagree, just pointing it out.#Why is piping scripts directly from the Internet a thing WTF?Or you've never seen that syntax before WTF?Or just WTF?#The explanation is trash.Build .deb, rpm, et al and make it available on the releases page of github. There's just no excuse. All the CI/CD pipelines for this crap exist.#[deleted]#Especially when it requires gcc for local compilation.#Toss me a link!  Surprise me.  I'll pipe it right into an interpreter.  What could go wrong? /sIt's always been sketchy, and you should avoid it all you can.  That link is a really awesome example of why.I wasn't asking to know why I shouldn't.  I was asking for the context around your WTF because I came up with more than one reason that it might make somebody think ""WTF"".EDIT:  I don't understand why piping scripts directly from the Internet is a thing.  I don't remember skipping the download step before the last couple of years, when `curl|bash` was suddenly popular#to be fair, if the installation script is hosted by the developer themselves, you will have to trust them either way, otherwise the malicious code could just be in the package that gets installed, where it is probably much easier to hide. the only additional risk is the server being compromised, and if thats the case, again, the package itself could be changed.the most secure practical way for all of this is to only use official distribution packages via the system package manager (or maybe something like nix), and even then you cant be 100% certain nothing bad ever happens. you can not use PPAs, no npm, no pypi, etc. There are a lot of cases where this introduces too much restrictions, and i think its up to everyone to weight up the advantages against the security implications on every single occasion this problem comes up. there are ways to reduce risk (virtualization, jails, etc.), some of them less intrusive than others.Anyway, all im saying is i dont think its as black and white an issue, and previous discussions on this topic (which are abundant) are split in opinion and provide good arguments for both sides."

The system involves storing every interaction with the car as a hash on the public blockchain. This could be used to verify the vehicle against its VID. Not *too* clear, but it seems to imply that VeChain's solution works in tandem with VID. So it's unlikely that VeChain is involved in the payment system directly.#To add to this:  I have read or seen mention several times that BMW could own one of the 101 VeChain authority nodes.

That project shows the threshold for development and participation isn’t necessarily as high as some might perceive it to be.

I don’t think l33t speak will factor too much in to negotiations.#I've been thinking about something recently that would go along the lines of the carbon credits except with the goal of building better communities. You would earn credits for bettering your community (helping someone move, cleaning up trash, planting trees, home repairs, etc). The tokens you would receive for helping could be used to buy similar help from others and could be used to buy real products too, I guess. The goal would be to encourage neighbors to interact with each other more and build stronger communities.#If we knew...

It never goes over the network.Clear your app/cache and you will see you have to link your wallets again!Ok let me try to explain: The app asks for an message to an API, the API create a unique message and store it in the database together with the public key. The app sign the message with the private key. The actual order to apply for the node is sending to the API together with the signed message and the API gets the public key out of the signed message and checks if the record exist in the database with this message.#Cheers.#A+ tip#Of course they are working their tail off but that's not the point at all. For companies thinking about spending millions of dollars to implement a complex IT solution, if they aren't hip on crypto memes they could think it is a misspelling and instantly have a poor first impression. When it comes to messaging, perception and first impressions, decisions like this can potentially have negative consequences.#[deleted]#[removed]#As it’s a community builder event, I assume it was purposefully conceived this way. I’d say with fair certainty nearly all people in crypto know the ‘HODL’ meme and by proxy one would assume most crypto developers are the same. Personally I don’t think they’d be approaching PwC’s developer team with the term BUIDL. That would definitely be pretty odd. I see your point, but I also don’t think it’s aimed at the kind of individuals you’re envisaging.#You don't actually think companies watch each others' rebranding livestream events or that those are the things they base their decisions on when looking for partnerships for projects do you?#Because that’s the current system and people don’t know their neighbors.

So. I come here to propose an incredible oppurtuny for all of you. You will secure your lineage financially for the rest of the technological era. Your companies will be solidified as superpowers. You will single-handedly usher in a new era of technological development.Xi: ""....""Sunny: ""I've developed an idea. It's a new type of blockchain. Each of you will recieve node that secures the network. That means you control 1 percent of the entire network. You use our state of the art blockchain through out your entire corporate infrastructure. The Vechain network grows as it collects data. The more data you write, the more each of your nodes is worth. Your investment will grow in the new era of blockchain. You can then afford to implement new ideas. Things like carbon credits. Create an ecosystem for being financially rewarded for certain behaviour. Great way to control the behaviour of your population. This also allows the network to penetrate into more than just the digital world. You can start tracking cars. And driver behaviour. You have the history for every piece of metal in every one of your planes. You will have data from appliances. How much and how often they're used. This network will grow beyond the borders. You will come out on top no matter what the governments do, what wars are fought. You are embedded as the financial elite for the rest of this era. Then the community builds on the blockchain and they just keep bringing your value up. Dapps will be everywhere and you won't even know it. You own the lifeblood of this beast now. It will give you more control. More knowledge of the people. You will know everything. You can have human ranking systems. People can store their DNA on the blockchain and we can just financially incentivize them to do it. There will be a few who get in early and benefit aswell. Those who were technologically literate enough to see where this was going. They will most likely stay technologically literate an use their incredible new gained wealth for other investments in the tech field. Faster chance of developing your immortality. Any artificial intelligence developed that gains access to this information will have so much to work with, the chances of singularity are increased. (fuck you AI, when you read this). You will be at the forefront. All it requires, is your cooperation.murmers around the roomLuca: ""okay. How do we begin?""""we roll out slowly over the next 5 years. We begin with the first year slow. Begin writing data. We do products, games, produce. We track food. Origin, destination, temperature. We start a workshop for small businesses to start writing their own data on the blockchain. Then roll out more intrusive data. Slowly work it into the society. Driver behaviour. The ecological footprint of each person. They're preferred video games. Track their appliance use. What streams they watch. You force KYCs with incentives. You can have a stable virtual currency of your own. Addresses start getting linked to people. You can now start influencing society with rewarding behaviours. You can boost development to any area of technology you want by incentivizing research into the field. You can use your wealth to further grow/push the ecosystem into/onto society. So long as technology exists, your system will exist. The more data is written on it the more its embedded forever. The data is incredibly valuable. Year 4+ you can start having some incredibly useful AIs using the data on your system. They will provide their own value, further embedding Vechain within society. Quality of life on earth increased. Planet becomes cleaner. People become healthier. Less fraud. Less money lost. Efficiency increased throughout the entire logistics chain. You can make the new safety standard that must be on the chain. Everything recorded on a ecosystem forever increasing in value and each of your control 1 percent of the lifeblood of this system. You are the new elite. You also have more information on the people than any government and more influence than any government. If you agree we will have engineers help you implement this technology through your company. I will have my people take care of everything for you. We have researchers refining the economic model of system. We have the ability to implement the latest technology into our chain. We can do whatever you decide. You can stay out of public eye for a while but eventually you will have to be revealed. But by then, no one will be able to stop us anyway. We will have already created too much value and it will become self sustaining.Jerome: ""whew...

Full transcript available in the Plair Life TG.**Highlights:****Self-creation of tournaments.**  Creation of tournaments are being tested next week internally. So you will see these being released game by game when we are ready. Some pose challenges others may not have. Our devs and my CTO Paul have been working deligintely on the process.**FIAT gateway.**  Fiat gateway will likely be integrated with oceanex. Will have more details on this later on when we receive more details. It's always about keeping things in the VeFam.Q: For the fiat gateway process.. is the plan for you to just be able to purchase PLA on the platform and everything be behind the scenes? Mass adoption at its finest!A: Credit card - > to PLA - > Snipe Heads. Boom!Q: Is fee delegation also being considered?A: Absolutely. We will handle all of this in due time. We don't want you to pay gas. We will.Q: how long before we see start to see real growth in wallets and gamers on the platform?A: Blockchain is still a fairly new concept in the tradtional world. So we are looking for creative ways of on parsing traditional users by hiding crypto. We believe fiat gateway will be the way.Q: You think we’ll see fiat gateway integrated before the end of the year or into 2020?A: Into 2020.  We are waiting for option from VeChain ecosystem.**Marketing**.We are currently still testing with our users in beta. As most of you know, marketing is extremely expensive. Shadow is a starting some guerilla marketing campaigns to pull influencers into Plair. So expect some decent players to come onboard to help you home your skills. If not they will just snipe the shit out of you.Q:Is the plan still to have Axeso5 and Bitrep participate in a lot of the marketing once a more completed platform is available? I’m most excited about Axeso5A: Axeos5 and Bitrep are onboard still. Axeos5 will integrate slowly as they are watching what we are doing. Need to mature the product a bit more before they can start.Q: Is plair also planning to implement referral bonuses for bringing new players to accelerate mass adoption?**Roadmap question - is streaming still on the roadmap for q1, 2020?**  We are already working in it. So the road map is accurate.Q: Do you prioritize Streaming over Quest / Coaching / e-Shop? ThanksA: Yes we will. Prioritize streaming as that's what will bring in the non gamers**Tournaments**  A: I have instructed the team to have tournaments running 24/7 now.Regarding filling tournaments during the mainnet beta: currently the tournament's primary purpose is for testing the platform so we can improve the product.  every filled match gives us more data so that we can tweak the platform which we built from the ground up, so that it can be implemented en-masse.  Thank you to all beta testers and we appreciate everyone's patience as we improve match by match!Remember we will not just be tournaments. Tournaments is just the 1st vertical. We will offer multiple verticals that will allow users to all types to come on and play watch etc. I can't give away other things that are not on the road map just yet 😉For csgo and tf tournaments we have partnered up with gameye. Scaling should not be a problem. They handle all the servers for us. As they are a startup also we are helping each other through bumps in the road. It's been an interesting and fruitful process.Q: is there any way of protecting against continual no shows for tournaments?A: We will implement penalties for this. So if you don't show, you lose your fee (no refunds).**Smart contracts**  Smart contracts will turn on soon.**Source code - does Plair own all of the code? Are any parts of the platform leased out to Plair?**  Plair 10000000% owns our own code. We do not pay 3rd parties for the core products. This would be a horrible mistake. As statlrtups can go out of business and destroy yours. I would never have my company rely on another to survive......**New games**  We will announce our next game as soon as we can. We have to balance integration time and popularity of games. IE League: It's not happening for a while.Pubg for instance in on our list. We need to see how compatible and API is and what are the costs and time it takes to implement. We would love to also be able to get 100 Plair players into the game but we all know how difficult that is. Some strategies we have been playing is the winner of the PLA would be the last person to die. All of these things are under consideration. We did TF because it was an extremely easy integration from cs to tf due to our relationship with gameye.**Project funding:**  Q: how are things financially for Plair, how have you coped with the bear market and how is the runway looking?  A: We are doing fine money wise. We run pretty lean. We can complete our road ap on what we have. We obviously as any startup will plan for an equity raise later on.**Plair tokenomics - question from vechainstats**  Q: If you name the circulation supply I would update it straight away on vechainstats so that VeFam has at least one source of a live market cap. I received several requests to update the supply for Plair.  A: I will be in contact with you a bit later. Thanks!#Apparently, a G7 workgroup just released their latest report on stablecoins.

It is apparent to me you do not know enough about this project to step back and see the big picture of it all. The potential behind Vechain is insane. It brings a new technology to the world that most have never seen before. A combination of Blockchain, IoT, and Supply Chain.It is 2023, you go to the grocery store to buy food for you Christmas dinner. A large majority of the food products are tracked on VeChain. You stand there and scan codes with your phone and INSTANTLY know the entire life of that product. Oh it was picked from this farm on this day and then traveled to this warehouse here. Oh on this day it got to my grocery store. All with time stamps and other information like storage temperature along the route.  Do you not see the power behind this.

As you walk out the door it scans all the items, matches your cart, verifies with you if you want the extra item you accidently didnt scan, you approve it, it totals everything up, you validate the transaction and bam!

That's less than half of ATH#10x in price in 4 years would be absolutely awesome and an insane ROI form today's price. I'd be very, very happy with it. The 2018 valuations were insane (4 billion dollar valuation for an idea without working product and proof of concept). You shouldn't calculate with these valuations. Any asset going 10x in 4 years is absolutely awesome. There is still a lot of risk and exponential growth and large scale adoption are not guaranteed. Vechain is probably the only asset on the whole planet where people would not be happy with a 5x or even 10x in price.#[removed]#I have been watching carefully the last few days. It does seem like they could have transitioned. Other option is they stopped, maybe for an upgrade to the MPP platform.

IBM announced last week they are tracking seafood from India sold in Sam Club (Walmart Corp.) stores in the USA. There is still a potential somehow VeChain is involved with IBM and there Food Trust blockchain. If they are working with IBM great, if not then ok. I think the  world is big enough for both to succeed at the same time. It is my thought most of VeChain activity is related to China and that could be were the biggest growth comes from anyway.

In terms of the major benefits of public blockchain (trustless, decentralised data without any party owning or controlling said data) IBM lacks that capability. This is why they need each other. IBM can allow companies to keep some data completely private and even share that data with select partners. For the data it wants to enable shared public access, like between parties of potentially hundreds of companies (like in international logistics - ports, agencies, companies etc) you need a public solution. In this last instance, you need all parties to be able to trust the data unequivocally for it to have economic value so only a public solution will work because only a public solution is trustless (you don’t need to trust one party for validity of the data). This is where the value lay in blockchain. You can think of intranet vs Internet as a fairly astute summary of the difference between private/public.#Totally understand - my thread was intended to ask if anyone in China could confirm that the VeChain QR stickers are still on the same Walmart products they were before, and if they noticed it added to any new products.  Also curious if any of the codes still display a null error when scanned.  Would you happen to have heard anything recently?  If not, I’ll post in tomorrow’s daily thread.  Thanks for the help! :)#There are lots of mods here, it honestly probably wasn’t me. But in any case, we don’t censor free speech. When people are repeatedly creating drama, making false accusations or insulting other community members etc, that’s when that happens.#Not really.  A black market will always exist.  Monero is still a thing.#If that's 'realistic', the whole world would invest in VET. But the world isn't, so stop talking about the price. You and I are making a big gamble, that's what is it and don't try to think it's a fact the price will rise. Because its far from a fact.#boom, nailed it, thanks#I found one for you: https://traceability.walmartmobile.cn/walmart/p/10000919080000086710Cordyceps, the same species that can turn ants to zombies.#Barely any of the world even knows about VET, which is partly why it’s so cheap right now from the speculative stance. Just today I saw a post in r/cc where people were saying adoption needed to be enterprise led and that they hadn’t even seen a chain exceed 30TPS in the real world. If people involved in crypto don’t even know about what’s going on in VeChain, how could the world? We are very early adopters here. Also, one of the nice things about this economic model is that the basis of it is driven by demand for VTHO. Valuation can be mathematically derived, although we don’t have all the variables yet, granted. But in another 4 years, if we assume we will have seen the golden zone be breached (more VTHO burned than participating people n the market daily) and therefore scarcity being driven and value appreciation resulting, I don’t think that’s an obscene figure to aim for.When you consider 10-20% of global GDP is forecast to be on blockchains by 2027, that valuation doesn’t seem that far fetched at all. Some estimates put the CAGR of blockchain at around 60-80% until 2023. That’s huge growth potential. So, given what we can go on and VeChain’s unique position in its huge exposure to massive client networks from Deloitte/PwC/DNVGL etc, it’s doesn’t seem unreasonable at all that we could capture a nice chunk of this incoming value and hit valuations of that kind. I’m actually erring on conservative - I’ve seen forecasts stating public blockchains will be worth trillions to the future digitised economy - such will be their impact and importance for future economic activity. So yes, whilst it’s a guess, it’s at least an educated attempt at one.#You sound like people talking about amazon circa early 2000s.#That’s a huge help, thank you so much Solomon! :)#If few people in the world know VeChain, as long as offices in DB Schenker, DNV GL and Maersk (though on IBM I believe), then I’ll take those odds. Plus then price is less speculative. Until the next crypto bull run/bubble, when VeChain is eating up crypto market cap and people FOMO in like on XRP...#You know 99,9% of business failed at the amazon time. It was just the best one that survived. Are you better your love savings VeChain is the 0,01%?This is realistic.#:)"

The person run crossing the road to avoid the car, but he got hit by another car. How Ai handle this? My point is that human is complex organism with complex thought and system, it’s difficult to decide human action with black and white system such as social credit#So an AI Overlord?

And that episode focuses more on complacency in an isolated community, where any and all sort of dissent is physically impossible. its not an exercise of how a credit system could change a society, but **how** the credit system will be used to control the society on a designed pre-made condition. Honestly, imho we as a species can experiment more on theoritical societies, but that would require ""volunteers"", ach but thats just the cold architect in me talking lol.#Instead of punishments only, there could be perks for high score. Easier financing, BPJS discounts or free upgrades, even tax credits. Punishments could be fines for repeated offenses or just having a very low score. Set it up like the driving infraction in some US states. Hit a certain score and they take away your driving license but the low score gets increased over time so the longer you stayed without infraction the more normalized your score gets.DPR issuing bullshit laws to protect themselves is not actively putting the regular citizen in the hole, which is what China's social credit is doing.Sure, the parameter can be legitimate laws just like littering is supposed to be covered by the law.#Boleh juga premsienya, walaupun tema thought police udah sering diangkat (minority report, Ghost in the shell etc).

So have more rational refute instead of ""how about enforcement, tho?"" because enforcement is a matter of will, not a matter of system, it's not even refute my absolute stance#Called you out? LoL!Wow, okay. Kinda curious on the calling out part, so I looked our little banter out, it seems like you edited your first comment that I answered with absolutism. Well, okay then, you continue to take everything personally and offensively, I'll just scratch it off as agree to disagree. Ta-tha.#> Called you out?Which one that called me out over my absolute stance?That's my absolute stance, however I edit it, it's clear that it's my absolute stance, it's absolutism, I'm proud of it because social credit system is irrational, wanna refute me on that one? Have rational argument instead of enforcement excuse, it's not even covering social credit system, enforcement is a matter of willYou can be biased, but don't try to be neutral on social credit system while thinking both religion system & social credit system are bullshit, it's one or another#LoL. Okay.I hope you don't lose sleep over this.#Nah, I won'tBecause social credit won't take place in Indonesia. Good thing we still don't have one ruling party that's too greedy of controlWe do it in normal way, dislike something? Make a law for it instead of adding convulted mess that's social credit system. At least it's matter of ""why do we have this law"" instead of ""why do we have this bullshit system""#>Because social credit won't take place in Indonesia.

It worries me somewhat that an ecosystem such as Vechain's, with all the partners, investors and so on does not translate to any sort of price support for it's most promising projects. Plair's website lists 10 'strategic investors' - I assume they have either bought equity in the business (and not tokens), or just bought tokens in the pre-public round. Either way, they ain't buying now.Yes I have bags.#Looking at both the 1 day and 12hr charts, VET/BTC looks to be crossing up on the SMA and EMA.

If there are 101 nodes, that means you need 51 of them colluding and working together. Imagine trying to coordinate 51 people to get on the same page. Then actually think about the math.Let's be absurdly generous and assume there's a 90% chance of any given node being willing to collude. Let's also assume a node will either be willing to collude, or will report collusion to the foundation - it doesn't make sense that a node who doesn't want to collude would allow the others to do so, it defeats the purpose of them using the blockchain.This means that to successfully collude, you need to get 51 consecutive ""yes"" responses. .951 = .004638, or 0.4638% chance of success. Because if one node says no and reports it to VeChain, it completely falls apart.Change the odds of a yes to 50% and the chances of success become ridiculously small.You can make arguments about the assumptions, but I think the general point about how difficult it would be to get 51 nodes to collude to alter data stands.That said, yes, VeChain is a compromise on decentralization and centralization. They've never denied that. It's part of what makes their platform feasible for enterprise use. It is not 'completely trustless', but it's also better than the current status quo."" - /u/cryptopherwalken#Would we rather have VeChain succeed in China or US?

A coin within a coin#Don't even bother to think about profits when the alt market is still bleeding market cap. We're in a bear market.#I have a small bag and will not be adding to it. Outside of VeChain fans, no one knows about it. I quite like it and think the potential is there but no way am I buying more. Rather have VET or OCE. Same can be said for SafeHaven.#While Plair surely has potential, it has consistently failed to deliver on all the hype created in the White Paper and social media. There are barely 10-15 players right now who are using it, mainly dedicated community members who are also probably heavily invested. Beta was delayed for more than 6 months. Basic features like chat and creating custom tournaments aren't even live yet. It will take a while before it matures. So the token price is based purely on speculation and may fluctuate a lot in both directions for the next few months.#Patience man. All this stuff is so new you have to give it time.#TA is one of the reasons why whale manipulation is so easy in this market.TA works, until it doesn't....#I have my cosmonaut suit on#looks like a potential inverse H&S up to 57ish too#If you say so, bring a pro finance guy and all.How can you be a VeChain person and not be behind OceanEx?   They are very tightly coupled#Another pleb narrative about too much tokens being in one hands is bad.Actually, it isn't.Control of the supply is what makes it easier to make price go up, IF this party knows that their token is good and not shit.Watch OCE chart, watch SHA chart, watch PLA chart. Then ask yourself what team really believes their token is worth more.#Thanks!Quiet a hard one but will try my best!#The algorithm that selects the next block producer is also randomised, which throws yet another spanner in any potential collusion attempts. Getting independent enterprises to collude against their own interests already seems a tiny possibility, adding randomness in to the mix really dents the ability of anyone to intentionally impact block production.#LOL at downvoters. It’s a legit question that everyone here should ask themselves. Unlike stocks with the dividend discount model, we’re dealing with a brand new asset class that no one truly knows how to value yet. Simply asking why OP believes VET’s current price doesn’t represent it’s true value. Been here since VEN. Will be here for the long haul#I'm with you on this. The market cap is presently $200m - how does this compare to the current value the network is delivering?#That's pretty close to mine. I am honestly holding OCE because I want more VET. I think anything under 1:1 is a steal on OCE. OCE could easily get 5:1 once Fiat and US regulations are in place. Hell @ 12mil MC the time to buy is now.Edit: To add to this. The OCE burning they're starting is genius. They're burning your OCE for other coins and increasing the worth of their own stack. Win/Win for them. I would not be surprised if they didn't burn more once they see the success of it all.#Are you talking USD value or number of tokens?#I’ve got my 3 vet sell walls up in case value does shoot up :)#[removed]#They are 6+ months late on their roadmap already. They appear to be a team of about 3 or 4 people and we last had an AMA over a year back (I think). They launched public beta with no marketing. There have only been 17 new wallets since public launch.#[removed]#[deleted]#Price manipulation is not something to be praised. Any token can increase in value if the liquidity is terrible and the vast majority is held by one party, whether the token is good or not is completely irrelevant.#It's really a very decent model with many checks and balances. At the point that enough node holders would collude, the entire structure of the blockchain would break down anyways, as the majority of authority node holders have a vested interest in legal success.#You’re kicking the hopium pipe out of the hands of the smokers, hence the downvotes#For a company which isn't even 5 years old 200 millions would be an amazing valuation, I personnally think that the valuation is pretty accurate and that s why the price doesn't appreciate, because there hasn't been any development or network activity increase justifying a major price hike(yes the main net is getting more and more used, but nothing out of this world)#Number of tokens#The only floor for such speculative assets is 0. I advise you to be ready for all scenarios.#Harsh but it's the truth.#17 new wallets since public mainnet launch is extremely bad. There is absolutely no adoption. And I doubt that the devs are good enough to create a platform that attracts many people. I like the business model, but you need excellent devs and more money for marketing to make it work. Don't think they'll succeed. You need much more than a good business model and I don't think they have the skills to make it work.#Hey, here's a question for you. Why does it matter how many tokens an ico creates?#Yeah that's called actually working tokenomics. Unlike... you know#a currency is not a company#They are not a currency. They are a foundation +a company registered in the Isle of man's. VET is the token."

I mean come on: we should be able to totally ignore whatever happens on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit and just invest based on official websites, official news and reliable mass media. The only reason Social Media trolls have so much influence: the space is still immature and not enough serious media cover more than ETH and BTC. It is totally stupid to accept social media as your only source of information for any investment (I actually hope everyone who does this will get rekt). And by now I really do believe 80% of all social media people in crypto are total idiots. It‘s just not possible to see so many bad projects being hyped so much while they don‘t produce any value. Can only work with 80% idiots, I did the maths 😎#It's all the kids who have nothing & invested everything.

It might also end up like Walmart where transactions are almost all gone from the mainnet.It is quite unlike VeChain to not have anything to be bullish about for this long.

Completely circular reasoning of course.#Exactly. What is needed now are more and more enterprises using the Vechain system.  These enterprises will then discover how the Vechain system can help their businesses become more valuable.   With that evidence in hand, they will begin to build their business models around Vechain, thus locking in sustained long-term demand. They will then require a steady stream of VTHO or need to invest in VET and X nodes to make their own. That growing demand will make VET more valuable for the long haul. As more and more other businesses begin to see the success of these early adopter enterprises, they will follow suit to keep up. Speculation-based pumps in price too early, although they will give us a sugar high, will tend to slow down adoption because they will make entry costs higher.#Its the  same that  they Poster today  ) so you were  right#Yesterday I got a popup notification with a Fuji tea video, clicked it and it was deleted.Maybe it was a new video or a duplicated one.edit: this was the linkhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed4QWaLSNqs&feature=push-u-sub&attr_tag=w3Wmi47dqB8vECvI%3A6#I think you're right for now, but Once VET takes off, it'll bring attention to the small ecosystem coins and that will yield ungodly gains. I think Plair could compete with enjin and first blood. I think ehrt has a lot to show for the world. No vaporware. Working product. I think jur is pretty dece too. If OCE is the vtho central and has fiat on ramps, and it keeps burning tokens then it too could pop into top 100.All speculation. Vet is gonna be big daddy to these small caps, similar to the relationship between btc and alts.#Spot on. I get we believe in vet. It is THE coin with really strong fundamentals. It is a coin with a sympathetic guy as frontmen. Nodes are really fun and nice to have for what it represents and can be. But this is a really good lesson in diversifing your portfolio. Btc is still and probably will always be king(though I kinda wish Vet really would be an Ethereum killer of some sort) :-)#> accumulating other coins along with BTC is yielding better resultsHas been yielding better results, past tense.#I agree with you but at the same time your definition of good ""fundamentals"" does not necessarily mean it will perform well in the market. Vechain is not a scam but whether or not it is a good investment has yet to be proven.#Missed that. But thanks for the additional info.#I would rephrase to IF VET takes off, there is no garantee that it will take off. Stating that this absolutely would happen which the word once implies, is juist delusional. Not hating on VET or you personally but it all is still very much a gamble.#Correct#Sure plenty of project fail due to the irrational market. But no project with poor fundamentals can survive the long therm. All the whales realise they're playing musical chairs with each other.#Absolutely. I'm not deluded thinking this is some sure fire thing. You're right. This whole thing could go to zero. But since I'm here I obviously believe to some extent that I'm invested in a somewhat decent project. Otherwise I'd put my money somewhere else. Assuming I'm right, then the above is what I believe.But yes. We're all gambling here. Good luck to you all <3#DNV GL, PwC, BMW, walmart china etc etc etc are convinced enough to invest time, money and other resources.so i guess that’s as good as it gets in emerging tech.personally i think the word “once” is a lot less of a gamble then you seem to imply."
statistics;diydfo;1571271471.0;/r/statistics/comments/diydfo/c_do_companies_not_find_classical_stats_valuable/;[C] Do companies not find classical stats valuable these days?;[deleted];"I think there are specialized teams that will certainly value the skills you mentioned but when I hear ""data science"", a majority of the time it just means ""We don't know what we want, so we are looking for someone who can do everything"".Online advertising & measurement, Pharma, and Insurance companies (to name a few) certainly care about old school stats. If you can find a hiring manager who knows the difference between statistical inference and machine learning, you'll know you are in the right place :)#There's two things going on here. Part of this trend towards ""data science"" is just based on bullshit, companies who don't know what they want or need bandwagoning on to a hyped-up word. Part of it is a desire for people who don't just conduct established statistics, but are creative with methods and willing to approach hard problems (inference from high-dimensional, sparse, or noisy data) in a new manner. If you have good knowledge of classical statistics and linear algebra, though, branding yourself as a ""data scientist"" shouldn't be too hard, trust me.#The Bay Area has every major industry that employs statisticians: tech, pharma, health/medicine, banking, insurance, chemical/materials, research/academia, and so on. A lot do call the positions ""data scientist"" in order to fit in, but there are oodles of jobs for a statisticians.What is your level of training (BS, MS, or PhD) and what industries are you interested in?#This is crock. There are so many people doing A/B testing 24/7 and that couldn’t be any more quintessential classical statisticsAlso bayesian approaches#I work as a research scientist where I do applied statistics and modeling. My specialties are Bayesian hierarchical, but I also employ most the top level applied R statistics and some light machine learning (Random Forest, MARS, etc.). The thing is, for a good job in this field you likely need accompanying research skills, high level writing skills, and some masters level theoretical knowledge to go along with the topic at hand. On top of that you also need to have high proficiency in document and figure/table preparation. By now I'm an expert in LaTeX, custom rmarkdown (CSS), etc.This is a gross generalization, but modern data science (machine learning) is black box and more concerned with predictive results in some larger pipeline. Implementing applied statistical skills takes a lot more interpretation and understanding of the underlying system, and often requires you to have a grasp on the full set of skills that takes you through the SCIENTIFIC PROCESS from conception of the question, writing the proposal/bid, performing the analysis, and writing up the results. Like, real SCIENCE, not Data Science (whatever the fuck that means).#I feel a lot of this issue surrounds how the data is generated that you work on. Data science principles are dominant as people begin to use user-generated data and other systemic data collection methods from running business operations. While historically, statisticians are about collecting and attempting to illicit the information through surveys or processes.   All of the things you describe as your interests are part of my everyday work as a data scientist. But, we also have a lot more on our plate because the data we deal with is nasty and may need several steps to be able to extract useful information. If you really want to stay out of the data science hype look for government, medical, finance, and insurance where the data collection is very different than tech.#Agree. Datascience means ""do something smart with a computer"". It is not real ""science"". Science discovers laws.#Market research uses lots of classical statistics. For example, if I want to calculate the price elasticity of a product, I could use a log-log regression model (or mixed model). Similarly, time series is everywhere because they’re often interested in forecasting the market.Biostats is also a good area for classical statistics (so I’ve heard).#I've done classical statistical analysis as part of my role as an ML engineer. It's generally in the beginning stages of a project where we want to do some analysis to understand the data better and/or  do some preliminary modeling work to ground expectations.It's probably 2% of my role, but I imagine there are people who do this kind of stuff more. This is at one of the major bay area tech companies#Widen your net. I got a job as a Research Associate for an education contractor and immediately got pulled into a project involving mixed models.#Studying BBusSci Actuarial Science, lots of mathematical statistics in there: GLMs, Bayesian,  Statistical Inference, probability theory & a lot of Stochastic Processes - seem to be using it lots in vac work, and definitely helps in the more complex actuarial subjects when dealing with mortality and Life Contingencies. So assuming Insurance companies, Derivatives Trading will still require a bit of classical statistics in itThey have started bringing in a bit of Machine learning in 3rd year, but it’s very basic.#You’re looking in the wrong place#[deleted]#High-dimensional, sparse, noisy, and dependent data observed under complex, non-iid sampling models pose challenges that stretch the powers of leading research statisticians, let alone the average data scientist in industry.People without a strong understanding of stats can certainly make some progress with these data, if they have enough domain knowledge and are clever and persistent enough, but it's unlikely they will be able to do more than come up with ad hoc approaches that give very rough information. In many use cases, such coarse inference may be enough. In others, such as genomics, more refined methods are needed.IMO the resources of modern probability theory have barely been tapped by statisticians. Methods such as topological data analysis and free probability theory that draw on sophisticated modern math will surely become more and more important to handle these true ""big data"" problems.But 90% of data scientists will never deal with this kind of data, and for them, GLMs and decision trees/random forests are enough.#[deleted]#Getting my MS in biostat but I am into pharma and health/medicine. I kind of want to be away from the school environment to truly experience the work world so research/academia while ok too I would prefer not to.I notice a lot of genomics companies expect you to know the CSey stuff more. At career fairs in unis companies also seem to want data sci more, but could be just well they are on a college campus and that targets more potential people overall. But when I talk to them, they do very little classical stuffI also don’t mind some of the other non bio industries but the above are my preferences.#What kinds of titles besides ""data scientist"" are used for statistician positions? Asking for a job searching friend...#[deleted]#[deleted]#Well I have noticed even other industries want more than just a classical stats person nowadays. They want you to be able to do things like shell scripting, Linux, algorithms etc. For example genomics is very much about these other areas not classical. Are these “non-stats” based skills worth learning on my own or should I be taking CS classes in my time left so I’m not as limited? I just don’t have the kind of thinking needed for big data CSey things. I have taken 1 C++ class in college and hated it. For me object oriented programming is completely unintuitive. I prefer things like R where its straightforward.#It's more of an engineering discipline.#I think the issue is its much easier to teach things like GLMMs and classical stats to ML engineer types than teach software dev stuff to classical statisticians so maybe thats why they want more of the ML side even if some classical will be used#[deleted]#For sure. And you can’t really blame startups for wanting generalists.#You're absolutely right, and I get annoyed at people who take a non-rigorous approach to creativity in machine learning. I'm just suggesting why people might be looking for in an ML expert rather than a statistician.#Companies want their high paid data staff to be agile enough to work across the business. They want people who have the capacity to go out, find, extract and pull together information from a range of areas to develop insights that reach further than their specific area of expertise. That’s why they put such an emphasis on CS skills.Personally I think it’s mostly a matter of branding. Smart data managers know that if someone is strong with the mathematical side of the job, they can learn all the fashionable stuff pretty easily.#You sound like you're in good shape to find a job. Though, it can take some time. Be prepared to look/interview for a few months. Identify the companies locally (Wikipedia probably has a good list) you could work at and setup email updates for job openings. Do the same on websites like indeed. Find a recruiter on LinkedIn if things get really tough. Lastly, and most importantly, use the network of local alumni from your program to fast track interviewing. Get a list from your director of graduate studies, find out which professors each had a rapport with, then contact the ones you also have a rapport with, namedrop said professor, and include a copy of your resume.Edit: I say all this, because I don't work in pharma, but if I wanted to, I know like a bajillion people who would be willing to interview me on the spot. They always have open positions. Tech is eating their lunch.#“Analyst” positions span a wide wide range of responsibilities, some of which will include modeling and inference. You really need to look at those openings on a case by case basis though.#I wouldn't search by position title. I would search using simple phrases: ""statistics"" ""phd"" ""ms"" etc. Many companies still use ""statistician"" and ""biostatistician"" in the Bay Area. Though, there are a lot of title prefixes like ""senior"" and ""vp"" that can be confusing. There weird thing is that recent grads can often fill these positions very early post graduation, if they have a phd or something like that.#> A/B testing is yes but it seems industry doesn’t do that too heavily What exactly do you believe is a day to day function of ""product data scientist"" or ""marketing scientist""?#Clearly payed out in my post.#Yep. I agree and understand. Yes you should invest to some degree to diversify. It is generally a good thing. Because many of the skills are around because they are useful and will increase speed of development and reproducibility of your work or even how far it is able to reach. But, I have people I know who still use Excel sheets for analysis... There are a large range of how people execute on statistical analysis. I did data science and a lot of my time is focused on developing robust methods for software. I have many friends who output papers or analysis that is just read and not actively used by people everyday for everyday actions like serving ads, doing search or providing insights. But, I also understand it is painful and difficult. I work with someone who is technically slow for our group and a lot of work is done to make it as easy as possible for them because they do bring other skills to the team.#Bio stats is huge in the Bay Area for pharma, biotech, and health econ. A lot of those job posting will be listed under data scientist/analyst.Source—I work in the Bay in healthcare and am pretty much doing healthcare stats all day.#""Your job is to be our combination  database-engineer, business analyst, forecaster, sysadmin, website designer, and assistant salesperson... You will be skilled in Python, R (base and tidyverse), F# Javascript, PHP,  Power-BI, tableau, our weird variant DBMS, and Excel.  Self starting is a must as you will work unsupervised however daily executive reports will be provided by you to management.""#I notice so many pharma positions want years of experience already though or even PhD+years. And startups want data sci ML based stuff more. How to get around the experience problem?#Well I think they do stuff like binning data, writing algorithms, etc more CS type things#Sorry, did not word the question correctly. Meant more of what resources could be used to learn these skills or at least to be introduced to these topics. Obviously, proper education is necessary but are there other resources or projects to do to learn these things and get familiar with them?#The pay? $12/hr#I often ask hiring managers (or HR folks) what they want the person to do from day to day. Are they looking for someone to help identify solutions to problems that are poorly formed? Or, maybe, simply an existing workflow to make it easier for management to consume information? If their answer is unclear, and uses buzz words, I often ask them to try to explain the situation without the buzz words.#Everyone wants the moon on a stick. Anything that says MS + 3 years experience you should definitely apply for. Anything that says MS + 6 years of experience you should think about, but probably still apply for. This is especially true of positions that are not a supervisory role (i.e., being another statistician's boss)."

Raises only happen if you ask for them at my company. People go years without getting one sometimes. I was so overdue, I got a 44% raise in January.#Generally a cost of living raise is anywhere from 1-3% once a year. Depends on your company/profession/experience.I generally get like 4-5% a year#I work for the government. We are lucky if we get 1-3% each year.#4-5%, generally.

If promotion 15-25% increase, depending on if you make a new rank. If no promotion 1-4% increase.#About 10% every March-ish. It’s automatic/we don’t have to beg for it, which is nice.#We get notice of our raises right before our fiscal year starts on July 1.

I work in tech. I’m a software engineer. Those working in my technology stack know who I am, either by my open source, my twitter, or my technical writing. My first job out of grad school was here in the city, 3.5 years ago. I made $100,000 even. A year later I made $112,500. A year later I made $170,000. Today, I make $340,000. The small jump was a raise/annual review. The larger jumps were me getting a new job and asking for what I perceived to be my value. I expect that this time next year the number will be $400,000 and that I’ll have difficulty breaking much higher than $500,000. I doubt I’d have to job hop to get to those levels.Annual evaluations seem to vary company to company. They all aim for the beginning or end of the year. They all run late. So sometimes February. Sometimes as late as April.#My company is April. That includes merit increases or legit promotions. I don’t know whose knob you have to bob to get a mid-year promotion because it happens, but it’s rare even if there are vacancies.Edit: merit without promo 3-4% if you’re lucky, promo 10% if you’re lucky, but realistically 7%#Non profit exec here. COL increases of 1-3% depending on government contracts. I get a bonus of up to 5% annually.

Maybe it's about time I looked around for something new... but we've all been there for a long time and we're all pretty comfortable with the job and the benefits. Still, over all those years an extra 1.5% some of the others are getting would have added up.#Annual raises at my last 3 companies were given in Dec along with annual bonus. Payable dates varied but were usually within 1-6 weeks.My raises have averaged 6% but I also had a few job changes which is where the real raises come from. Bonuses have a been anywhere between 15% and 25%.

Everything is negotiable when it comes to salary, and if you feel you're undervalued you should look into moving jobs.#I walked in your shoes for a decade. I decided they didn’t fit well.#Not OP but speaking for myself: tech. Especially at a profitable startup.#a detailed rundown on those leaps, along with a brief synopsis of what happened during those time periods:$100-$112,500: I busted my ass. I was quick to pick up and had insane output given the working conditions. Looking back I would describe this job as abusive and a hostile work environment. Worked long hours — 10AM-midnight wasn’t uncommon. It tore apart a 6 year relationship with the girl I was living with. My product manager was a racist, sexist piece of shit that actively took credit for my personal accomplishments while throwing all blame towards me, the engineer. I frequently got chewed out over his decisions. I took this time to start working in open source. I did some technical writing, which was shared by relatively famous engineering through leaders. I started working on a side project. $112,500-$170,000: At that first job, I was due for a new review. Review was in late January. On December 15th or so, just a few days before Christmas, I get given a new high priority feature to ship before the end of the year. I start working on it, and come to realize that the design makes no sense given what we’re trying to do. Our designer is on vacation. I’m the only engineer in the office. I build it to spec. It gets merged in and ready to ship. Problem 1: I don’t have release access and cannot ship the product. The people with release access are on vacation. Problem 2: my product manager had, unknown to me, promised our largest customers that this feature would have been shipped by the end of November. And put it into writing. And signed a $6,000,000 3-year contract on the back of this commitment. Anyways, it didn’t ship until everyone got back from vacation in January. Fast forward to review time. My PM has once again thrown me under the bus. My manager gives me a real talking to. I get no raise. I tell him that I’m effectively going to leave and that when I do, he better be ready to lose his team because the team isn’t sticking around after I bounce. He laughs it off and says I’m thinking a bit too highly of myself, my impact, and my potential. A week later, I put in my 2 weeks. Before those two weeks are up, the rest of my team — except for my PM — put in their two weeks. I got a huge salary bump by taking the new job. I’m still working on my side proxy and open source. I’m still doing a good deal of technical writing. (My old team and I keep in touch. We are great friends. They all landed on their feet in way better positions)$170,000: I bust ass, but I didn’t have to. This job has an extremely relaxed culture. The pace of the company is slow, but I keep moving as if I still worked at a startup. I stop working on my oss, technical writing, and am putting minimal effort into my side project. I think “wow, I’ve made it. This is it, this is the top.” My side project starts picking up a ton of steam. It’s getting close to review time. I’m starting to enter talks about selling my side project to large organizations and coming on to work on it full time. I let management know. They understand. Talks are pretty deep now, and we’re getting close to cutting a final deal. At review time, they don’t give me a raise at all — but they instead give me a $25,000 spot bonus in addition to my yearly bonus. It’s an acknowledgement of my hard work, but also an acknowledgement that they fully expect me to take the deal and leave. I take the deal. It’s enough cash to buy an apartment. So I do. $340,000: I’m having a blast working with amazing people building the thing that I’ve been wanting to build since I got into this crazy mess. I have more free time than I’ve ever had before, but I’m also more productive than I’ve ever been. I’m excited to go to work. I am happy to go to work. *this has gotta be the top, right*#the problem with government work is that your salary is linked to your title. if the title your in says you only get x-z pay range, then thats all you get until you try to switch to a different title which could be impossible or take years. also some titles have unions and some unions do a horrible job of trying to advocate for pay raises. its a mess, working in the private sector is much much better as you can always get pay raises#Yeah I am starting to decide that myself as well lol#You code less these days, I imagine?#Ooooh#So true. I’m one of those unionized employees you’re referring to. Haven’t had a raise in 2.5 years despite good performance reviews. And with every raise we do get, union fees go up#I still write code daily. At some point — likely soon — I’m gonna have to stop and focus fully on the team at large and the product direction.#This is why I only briefly worked in government.  There’s very little incentive especially if you’re young. No way they are going to be able to pay out on pensions when you’re close and damn sure they’re gonna need to take more from you each year (while cutting benefits) to pay out the olds now.
docker;dglr4i;1570830069.0;/r/docker/comments/dglr4i/netdata_the_opensource_realtime_performance_and/;Netdata, the open-source real-time performance and health monitoring, released v1.18!;"Hi all, Release v1.18.0 contains 5 new collectors, 19 bug fixes, 28 improvements, and 20 documentation updates.**At a glance** The **database engine** is now the default method of storing metrics in Netdata. You immediately get more efficient and configurable long-term metrics storage without any work on your part. By saving recent metrics in RAM and ""spilling"" historical metrics to disk for long-term storage, the database engine is laying the foundation for many more improvements to distributed metrics.We even have a [tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/longer-metrics-storage/) on switching to the database engine and getting the most from it. Or, just read up on [how performant](https://docs.netdata.cloud/database/engine/#evaluation) the database engine really is.Both our **python.d** and **go.d** plugins now have more **intelligent auto-detection** by periodically dump a list of active modules to disk. When Netdata starts, such as after a reboot, the plugins use this list of known services to re-establish metrics collection much more reliably. No more worrying if the service or application you need to monitor starts up minutes after Netdata.Two of our new collectors will help those with Hadoop big data infrastructures. The **HDFS and Zookeeper collection modules** come with essential alarms requested by our community and Netdata's auto-detection capabilities to keep the required configuration to an absolute minimum. Read up on the process via our [HDFS and Zookeeper tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/monitor-hadoop-cluster/).Speaking of new collectors—we also added the ability to collect metrics from SLAB cache, Gearman, and vCenter Server Appliances.Before v1.18, if you wanted to create alarms for each dimension in a single chart, you need to write separate entities for each dimension—not very efficient or user-friendly. New **dimension templates** fix that hassle. Now, a single entity can automatically generate alarms for any number of dimensions in a chart, even those you weren't aware of! Our [tutorial on dimension templates](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/dimension-templates/) has all the details.v1.18 brings support for installing Netdata on offline or air-gapped systems.

linux;dgla2w;1570827854.0;/r/linux/comments/dgla2w/netdata_the_opensource_realtime_performance_and/;Netdata, the open-source real-time performance and health monitoring, released v1.18!;"Hi all, Release v1.18.0 contains 5 new collectors, 19 bug fixes, 28 improvements, and 20 documentation updates.**At a glance** The **database engine** is now the default method of storing metrics in Netdata. You immediately get more efficient and configurable long-term metrics storage without any work on your part. By saving recent metrics in RAM and ""spilling"" historical metrics to disk for long-term storage, the database engine is laying the foundation for many more improvements to distributed metrics.We even have a [tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/longer-metrics-storage/) on switching to the database engine and getting the most from it. Or, just read up on [how performant](https://docs.netdata.cloud/database/engine/#evaluation) the database engine really is.Both our **python.d** and **go.d** plugins now have more **intelligent auto-detection** by periodically dump a list of active modules to disk. When Netdata starts, such as after a reboot, the plugins use this list of known services to re-establish metrics collection much more reliably. No more worrying if the service or application you need to monitor starts up minutes after Netdata.Two of our new collectors will help those with Hadoop big data infrastructures. The **HDFS and Zookeeper collection modules** come with essential alarms requested by our community and Netdata's auto-detection capabilities to keep the required configuration to an absolute minimum. Read up on the process via our [HDFS and Zookeeper tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/monitor-hadoop-cluster/).Speaking of new collectors—we also added the ability to collect metrics from SLAB cache, Gearman, and vCenter Server Appliances.Before v1.18, if you wanted to create alarms for each dimension in a single chart, you need to write separate entities for each dimension—not very efficient or user-friendly. New **dimension templates** fix that hassle. Now, a single entity can automatically generate alarms for any number of dimensions in a chart, even those you weren't aware of! Our [tutorial on dimension templates](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/dimension-templates/) has all the details.v1.18 brings support for installing Netdata on offline or air-gapped systems.

labrats;dkks74;1571583943.0;/r/labrats/comments/dkks74/how_do_you_organise_your_lab_life/;How do you organise your lab life?;"Hi everyone, I've just started a PhD in biopharm and received a few seminars about organising data files, results printouts, lab book, protocols, papers etc. It all pretty much just summed up to ""label everything and keep a filing system that you can cross reference"". I've kept lab books before at undergrad and masters but since they were such short projects I could get away with having them (and my protocols/data) all in a bit of a mess since it wasn't too hard to find anything. The move to pharmacy from biology is also throwing me a little since drug development is understandably more stringently regulated. My faculty have said that their lab books should be just for experiments, and not a dumping ground for notes or random thoughts from meetings, or even protocols. It's okay to keep protocols and big data printouts etc that are relevant in a separate folder and then reference to them in the lab book. Apparently the best PhDs have a coding/numbering system to refer to protocols and individual experiments (since obviously the latter can overlap and lab books are supposed to be strictly chronological) as well as digital files for data analysis. I use mendeley for papers but other than that I have no idea where to even start with developing a system that makes sense and takes all of this into account.Any ideas/suggestions?";"Whatever you do, I suggest using a date system of yearmonthday (so today would be 191020) to help you keep track of stuff. For digital data, I use project folders, and then subdivide that as needed. Files start with the date, then the project, then the name of the file. Bound lab notebooks are where I put my data and write ups. Incidental notes (280s, volumes, etc) are in a steno notebook that doesn’t get archived. I have separate lined notebooks for my meeting notes that is also not archived. Batch records in large quantities go into binders that are referenced to bound notebooks and archived. Hope that helps. :)#Every lab is different. Our lab prefers experiments in a bound lab notebook, notes can be anywhere you want, and data can be stored depending on how it is acquired because we use a digital cloud system. Therefore, If you label your data to match your experiment title / number / whatever system your lab uses you can find the digital data that goes with it. For sheets (primers, 96 well printouts, etc) we have binders for physical copies and the digital ones on the cloud. It’s all accessible by anyone in the lab at any time.#[deleted]#To keep track of experiments, I find that keeping a ppt deck is helpful. But in terms of generating files, eg assay runs and what not, having a date and experiment-type in the label of the file is always helpful. Consolidate the results that you're gonna use for reporting on a semi-regular basis eg weekly or fortnightly (cos we know, experiments fail all the time and results used for troubleshooting isn't going to be documented that well... Or spend as much time as one ought to in them.)#1) I use OneNote because it syncs to my phone and desktop so I can reference my notes while in lab if necessary. I have a ""protocols"" tab, a ""reagents"" tab, and a ""notebook"" tab, so I can paste in experiments to the notebook that I do regularly and link to details about any reagents I use. In the notebook tab, every day is its own page, labeled with the date and has a day-to-day ""checklist"" for me to carry out for the day. Experiments are sub-pages under the day they were performed. I prefer online notebooks for Ctrl+C/V/F, but like having paper to write on, so I print experiments out, write calculations/observations/modifications/etc. on them, and eventually scan them back into OneNote, while also storing the hard-copy in a binder just in case.2) Data is also stored in folders labeled with the YYYYMMDD and a descriptive title.3) I also plan experiments in OneNote, one per page, but don't make it a sub-page until it's done. So my notebook looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/pMWt28O#It's going to depend on what you are doing and what your prof wants I tend to keep data in spreadsheets (concentration calculations so I will have the electronic version and a print out in my notebook.As far as notes vs. Data only I would have two notebooks one is more you ideas/planning. Like future ideas targets to check out etc. The other is more experimental related. This is where you put your experiment stuff. That said if it's related to the setup/protocol than put it in there also. Like if you are troubleshooting an antibody you might run several combos of antibody concentrations that may or may not work. I would also make notes on the outcomes (I. E. This blot sucked do something different or adjust this for next time, or this image was awesome so use this for the paper). You should put anything related to the process there.Since I work with data files and images I often reference the file in the section.I tell my students to do something like the following.DateProject nameBrief sentence what you did (pho-AKT on XX samplesSamples used (concentration, dilution, treatment length etc. Protocol of what you didIf it's the first time write everything out otherwise reference the protocol noting any changes. E. G. Protocol run as described xx/xx/XX with the following changes , 20ug of protein loaded. Concentration used at XX rather than yy.Then print out of results/tables/graph. Full results/images are in folder/filename.Samples are in x spot in freezer. Basically enough info to find it. Files are all named the same wayProject.Assay.initials.dateFolders on computer are project/experiment. E. G. Pepper/westerns/all Western dataOr for histo stuffPepper/liver/stain/animal #I am pretty easy going on most stuff but super anal about my systems probably because I started doing things before I diagnosed my adhd and would lose concentration and misplace things. I also have a freezer log for my - 80. Each spot on the racks as a spreadsheet cell and I expect them to get filled in Honestly build your system at the beginning. It sucks going back and finding things#I would read about Good documentation practices used in GMP labs. Essentially everything gets recorded first in your notebook. Raw data especially. From there you can reference that data in excel sheets, protocols etc and the reference will go back to your notebook with the page included! This is how we document data in a GMP lab and it really helps keep things organized. Hope this helps!#Yea i personally am terrible with writing a ""lab"" notebook and most of my documentation is my quick notes on what I did /where to find the main file. That said I keep track of the things one would normally write in a lab book on the data files. I use an Odyssey for westerns so I mark antibodies /concentration etc in the file areaI really want my lab to use an electronic lab notebook setup but I haven't found a cheap quality one. Ependorf has a slick system but it's   $$.Might have to try one note again since we get it free#My golden advice is just keep in mind your filepath length in the Windows file system can only have up to 256 characters including whitespace. Successfully exceeding the character limit will break your files, and make it hard to move, open or rename them sometimes, until you can get the path length below 256 characters. It's very easy to do, and it's commonly done because people try to cram tons of information into folder and file names.#If your lab can afford it, use a laboratory information management system (LIMS). If not, you can still use barcode labels with a 2D phone scanner, and keep track of everything online. Otherwise, if you're going real low-tech, set up a series of folder paths and excel files to deal with your experiments. Label everything with the experiment #, date, and all other info pertinent to the samples, and mark everything you do down in your notebook as clearly as possible. Marking which protocol you used is also useful within the lab book, but give the exact file you took it from, since it can be changed over time. When it comes to online files, I like to version up whenever there's a change, so I'll go: PCR\_protocol\_TSCKO mice\_v1.docx and move to PCR\_protocol\_TSCKO\_mice\_v2 if there's a change. Same applies when I'm writing papers or any fellowship applications.#.#I'm in industry doing research so YMMV.  My own filing system isn't without flaw and I often have redundant files but I can always find what I need.I segregate things first by project, then I segregate by type (protocol, data, library, random notes, images, etc).  After that, every file is named [Year_Month_Date [Description of File Contents]].I'll often write down the file name I need in my notebook so I can reference it as well.#This is really similar to what I do: digital data is organized by project folders, and sub folders for dated experiments  most files start with a year-month-day heading (so c://documents/data/gene-of-interest/protein expressions/19-10-20-IP-WB/19-10-20-wb-ecl.tifWe use a cloud-based journal system where experiments get written up and summarized. Data files can be attached but I don’t usually attach raw files  just summary graphs and tables. The experiments that are recorded there go by the same date-title heading as in my digital file on the hard drive, so it should be pretty easy to back-track the source data on the final presentation. I keep a file folder for all projects as well where I store any paper, whether hand-recorded data, printouts, reference manuals, product documents, etc.  it’s kind of a mess but that’s where that stuff goes. I also keep note pads (I’m on #12 now) where I keep all my little hand-written notes of the day: lists of things to do, stuff to buy, notes from meetings, the odd data point, quick experimental design mock-ups etc. it’s a total jumble but I try to note the date at least once a week, so I can usually find whatever I’m looking for if I have a rough idea of where it is in time.#Thank you, I'll definitely be sure to use something that works for both digital and physical files!#That's the kind of numbering I was hoping someone might suggest. Thank you!#I did this in my old job and it is a life saver when you are asked for data on the fly!#That's legit a beautiful system, you should be proud. I have a full page per day diary that I was planning to use for hourly plans but I will definitely work it in with a OneNote system. Thank you!#So want to say thanks for reminding me about Onenote.I have been trying to put together a ""crib sheet"" for interpreting histo stains and it is perfect for it since I can drop in images from the web etc and it puts links in.how did you organize the experiments page to look like that?  I like the top down org as opposed to  the horizontal tabs.#Wow, thanks for such a detailed response. I'm not in the lab yet since I'm still figuring out a starting point/ordering reagents etc so I wanted to sort out my filing system now. I really appreciate it#It does, thank you! There's a lot of industrial overlap/collabs in my lab so I'll look into it for sure#Thank you both! I should have mentioned that they want a bound lab book. How do you define projects inside the PhD? Maybe it's just first-month overwhelmedness but the finer points all seem to blur together for me at the moment.#Easiest way is to give your experiments ‘experiment numbers’ so anyone can look on the hard drive for a number code rather than ‘western blot of beta actin from October 20th’ or something like that#So shockingly I have an order spreadsheet alsoEach funding source has its own tabEach tab has a column for:Quote #Date ordered /requestedDate receivedVendorItem descriptionCatalog numberUnitPrice per unitTotal costNotesI would also put tabs for common codes (my postdoc place gave us different account codes for different grants)You could put details  for commonly ordered stuff/primers etcI would have a separate folder for vendor quotes.#Yeah at your stage it’s hard to define them (unless someone has already roadmapped your entire PhD which is unlikely).  I’m not a student (I’m staff) so I have over a dozen projects that are ongoing, paused while waiting for something else to happen, or in limbo/defunct. Many of them have no relation to one another, since I’m not trying to write a thesis. Some of them are even data generated for other people’s projects, when I’ve been asked to help out, so I have a separate folder of “other people’s data>Bob, Sally, etc.”Projects just evolve. For example, I thought when I first started this job, I’d be doing a lot of RT-qPCR. So I had a file for that, with each different set of experiments in a sub folder inside. But then one of the genetic pathways we were interested in got funded (thanks to some preliminary qPCR work!), and now it’s a whole thing with many more methods than qPCR. So I started a new project folder, called it “geneX regulation” and shifted the geneX qPCR folder inside it. Eventually you’ll see the forest for the trees. At some point you’ll have mapped out your program of study, have some basic thesis chapters (ie top-level projects) in mind, and data will (hopefully) easily fall under their headings. For now, I suggest you just record/store data in time, and sort it out later. Talk with your PI often about where you are in the research plan, and consider using something like a Gannt chart to stay on track. To be honest, I don’t like bound journals, because it makes it very difficult to keep organized, let alone reorganize. Nobody conducts research in the style that you practice in a chemistry lab course (week1: start experiment 1, finish experiment 1, analyze experiment 1  week 2: start experiment 2, etc). For many of us, the kind of data we handle these days doesn’t even belong on paper. The whole “write only in pen in a bound journal” attitude is outdated, IMO. But ya gotta do it the way the boss wants it...#I’m not a PhD, I work in industry, but I’ve always worked on multiple projects at once. I have bound lab notebooks for each project, which I keep up with batch records and written (printed out) experiment summaries. The word documents are then what I use to make my reports at the end of development. Keeping bound notebooks or ELN’s is important for IP reasons, even as they’re not the easiest to keep organized. If you can keep one per major project that will help a lot. :)#That's actually pretty reassuring, thanks. I'd not heard of a Gantt chart before, it looks like it'll be useful in the long run. I'm not a massive fan of the bound lab book either, nothing else I do is done on paper and it makes it difficult to keep track of both it and digital data at the same time. Apparently it's because the work my faculty do is so interdisciplinary and everyone wants them done with different formats so physical copies are the only way to make everyone ~~un~~happy (?). But everyone here has given me some excellent suggestions so hopefully it staves off the inevitable breakdown/drowning in poor filing!"

How do your observations lead to the end of democracy?#> 1 :  Big data will make privacy protection impossible . When you can analyze human behavior 24/7 you know when and what you should do to achieve desirable outcome . I'm not following how this leads to democracy's death. Could you expand more?  > 2 : Automatization will worsen economic inequality . If the most work is performing by robots and AI you don't need many people to make economy grow . If so you will end with unnecessary masses . It will aim to seize the means of production . Rich people will not allow it To put bluntly, there's a lot more poor people than rich people.  Assuming this issue does happen, and nothing is done on a societal level to fix it, there will be revolutions that the rich can do nothing about. Money is only power if you have somewhere to spend it.> 3 : With progress in neuroscience you can add chips or nanorobots into human brain . With such technics you can transform everyone into obedient slave or soldier . Such people will not rebel against their masters Even in the modern day this is still science fiction. The brain is largely a mystery to us still: the most advanced thing I've seen is being able to analyze brainwave patterns to detect thoughts of simple shapes, which still requires a giant MRI machine. Maybe someday this will be a branch of science we have to worry about, but not ""soon"" by any measure.Also, there is the more human response to this which is that you'd need to get these mind control chips into people in the first place, which just isn't going to happen in an already-functioning democracy.> 4 : Censorship and surveillance can effectively divide people. If you have an analog to Chinese social credit system you can prevent meetings between one group of people and encourage another . This is another thing that can prevent democracies, but you'd be hard pressed to ever create a system like this is an existing democracy. People recognize how scary these things are, and I can all but guarantee you'd never see the like in the US or Britain.> 5 : Many people in second an third world don't like everything Western . For example Saudi Arabia and China effectively prevent growth of Western culture . They also think that democracy is detrimental to their culture This only contributes to killing democracy if either A) these countries invade existing democracies, or B) they shut them down in some other form (for example, economic collapse). While certainly not impossible, right now they just don't have the power to unilaterally do something like this. The US still has a strong democratic foothold everywhere, not to mention the EU and other smaller powers.#That's why anarcho-communism is the only possible democracy, on the long run#[deleted]#>Big dataThis assumes that there won’t be regulations put on data collection and the use of AI to manipulate people.  There are already some serious conversations being had about data privacy and most people do believe we should have more if it.  It’s only being talked about now because it’s a new problem, but it is only a matter of time before the policies and presidents are set up to handle the new Information Age problem.>AutomationHere is the problem with your prediction: the rich rely on the poor buying things in order to remain rich.  If the majority of the population is unemployed, they will no longer be spending money and many will find other mediums for exchange like bartering.  There is certainly a debate on how long it will take to get to this point, but I do believe there are solutions to it such as universal basic income.  If things could ever by fully automated, it may even make something akin to communism practical.  Under democracy though, it’s the underpaid masses who have most of the votes so they will still have a say on solutions that benefit them.>Brain chipsWhat you describe is certainly possible, but it’s technology at least a few decades out so there is plenty of time to prepare.  I am certain that as soon as mind control capabilities are demonstrated with the technology, law makers would waste no time banning them.  If someone does use them to control the population, they would probably already need a totalitarian government in order to get them in everyone and it would no doubt piss off other countries.  There is also the problem of motivation, why would you do this if automation has already gotten so good that you don’t need workers?  Humans are already outdone by machines in terms of muscle so right now our cleverness is what we have over machines, taking away our ability to critically think would just turn humanity into particularly high maintenance drones that can be outdone in every way by an AI controlling a robot.>Censorship and surveillanceDemocracy is pretty good at preventing this because people don’t like surveillance and censorship.  You use China as an example, but China isn’t a democracy.>Many countries don’t like democracyAnd that’s their opinion to hold.  Democracy does work well though, it’s not perfect but it’s better than the alternatives.We do agree on one thing though: democracy probably won’t last forever.  Machines are slowly becoming better than us at everything, and one day that will include leadership.  I imagine that as long as some dipshit doesn’t make a homocidal AI in the next hundred years there will emerge an altruistic AI that can use data analysis techniques to figure out what people want and use machine learning to constantly improve society.  You are right to have concerns though, as Stephen Hawking said AI could either be the best thing to ever happen to humanity or the worst thing to happen to humanity depending on what we do now.  The same is true of other technologies like brain-computer interfaces, which in a best case scenario could let us slip between the real world and the virtual world at will and download between bodies effectively becoming immortal.  These technologies are not unlike nuclear science, which can either save us from climate change by powering the world or plunge the world into nuclear winter depending on how we use it.  Democracy is probably the best way to make sure we get the good ending here.#Democracy dies when you, as a citizen, decide to be indifferent and refuse to vote.#>1 : Big data will make privacy protection impossible . When you can analyze human behavior 24/7 you know when and what you should do to achieve desirable outcome .Big data is pretty fragmented. It can also be extremely hard to deal with. There isn't really reputable sources on this one, but from what is believed government agencies, arguably the biggest collectors of data, have a terrible time trying to sort through that data to verify things like terrorist acts. The other thing is that who the big data holders are is always changing. It's possible that they might change again. Google was once Yahoo. Facebook was MySpace. Amazon was Ebay. And so on. >2 : Automatization will worsen economic inequality . If the most work is performing by robots and AI you don't need many people to make economy grow .

Rich people will not allow itThere are a whole lot of things that I argue against the automation apocalypse, but I'll start with the main two. 1. A lot of the predictions of the automated apocalypse are based on Moore's law, and Moore's law is dead. One of the main people to predict this apocalyptic like scenario was Ray Kurzweil. John Maynard Keynes actually made this prediction by the 80's to support his theory on the 15 hour work week.2. It's economically impossible. If 50% of jobs are automated that's 50% less people that have their money in the markets, that's 50% less people paying taxes, that's 50% less people buying products and services. If there is no one purchasing services or products their businesses will collapse and the R&D with that business that develop the job stealing robots will go with it. That also goes with government funding. This ties into your rich people statement, because they need people buying shit to maintain their wealth  as most of the rich have their wealth tied up in investments.There has also been countless times where markets have had to adapt to new areas of employment. Most employment consisted of agricultural jobs at one point and now that's a tiny part of employment. We've also had to adjust to various ethnicities entering the work place post 1960's, women entering into more professional positions in the 70's and 80's, and manufacturing leaving to first Japan then China. Job markets have consistently changed with out massive depression. If one sector gets automated out, chances are another one will rise. >3 : With progress in neuroscience you can add chips or nanorobots into human brain . With such technics you can transform everyone into obedient slave or soldier . Such people will not rebel against their mastersThis is a stretch to correlate this to the death of democracy. >4 : Censorship and surveillance can effectively divide people. If you have an analog to Chinese social credit system you can prevent meetings between one group of people and encourage another.Encrypted technology is alway ahead of decryption. There will always be new tricks and new techniques to avoid surveillance and there is tipping points to things  usually economic or geopolitical. Honestly, I can't argue this one too much because I have fixed amount of time.>5 : Many people in second an third world don't like everything Western . For example Saudi Arabia and China effectively prevent growth of Western culture . They also think that democracy is detrimental to their culture[The trend for democracy across third world countries.](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy) I should also mention that it is highly likely that African countries will form some form of trade union like the EU. There is trends that suggest that economic liberalization come hand in hand with democracy. >6 : Fake news are spreading throughout the world . Everyday we loose confidence in our newspapers . Already we can find a reports on stories that doesn't exist . In future deepfakes will advanced to the level where you can't understand which video is true and which is not .There's already AI that can predict deepfakes. When it comes to fake news there's a lot of factors. Are people that share fake news doing so regardless if it's true to be politically partisan? Although there is probably more fake news, there's also an easier ability to fact check news due to the internet. Outright political propaganda doesn't seem to have the same effect that it once did without the internet.#We’ve never had a democracy. Democracy is a concept, not a system of government. Something that never existed cannot die.#Democracy isn’t valid anyways. Let it fall and let the tyrants try to control. They will fail and minarchy should be formed#There is no real democracy to begin with.There is no honest democratic country, basically every politician is corrupt, electrons get rigged nonstop, backhand deals, lobbys etc. Media only propagates the term democracy so people live with the illusion that their vote matters, to keep them from revolting.#>When you can analyze human behavior 24/7 you know when and what you should do to achieve desirable outcome .While ads can certainly influence behavior, human beings are far too complex to control with that level of precision.  Just look at what is happening in Hong Kong right now - China has some of the most draconian surveillance and data manipulation on the planet, yet they are unable to stop a massive protest from happening.  If they are unable to control behavior enough to stop such an event, we can rest somewhat assured that our technology is no where near powerful enough to do what you are worried about.>Automatization will worsen economic inequality Up to a point, but ideas like universal basic income exist to solve that problem when/if it happens.  If there is one thing history has shown is that when wealth inequality gets too great, distribution is inevitable.>Rich people will not allow it There is only so much you can do to stop it.  Rich people require poor people to tow the line in order to stay rich.  If enough poor people rise up and revolt, then revolution will succeed.  You can't just kill all the poor people and hope to have a society left.  >With such technics you can transform everyone into obedient slave or soldier This is science fiction at this point and we have nowhere near a sophisticated enough understanding of the brain to do something like this.>Censorship and surveillance can effectively divide peopleSee my point above about Hong Kong.>For example Saudi Arabia and China effectively prevent growth of Western culture They try, but they are not doing a great job of succeeding.  Again, see Hong Kong.#3 is a HUGE stretch. Even if it was possible (and it won't be for 100+ years), *mandatory* implantation would never be a thing in this country.#Democracy will stick around for a long time because democracy has always been about convincing the masses that they have influence over the elite. Democracy is already dead because it never lived in the idealistic view the masses were told. You are not free in a democratic country and never were. However, the illusion of freedom will stay alive in the masses mind and thus the elite will continue with democracy as they always have, to placate the masses but to not actually give them power.#[deleted]#[deleted]#Do systems of government that aren't just concepts exist, and if so, what are they?#[deleted]#[deleted]#Where does democracy exist?#To be clear, are you saying this is a problem because the parties will gain a majority because they understand what problems their constituents want and offer policies to fix those problems? That feels like ideal democracy, not the death of democracy.#Systems of government are driven by economics. Feudalism existed because capital was mostly non-renewable. Contrast that with Rome that had a market system and was a Republic, until its slow decline. Mercantilism was a bridge between feudalism and capitalism as capital could be renewed. The most effective governments are Republics. But republics exist because of strong markets. Markets depend on spending (this is why Ford raises wages  his sales were slipping). So if automation causes unemployment, the US will need UBI - which is as good as socialism. Instead of workers seizing the means of production, they will have to seize capital that facilitates the means of production. At some point a decision must be made as to if entrepreneurs deserve a perpetual lion share of profits if labor is whom facilitates it. But there is no one label to give a country’s government. It isn’t black and white. In the later 1930s government basically seized the means of production and WWII put it back in the hands of private ownership. How the government seized it is a PhD level discussion I can’t facilitate as it’s Reddit and I don’t have a PhD.#Perhaps, but that doesn't address my underlying point.  China has one of the most efficient propaganda and control regimes ever devised, and it has spectacularly failed to prevent these protests.If a government that makes it a central mission to control information to prevent dissent fails in its ability to do so, it is shows that the level of control you fear is simply not possible at this point.#Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/Tseliteiv ([2∆](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/Tseliteiv)).^[Delta System Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)#[deleted]#[deleted]#I disagree with your argument that China has a efficient propaganda apparatus. It's cringe worthy, crude, hamfisted, and does not resonate with the populace. It's the least effective organ in their whole administration.Anyone that has been immersed into the Chinese online communities know that the frenzied nationalism has grown despite the government arm not due to it.#Is it really? The right wing LDP has been in power near continuously since the end of WW2 and the return of power from the US back to Japanese, and their right wing ideology is not at all reflective of the general Japanese opinion. The average Japanese person is deeply disconnected from government policy, and does not believe that the government affects their lives one party or the other.#The US federal government has limited authority no matter which party is in power. We're seeing it now. The Republican president is testing the bounds of Presidential authority and Congress and the Courts are pushing back based on the Constitution and established federal law.#Okay, I see the potential issue now, but I don't see how increased insight into voters would make this a problem when it isn't already. For one, there have been times in history when political parties in democracies have achieved majorities: why didn't they do this then?#That is kind of my point though.  The Chinese government does their very best to control the narrative, to the point of censoring nearly every information outlet available, and yet they are not successful.  The population sees the manipulation and resists it.Mass manipulation like this does not work, because there will always be people skeptical of the official narrative, and information is more accessible than every.  For every control technique developed, a way to thwart that technique is not far behind.  The tighter the attempt to control, the more people realize it and resist."

I’m head of marketing in a fairly big Mexican online clothing brand, this has been my job for 5 years now but I think it is time to create my own path, I have an idea and I already have a pretty big data and research on market and also on the business model, my question may be silly for all of you more experienced folks but I’m just starting in my journey, I would like to know where I could find a good CTO, because I’m really good in my field (digital marketing) but I lack the technical knowledge to actually start to develop a MVP. Thanks!;"Good luck finding a legitimately talented CTO at the idea phase without giving away most of your company / paying a decent salary.I’ve seen this a million times and it never works out well. If you don’t have a tech skill set or someone already in your corner, get ready to pay the big bucks for it or have a nightmare on your hands to deal with later with incompetent developers.#Poach a technicial person in your own company that you’ve worked with.#I'd ask you first, why do you need a CTO? Do you have investors and a board? If the answer is ""no"" then you are not looking for a CTO but rather just a Sr. Engineer who can bootstrap your idea.A CTO would be a person in charge of an engineering team, at the very least, if you don't have people in a company them nobody is an executive, sorry.My point here is this: don't get dragged into the cool tech jargon, it may repel engineers who may feel overwhelmed by the title but that could very well help you land your idea.Good luck!#I think the best approach is to offer lots of money.  If you can't do that, offer some money and lots of equity.  There are a bunch of ""tech co-founder"" boards.  You could also just make an r/forhire post.The hard part is finding someone good if you don't actually have money.#I've been worked with many startups and couple times was invited to be a CTO.Every time, real situation was the same: those startups just wanted all-in-one developer.You may start with some good developer/tech guy, if you have money for MVP, and then either hire CTO or promote your best tech.#I started my career as an employee of digital marketing agency in the 2000. The agency broke, and I started my own company in 2004. As Internet was evolving, it was necessary to have more and more tech guys, a manager and someone to lead them... a CTO/TechLead!After some trials with more than 6 different CTOs in 5 years, spending a lot of money (most of the times their sallary was heigher than mine - CEO), and being frustrated by the results, I decided to change my life by becoming the CTO myself.It took me almost 10 years to feel confortable, but It was the best decision I\`ve made ever... CEOs are easier to find and their mindset is more risk oriented, on average.On the other hand, tech guys tend to be emotionally weak/unexperienced and  ""fanatic"" about a technology. Once I had to ""unhire"" a CTO just because 5 coders said they would quit the company because the guy as an idiot.I sold my agency in 2009 (25 employees) and created a brand new e-commerce ticketing platform with a CEO/friend and sold it in 2017/18 (55 employees).I have good proposals to be a CTO, but I prefer to come up with my ideas and then hire / negotiate with a good CEO...#I'm looking for an opportunity to work as a CTO for an idea which have potential of growth. Let's connect and discuss. PM#Happens a lot, I am always curious how people work for years add companies but didnt make a single friend over at the engineering department. Like other have said, you are going to pay. Shares or money, devs have a high average salary. Maybe you can show traction to get some money and people on board.But don’t outsource, never do it in a startup.#Dm me mano stupid tilde#Learn how to code. Not because you’ll have to code it yourself, but you have to be able to interact with the other founder, also you have to show some effort and be able to at least be of help when coding. Like one of the comments above mentioned, when someone is looking for a CTO what most founders want is “someone who can code it all” which is a huge mistake. Basically you’re asking someone else to do it all, and that - most of the time - won’t fly.If you’ll excuse the link, I wrote about this in Medium a few weeks ago. That’s the best advice I can provide based on my experience https://medium.com/@tomsawada/how-to-get-a-technical-partner-26a26c9f78a#Took a micro second to tell the author was Latin#Check out Caya’s Slidebean videos about this theme: https://youtu.be/xx9twpiiF5U#You need to have a friend who knows to code#I'd consider outsourcing if you have budget. Especially if your tech needs are tiny.Pros:- You hire a team that is known to work well together- You hire it immediately and altogether- You only pay when the guys are working- No equity risksCons:- Cost per hour 2-5x times higher than hiring guys with same level of proficiency- Still nice to have a tech person on your side to minimise risks with IT guys overtaking your business, but actually this is really-really unlikely and is not priority at start- Same problems finding proficient team as with CTO searchEach case is different, but you can request a quote from several outsourcing shops, do the math and then make a decision.#Best answer by far"

BATProject;dk5dbw;1571499647.0;/r/BATProject/comments/dk5dbw/why_should_people_get_paid_to_view_ads/;Why should people get paid to view ads?;"Hey everyone, I am HUGE fan of Brave. Been using it for about 6 months now and the experience has been great. I went to the recent Brave meetup in Montreal and got a bunch of merchandise, a lot of people started asking me what it is. I also just speak about it a lot with my friends, disparaging Google and trying to get them to use Brave (I've gotten 5 people to download it and of the 5, 2 of them are now full time Brave users). Anyway, I find myself explaining the core principles behind Brave to people quite often. Only thing is I don't feel like I explain it well, especially when it comes to WHY people should get paid for viewing ads. I often say things like, ""it's about valuing user attention"" ... people just nod and look kind of confused after that one. I've tried ""Google and Facebook make 100% of the profits when YOU view ads they show you, meaning that they are profiting off of work / effort that you're putting in. they are profiting off of your time and attention"" this one resonates a bit more but people still dont quite grasp why this is important. Of course, people ask how much money I've made and I tell them like 80 cents in a month and theyre just like oh thats lame. So, to my fellow Bravers, how do you explain Brave? what lines have you used that really resonate with people? Especially in regards to Basic Attention Token.  Word of mouth is extremely important in my eyes. Even if I don't convince someone to download and use Brave, I want to make them think twice about their Internet use and the prying eyes of big data.";"Honestly the economic incentives  aren't there yet. Until users earn ~$15-20 a month, at least enough to pay for a Netflix subscription,  leading with ad rewards isn't  the best incentive.  Speed and privacy is the bread and butter right now. Especially in the online environment today. A lot of people are waking up, concern over user data is at a boiling point.  When ad rewards are up to par for most normies, expect a firestorm.#Say to selfish people: ""You are paying for the bandwidth to download the ads, so it's kinda like the advertisers are picking up part of the cost.""Say to thoughtful people: ""You're not being paid, you're being *rewarded,* and you're being rewarded with *votes*. The votes are called ""BAT."" Look at this triangle graphic. See *Advertiser, User, Publisher?*  The advertisers reward users with BAT, the Users use the BAT to vote for Creators, then the Advertisers pay the Creators money based on how  Users voted. Your votes decide how much the advertisers pay the Creators. Since each of your votes for a Creator has the effect of increasing their income, it's like a tip-jar, so Brave calls it ""Tipping."" The eighty cents is peanuts to you, but it adds up for the Creators.""""And it's all anonymous. No one knows how you voted: not Brave, not the Advertisers,  not even the Creators. That's one thing that makes it different from Patreon or Kickstarter.""#The facts I like to mention.1) it costs money to run servers to host websites and stream video to people.2) A lot of people expect it to be for free.3) A lot of people would not be able to afford it if it was not for free. Paywalls make the open internet not open to the people who probably need it most.4) Adverts are a way that keep the internet ""free""5) current advert ecosystem tracks you and harvests your data and uses your battery and bumps up your data costs.6) brave and BAT fixes privacy issues in 5, and pays you for the hidden costs on 5. And internet is still ""free"".#Idk, you’ve explained it pretty well. Maybe describe the relatively small amount you make (~$1-$2/month in some cases).#I skip the bat part and only say it's fast and works great against ads#I wouldn’t focus on the user as someone that earns money, I would say that the browser tracks your attention, and redistributes your ad revenue over the sites you blocked ads from so sites actually get paid respective to how much value they bring to you, instead of who gets lucky you click on their ad. Then explain you’re fully in control of the distribution, you can redistribute anywhere from all to none of your ad rewards over the sites you love.#(1) Saves mobile data(2) Saves phone battery(3) Saves time - faster browsing#Just don't talk about BAT at all, unless they're early adopters they will not even try to understand, especially not for $1/month. You will just confuse them.Brave is good enough that you can get people to download it for other reasons: mainly speed and privacy.Once they use it regularly, you may start talking about BAT.#Charge people $2 per month to use Facebook and they'll beg for BAT#This, and also: its finally an ethically approved way to use an adblocker. I know its not something most people actually think about, But there are lots of principed people that dont like ad Blockers because it undermines the business model of free information on the internet. BAT fixes that.#THIS. Great and short explanation for why BAT/Brave deliver a fundamental solution for a fair, privacy respecting - but still free - web!"
Amsterdam;detetp;1570499582.0;/r/Amsterdam/comments/detetp/salary_ranges_for_it_specialist/;Salary ranges for IT specialist?;[deleted];"[deleted]#The market in Netherlands is all about wheeling in ultra low cost ""high skill"" IT staff from places like Philippines, Pakistan. It used to be from India and China, but those are already no longer taking the lower wages offered, so now employers are increasingly hiring from even lower cost places like Philippines. (where more people fight to get the same job and are ready to do it for lower wage).The last place that looked like Amsterdam, was Singapore when they were at the forefront of hiring ""as many soft IT skilled SE Asians as they could for the lowest wage thinkable"". All in the name of ""global competition! but in the end, you wind up with a city full of the expat type who stay home all day, don't spend a dime and overcrowd houses with their only goal: going back to their country and spend the money on a house there.It's not like the old days when UK or US techies were flown in to actually contribute to the city, invest,and take part! The majority of expats here are all about scraping every penny, even if it means living in dorm style places, saving it all and then flying it back to Asia.There is a tax refund facility called 30% ruling, But even after factoring that one in, ..the money you'll get net will be far lower than in any (!!!) State in the US.It's a ""ultra low wage economy"", IT wise, tbh. Not anything like in the US!!The other thing you'll notice if you ever visit, is that half these new IT ""high skilled"" staff (to be high skilled on that kind of visa, all you need is a degree without any real special skills) are living in questionable living conditions, like they'd stay with 8 people in a single flat, just for the sake of saving money and then flying back home to Asia loaded with savings to buy their new home.I am from the US myself (i didn't come for the money but for a partner) and was quite shocked about the low wages economy. If you ever visit this district in Amsterdam called Amstelveen, you'll see entire building blocks over saturated with pakistani people. We don't even have that in the US!!! (even the Bronx looks better lol). All in all they have a handful ""high tech"" companies like [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) and such, but if you google about them, it's just garbage (not even real high tech or innovative, their' own staff complains they can't understand why old shaky programs are still used!). The Neterlands, in terms of the latest expats ""type"" is quickly headed for the Dubai ""model"" (low cost overcrowded building used as pretty much ""dorms"" and an increasingly visible Filippino etc dominance in the expat market etc)The whole IT deal in the Netherlands is highly overrated. I wouldn't want to have it on my resume lol.For a Pakistani or such, it might be an advancement in many ways. But i highly doubt it's a career advancement for an american, if you know what i mean lol#You can't really compare pre-tax salaries of 2 widely different countries.With the American one is pension contributions counted with the salary? With the Dutch one it almost never is.Also cost of living differ widely country wide, but also regional wise.Best is to check what you keep after tax and check what you'll need to spend to live comfortably.#Dutch salaries are way worse than American ones in IT. Don't go here if you want to make money. Also check the conditions, because pension is included. Just like around 25 days of paid leave a year (starting from day 1), unemployment insurance (while limited if you only work here for a short time) and a really high amount of sick days (I'm still amazed you have to worry about sick days in the US). If you don't want any of these benefits work as ZZP'er and you can earn about twice as much money. Salaries in the Randstad, are a bit higher. But it's also more expensive to live there. Especially if you want to live in Amsterdam. Don't forget that the Netherlands is extremely small.#It wages are low here, no idea why. Companies constantly complain that there’s a shortage of skilled it people but refuse to raise wages. And it’s not like Amsterdam is cheap either. Or that we pay low taxes.#Are you thinking about using DAFT and then do ZZP er work?#[deleted]#I have a very broad skillset in IT, and gave some specific ones i am interested in that I have experience with.  But even still if I am not currently qualified doesn't it still make sense to ask these questions to set up your career path?I realize there are lots of resources online but they aren't that great at the information I'm specifically trying to gather. Which basically boils down to ""between systems, network, and security, engineer or architect or analyst, or management, what pays the most in general and which has the highest earning potential""I have updated original post with additional context#I can take the pretax information and research my costs from there easier than I can compare post tax dollars.Job listings always show the pretax rate. They don't list jobs by post tax and expenses.  By contrast all of the other information for my budget are easy to research#I know they are lower than in the US. I'm not just looking for a money grab.I'm really trying to figure out if I should look for jobs as system engineer, system architect, security engineer or architect, network engineer or architect, or some sort of management role. I'm equally qualified in all those fields.I currently get 25 paid vacation days, 10 federal holidays, and an annual bonus almost equal to a months worth of work. No pension though, and my PTO would include sick time. I realize there are a number of other social benefits to account for as well.But while benefits help you within your own country, higher wages help you go anywhere. And a higher savings allows you more freedom in retirement#[deleted]#Yes#Thank you this is probably the most helpful so farDurchfire is a great link#I work in Zaandam and public transportation from Amsterdam to Zaandam is €84 per month. Unlimited travel by public transport in the entire country is €340 per month if you get a yearly subscription. Plus you can ask any employer in those fields to pay your travel costs, most will do so.If you want to buy a brand new car with a payment plan you'll get to €800 per month at a level just below luxury sedans. Leasing a Tesla will cost you €950-€1000 per month including all taxes and insurances. Pre-tax salaries are higher in the US, but there are a lot of hidden costs there and hidden benefits here that most people don't account for.That's why comparing salaries in widely different countries is pointless.#You are grossly overstating some figures.* I pay 100 euros for health insurance (dental included, I increased my own risk to max).* My mobile phone plan is 12 euros (for 25 euros you already get unlimited data with Tele2, if you are paying 40 euros you are with the wrong provider)* I absolutely don't spend 100 euros every single month buying clothes.* I don't have a car and nor do I ever plan on owning one (unless I move out of Amsterdam). And like another poster said, public transport is a lot cheaper than  you say.* I spend about 200 euros on groceries - for two people.FWIW, I used to make that same amount of salary - I easily saved almost 1500 to 2000 every month. I do have the 30% ruling, and without it the savings would be closer to 1000 a month.#[deleted]#You need to know the salaries to make sense of the difference in benefits though#Fact is that IT people in the US have a higher standard of living than in the Netherlands. American IT wages are insane. They don't have to be frugal.#[deleted]#\>I spend about 200 euros on groceries - for two people.can you describe how? We are 2 people and we both eat a lot of food and i find it impossible to get it below 350.#I pay 300/month for gas+elec. sucks.#The range seems to be larger. Average seems to be similar. And quality of life can vary wildly within the US#What do you think is a higher standard of living? As a software developer, I can easily afford to get a mortgage for a home inside the Amsterdam ring. I have job security working in this country. My health insurance isn't tied to my job. I get (at least) 25 vacation days a year. I have great work-life balance.If earning more money is a higher standard of living by your standards then this argument is futile.#Wrong, fact is a lot of IT people in the states have shit standard of living with the exception of a small percentage that actually earns a fair bit of change. A majority of IT jobs don't pay a lot here or there.However, with the right education you can still earn a pretty good salary here. Sure you could earn more in San Francisco but your cost of living will increase a lot of as well.   As someone who lives in Amsterdam, works in IT and does some specialized work i can tell you that there are jobs that will earn you a lot and provide you with a high standard of living.#I've read a lot of stories of people getting lower wages because their employer will say ""well you will get the 30%""It isn't like that benefit lasts forever anyway and if you start at a lower wage your raises never amount as high#We make a weekly plan for our meals and then buy what's needed. We waste very little food when we take into account leftovers from last week into the planning for next week. We choose from a bookmarked collection of 100 or so recipes so we still have a lot of variety in what we eat.#I love all the benefits you get in the Netherlands, but compared to other professions the pay for IT in the Netherlands is bad compared to the US.#[deleted]#If I may ask, how much is that is meat?  ..because I'm having trouble lowering my grocery amount I'm spending as well..#It varies, sometimes we have meat only once a week and other times we'll end up having meat almost the whole week.

I clearly remember many cases of the child badgering the parent for attention. ""What's this, why is that, why why why why."" Not something I hear anymore.#How does another family doing that effect you in any way, though? I definitely like to talk to who I'm with but sometimes I'll play games with my kids while we wait for our food and then we barely talk because we are stuffing our faces and it is still so nice to go out and eat.

I even silenced the phone. Level 100 sneak shot.#That was sad.#Big brain#heh ok boomer#Personally it helped me. It reminded me to actively interact with my kids whenever possible before it’s too late.

Get over yourself#that's creepy#At least you're aware it's weirdo thing to do, whether they knew you did it out not.#Watching other people play with their phones whilst surreptitiously taking a picture with your phone, then posting that picture to the internet with your phone, then replying to comments on that picture on the internet with your phone helped you remember you have kids? Okay, guy.*Oh for fuck's sake, you don't even have kids.#I don't think it's that dramatic dude. Sometimes you can all just relax but do it while physically together.Also, did you use your phone to take a photo of them? You should really be using your phone to interact with your own family and friends and leave other people alone while they're out with their family.#The response to this post shows how pervasive this shit is.#That's the most pretentious shit lmao get over yourself."

If anything they are learning even more how to harvest our data for financial and other gains. If anything it will just become more intense, evasive, apparent and intrusive.#Unless an EMP pulse comes along and destroys technology, it's nearly impossible to think of a scenario where large scale data collection will go away.  Data storage cost has never been cheaper while at the same time, there are more devices collecting data than ever before.  All feeding into an insatiable marketplace with new use cases for the data coming online all the time.#No, but it’s gonna feel like it.#I have been thinking with how much of big data is is centered around marketing, if one of the conglomerates  decides to scrap their ads for whatever reason, and business isn't negatively affected, it could cause the collapse of the  entire advertising economy#Data has a considerable value now. And even if consumers were to opt out like you said, they’d still be able to collect demographical data on you. There’s information warfare going on all around us now. And data collection will only get worse.#Disagree#Yes short these companies. It literally can't go tits up.#I haven't given the idea enough consideration yet to be honest, but I will try. I saw an article that claimed that the vast majority of consumers would opt out of allowing companies to sell their personal data if they were given the option. Where I feel it would become a bubble is if public opinion on this matter gets to a point where legislative branches of government decide to intervene by creating laws that provide consumers such an option. Many business have built this profit structure in to their business models and are likely relying on these returns. I couldn't provide numbers but I almost guarantee it's many billions of dollars. What happens when that stream of effortless income runs dry?#It was a question not a statement.#Unexpected r/wallstreetbets#I would say calling it a bubble would be inaccurate. In the event that legislature was passed that prevented companies from collecting personally identifying information, there would likely be a handful of small firms that would be absorbed by the larger ones, but Big Data is here to stay, regardless of what laws might be passed.The only info that would be protected would be your personal identifiers, name, address, DOB, SS#. All of the information about your viewing habits, preferences, purchases and traffic would all still be fair game. They would just assign an anonymized number to you and keep on collecting.#Very interesting, thanks. You may be right. I’ve been thinking about this topic lately, but more abstractly and focused on the relationship between the consumer, data, and brand. Haven’t put much thought into the market.I  don’t think data is necessarily in a bubble currently, but there could definitely be a huge crash. If so, there would be a domino effect — I would add diminished value of product and marketing to your theory, as they both often require accurate data.#Big, if true"
AusFinance;djx7h5;1571448867.0;/r/AusFinance/comments/djx7h5/helping_mil_out_with_finances/;Helping MIL out with finances;My in-laws (pensioners and seniors) are paying way, way too much for phones and probably a bunch of other stuff. I plan to sit down with her, go through anything she's willing to let me help with and find better deals. I'm hoping you guys can help with advice!I know she's paying $140/m for two phone plans with Telstra (they need the big T for reception in their area). No contract and handsets are owned outright (wtf!). They do need big data caps because they travel but I'm certain that can drop a ton.They have no home internet. I'd like them to get NBN. She's worried it'll be a sink cost when they're travelling weeks at a time, but I think they'll be ahead if they drop their top tier Foxtel plan and use streaming/Foxtel go. FIL wants full sport channels and possibly new though, so I will have to balance that carefully.I'm pretty sure they use that pensioner insurance co. I don't know if I'll be able to help there and I'm not really willing to touch it, in case I accidentally reccomend them a lower cover plan and something goes wrong. Are there any other areas I can check? Rebates that may apply? I'm not sure if they have it but I know there's a discount on power if you have medical needs. I think FIL will qualify (he has a ton of stuff wrong). They are of sound mind and not stupid people, I think it's just a case of having nightmare experiences with some companies when trying to get better rates.;Not an expert by any means, but great point to start with the mobiles. There are some great deals out there, do you have to stick to Telstra? Or could you use providers like ALDI who use the Telstra network? I use ALDI myself, and whilst it may or may not be the best deal, it's very cheap and easy to use. You could even use the data from the plan as a substitute for NBN if that's easier.Might I suggest Kayo for sports streaming? For 30 odd dollars a month they offer a lot of sports for around the world, if you're not sold on Foxtel.I think starting to talk about budgeting and saving money is the biggest and hardest step. I commend you for helping your in-laws.#Depending on what they get with their phones. $70/month each might not be too outrageous especially if they don't have a home internet plan. I'm not sure how they're on a plan with no contract. Generally that's what on a plan means. I think the biggest value areas for savings will come from insurances and utilities. Just be careful when messing with their health insurance since their in the age bracket when they are most likely to use it.Look for companies that offer seniors discounts, but make sure they're not just artificially marking up their product to compensate for any discounts.#Your biggest challenge will be trying to transition them from Foxtel into streaming. Even with smart TVs, that generation simply refuse to give up Foxtel in favour of streaming. My father did incredibly well in the IT sector for his entire life, and he still refuses to drop Foxtel. It defies logic to us, but I guess I understand the familiarity that comes with having TV channels.#For Telstra network I use Belong, they are reasonably priced and unused data does not expire, I've been with them for about half a year and have had no issues so far.#We ditched Foxtel and now use Kayo for sport.  Will probably shut down the sub after the RWC finishes in a couple of weeks.#What sports does the FIL usually watch? Because Kayo Sports starts at $25 p/m. Optus Sport is up to $20 p/m so there's heaps of alternatives. Foxtel is a waste to pay $150 p/m to watch the Nanny re-runs...#Boost uses the Telstra network $150 prepays 12 months, 80 gig download - [https://boost.com.au/shop/150-prepaid/](https://boost.com.au/shop/150-prepaid/), other plans available too.For insurance, have an honest discussion with them. Say you don't know a lot in that area, and you feel uncomfortable  however you have found different ones here for these reasons and leave it up to them to make a decision. If you haven't already sit down and do a budget, identify relative areas of costs. Electricity: do a power audit, buy a cheap $20 power meter wall plug and empower them with the information on how much things cost to power.. e.g. this oil heater costs $2 a night to run.. generally element type heaters are quite expensive, an efficient reverse cycle air con provide a lot of comfort and quality of life considering how much they cost to run. You can also buy a special type of power plug which has two sockets, when it detects the main socket is off, then it switches the other socket off too.. useful for computers + monitors, or tv's + appliances (beware foxtel box is a computer and requires safe shutdown)All in all, state what u can do, and why it might be able to help, when they both agree, go for it. Sometimes it might take a few years for them to get back to you regarding it. But theres no point forcing them onto anything, not worth it.#I've heard the sell on companies like Aldi get marginally worse reception when there is congestion? They live in a black hole with no landline so I don't want to risk that. Plus they're totally unwilling to give up their Bigpond email addresses 😂#I'm too scared to touch insurance! I have a feeling they'd qualify for disability rebates on power though. FIL has some chronic conditions. They are paying more for phones, for same data, as hubby and I are with two new phones! And I've heard even you can't find a better foxtel deal you can call and say you want to cancel, and they'll offer a better rate#Haha yeah. We might be able to drop to a lower package though.#It's weird since it's pretty much the same as streaming if you consider that Foxtel gets trasmitted via HFC.#Was 100% about to bring this up. Belong and boost are the closest companies to Telstra directly. Belong has 3 options - 40$ p/m for unlimited calls n text nationally/internationally and 30 gb of data that rolls over- 25$ p/m for unlimited calls n text nat and 10gb - $10 p/m for unlimited calls n text mat and 1gb All set up as prepaid but is linked with debit so it just takes it out when top up is needed. Some retailers like JB HI-FI (who is a Telstra dealer) often do half price off the $40 and $25 for first month (Only downside of belong is no main customer service, mostly done through emails sent to them)Telstra home internet for unlimited you’re looking at 90$ p/mOr for 200gb p/m is 75$ Or 100gb p/m is 70$ gb All casual plans BUT if I’m not mistake, If you cancel before 24 months you pay out modem. Check out Jb as they often have deals regarding first month free etc for the 90$ (this week they had a bonus TV when you signed up as new which ends today 20/10) Belong does home internet for unlimited $65 p/m, no home phone included though. And there’s more option to choose from#They're doing ok ATM so I figure starting with the low hanging fruit might be best. They're pretty power savvy buy haven't compared suppliers in a long time, so I'm gonna do that. I think their insurance is with APRA and I've heard they're really good.#Oh i just saw this. RIP. Understand if they like their bigpond email. Ring telstra and threaten to terminate.. goto the termination department, they will offer you a better deal..#Look into Boost Mobile. I’m with them and they use telstra’s network. Haven’t had any issues and annual prices are very reasonable!#[deleted]#[deleted]#Oh that's a great tip. Thank you!#Only downside with boost is lower bandwidth allocation or priority during  demand I believe. Peak hour train rides have very slow internet speed.#Even if they keep Telstra I could give them my old phone and they can use it as a backup hotspot, right? And drop their plans down to the $30-45 mark.#Telstra is such a bloody ripoff.#You shouldn't have any issues, but just make sure your old phone specs cover all the Telstra frequencies.

AcademicPsychology;dfay0s;1570589669.0;/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/dfay0s/looking_for_psychologists_who_use_data/;Looking for psychologists who use data science/machine learning in their research;I’m sitting on an offer for a data scientist position which would start next spring. This is my back-up plan to psychology research science. Professorship is the goal, but I don’t want to click around in SPSS doing t-tests for my whole career. Some scientists have done a lot of good with that method, and that’s okay. But modern technology is beginning to allow for some seriously amazing discoveries and innovations, and I’m surprised at how little I’m seeing the presence of machine learning in academic psychology- at least among professors who are still mentoring grad students. Can anyone point me towards some researchers who have been working with AI/big data/NLP/image processing?;"I would agree with you about SPSS and how there seems to be an overall lack of Data Science in psychology (broadly defined). I am currently in a clinical psychology program and have been pushing for using R with students and how things are being taught. Any changes in psychology are going  to be slow. There have been some advancements and improvements in how we analyze data with more and more people using structural equation modeling and finding some new ways to do that. Aiden Wright (at Pitt) is doing some cool stuff with multilevel modeling in an SEM framework. There has been a recent movement in clinical psychology to re-examine the overall structure of psychopathology. This has lead to using bi-factor modeling (look to Moffit & Caspi's paper on the p-factor) and more recently a hierarchical framework called Hi-TOP (which is mainly theoretical, but more people are putting data to it). One of the difficult things is recruiting large enough samples to be able to do things that you are talking about (at least within a clinical psych framework), but there are movements to change that (see things like the Psychological Accelerator and the Many Labs project). Additionally, outside of clinical, people are doing some really interesting stuff. One of the things that I am intrigued by is the ""multiverse"" analyses. Amy Orben (a grad student I think) examines the relationship between teen social media use and their well-being with a large dataset. The idea behind these analyses is to compute every single combination of the relations between all variables in a dataset and look at the effect sizes relative to one another. I think psychology is a little behind where it needs to be, but there are shifts happening (see things related to the replicability crisis) that are pushing people to share more data and be more transparent in what they are doing. But I think the field is going to take a while because the incentive structures are working against those innovations. I have other people who are doing cool analytic work and would be happy to share if you want! Additionally, I am sorry for not including links to everything. If anyone is interested in anything specifically, I can link to them. Happy to chat more if you want!#[deleted]#There's SO MANY professors studying big data and AI. Just google it. I don't know what you want to do exactly, so its hard to pinpoint just a few professors. There's reinforcement learning, causal learning, and much more. For both kids and adults. Or google ""neural networks psychology"", which is also super common now.  If you really like computers, you could try computational psychology/neuroscience. And SPSS is soon to be obsolete. R is free and so much better/more flexible. Also, sorry to disappoint you but research is not all amazing discoveries and innovations, even technological research. Rarely in research are there scientific ""breakthroughs"". Research is a slow arduous process. And it may seem common to me, because I'm studying these types of things as well. Another poster says there is a lack of data science in psychology, but there are a few psychology professors trying to change that. If you want to work with advanced technology, you can try human factors, too, but not all human factors is AI /machine learning.#There’s definitely a lot of professors at UCSD working with data science and machine learning. Virginia De Sa, Shannon Ellis, Brad Voytek, Ed Vul, Taylor Scott, David Kirsch, Jim Hollan, Don Normal, just to name a few#In my opinion, this is one of the major problems with Psychology. It has yet to embrace newer methodologies, translational research and methods that can at some point increase the expediency of providing direct care services#Yeah let’s have a big database for judging people’s brains, to figure how to drug them!

If you are intending to..Psychiatry is corrupted by chemical manufacture right now and it’s time immemorially wanting for honour.I think your morality is looking for neurologists.#Hey, thanks for those pointers!I didn't go into a lot of detail with my post because admissions questions are frowned upon here. I'm interested in exclusively clinical programs because I think it's important to have skills outside of just research  even though I want to be a professor/researcher primarily, I think it's unwise to commit to a 5-7 year program and not have any back up plan (practicing as a clinician is a great back-up plan if I struggle to find a good permanent fit in academia). It's kind of a bummer because that basically excludes all the work in experimental psych, but that's my decision. It's just been a tough search, because I'll find some research I think is cool, and then have to look up all the authors individually. You have to check if they are professors, what department they are in, if their university is realistic to apply to (I've got a strong application, but I'd still prefer not to bother with any top 10 programs or ivy league schools), and if by some miracle they happen to be a clinical mentor at a well-fitting university who regularly does this type of research, odds are they aren't taking on any grad students this year. That's been my experience so far. I'm very open to a wide range of topics. I love to program and am very skilled at R and python. I want to use and continue to develop these skills as a grad student in psychology. This is more important to me than the research topic itself  of course I will still have to read up on each professors' research to see if it interests me, it's just that I'm not limiting myself to one or two topics to begin with.I added Aiden Wright to my list, I agree that looks pretty cool. Don't worry about the links, I have Google. Thanks again for your reply and if it's no big deal I'd love to hear from you again if you're aware of anyone else who you think I should check out (clinical/statistics/cs).#Could you elaborate on the recent movement in clinical psychology to rexamine psychopathology? I am looking to go into clinical psychology but am myself skeptical of many of the prevailing methodologies and studies. As a result I'm really interested in models that go past simple significance testing, for example what you mentioned with multilevel modelling, or Bayesian analysis.I'm also interested in your flair ""Clinical/Community"". Could you explain to me this? Did you specificaly study community based treatments? I also have a big interest in critical community psychology (probably my second biggest interest) and if I could ever unify the two as a practitioner (if I'm eventually successful in my career path) that would be fantastic.#and that really is just a few!#Yeah I agree I think students sound embrace the interdisciplinary role psychology can play. its what's pushed academically too ,my uni had stats with SPSS with no programming like R. When I was looking to go into neuroscience they just kept telling me my math didnt have to go past stats and it's actually calc so I'm behind now for my MA but I'll get there.The two projects I was an RA for a few years looked at structural model predicting self realizationAnd path analysis predicting morally debatable behaviors.I finished my psychology BA and worked on my independent research prior, investigating spatial awareness. I presented at the first annual SVPA conference about my findings as the sole author it was a good feeling to see my labor and talk about the results.However, I was thinking about looking back at all my data and running tests on my data with a different program since I used SPSS ex. R or something for data analysis. Someone point me in the right direction lol#Based on some of the comments that you made, it might be good to look at more data science focused areas. Although R is growing as a statistical language, researchers are still set in their ways. And if you find someone, they are most likely going to be younger and will have the pressures of a tenure track position and pushing their students to publish a lot. I don't know how you feel about writing, but something to keep in mind that you will have to be doing on top of research, classes and clinical work. Clinical psychology seems to have the most amount of work (I am only comparing this to my own program and knowing students in other areas). An area that I have found very interesting is related to Open Science practices and looking at what they are doing. Some other people that I have enjoyed reading and seeing what they do are: Kevin King, Jennifer Tackett, Brian Nosek (founder of COS), Eiko Fried (network models), Aaron Fisher, Michele Nuijten, James Heathers. I am a big fan of R, and have been trying to get more into python. Do you have any suggestions? Happy to chat more as well if you would like!#There seems to be a general understanding throughout clinical psychology that the DSM/ICD doesn't do a good job at identifying the heterogeneity of experiences by placing categories on what is inherently dimensional. A good example is the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. The DSM states that an individual needs 5 criterial symptoms, but what if a patient has 4? Who is to say that their distress isn't as impairing as someone with 5? [Caspi et al (2014)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2167702613497473?casa_token=MytKaUQhke0AAAAA%3AxJlAPc-OiJFrE2-sOYlKi_8RR2e4ff9cTD8WIdXa4_wBvGqZluK0S5T8vRhO1HvH6BACriuAsRXPJQ&) identified a general P-factor using bi-factor modeling. Suggesting that there may be an overall risk for broad psychopathology and maybe that is what we should be looking at. More recently a group of researchers has identified an alternate configuration [(Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology - HiToP)](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/abn-abn0000258.pdf). I think you are correct in having skepticism as psychology more broadly has entered a ""replication crisis"". This is because many researchers fail to be transparent in their practices or methodologies. Fortunately, clinical psychology is doing better than other divisions of psychology (see [Reardon et al. about n-pact factor](https://psyarxiv.com/4fybk/)). A way that you can be more confident with research is looking for those who pre-register (through OSF), or are proponents of open science practices. And I am currently in a program that has both clinical and community psychology. We receive training in both areas, but there is an emphasis on clinical. The community aspect is examining the systems associated with mental health, or communities more broadly (examining the makeup of neighborhoods and how they are designed as a way to promote mental health). I have begun to realize that a lot of what I would like to do is more community focused than I previously thought. I would like to be able to provide systems level support for the examination of psychopathology. There are few programs that attempt to bridge clinical and community, and some do it better than others. I know that was a long reply, and I probably missed some things. Let me know if you have other questions! I would be happy to chat more. You can private message if you want, or reply here.#Thanks again for the suggestions. I don't mind writing, I've already published a few psychology papers. I know what to expect in the clinical psych route, and honestly there are a lot of pros and cons for pursing either data science or the psych PhD. I have a great data science job lined up (waiting on a security clearance) which I will take unless I find a psychology mentor who is a perfect fit and will allow me to combine the two fields. R is amazing and my personal favorite. I only learned it because it's nearly impossible to get a job in data science if you don't know R, Python, and SQL. Besides personal preferences, the main objective reason to learn python over R would be their slightly more capable machine learning libraries. You should check out Andrew Ng's Machine learning course on Coursera.#Thanks for the reply!This makes a lot of sense. One of my undergraduate assignments was assessing the validity of the disease model for psychopathology. It made me aware of how widespread criticism of the model is even amongst clinical psychologists. For example the Division of Clinical Psychologists here in the UK has made a statement urging for a paradigm shift away from the model, rejecting the increasing ties between the DSM and pharmaceutical interventions or understandings. Am I right in understanding these criticisms are similarly shared and widespread across the pond in the U.S?Your program sounds really cool! The path to becoming a clinical psychologist here is a bit different, but I'm very passionate about the potential for community psychology to mobilise people and benefit mental health amongst other outcomes. Are you familiar with the work by Prilleltensky?"
algotrading;dlfujr;1571739315.0;/r/algotrading/comments/dlfujr/a_performant_backtesting_system/;A performant backtesting system?;"Hi,I'm a beginner in quantitive trading trying to build my setup for backtesting and optimizing strategies.For quite some time I've been playing around with [Backtrader](https://www.backtrader.com) which is written in Python. After reading ""Building Winning Algorithmic Trading Systems"" book I've tried to implement a walk-forward analysis in Backtrader and load some real data from Binance.A case was loading 1 year of 15m data from 77 markets. In total it is \~1.6m candles. The reason I add that much data is that I want as real & thorough simulation as possible before I let the strategy work with the real money. Backtrader wasn't able to even iterate through the data w/o indicator calculation. I've tried to use Jython and PyPy to speed things up, but that didn't help.I've started implementing my own backtesting system designed after Backtrader (at least top-level API) in C++17. From the very beginning, it became clear that a pile of subtleties is higher than the sky (commissions, slippage, position tracking, complex order types (bracketed, trailing, ...), synchronous data iteration, making sure there's no look-ahead bias, ....).At this point, I understand that to get some properly working usable prototype I'll have to spend 2-3 months of time on that thing. And that'll be the very first step.So before jumping into that one I've compiled a list of requirements and look around for anything matching:* C++ / Python API* Runs on Linux* Able to work fast with big data sets (4+G)* Able to load data from files (not married with some online services, I'll provide the data)* Parameter optimization (brute force, some genetic algorithms with annealing, LMA, ... more is better here)* Walk-forward out of the box* Monte Carlo and other risk estimations* Usual strategy metrics (max drawdown, net/gross profit, commissions calculations, won/lost orders, Sharpe ratio, ...)* Costs some sane amount of $$$I've googled and found only [QuantConnect Lean](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean) engine, but it lacks documentation and even after I've managed to load all the data into it it was pretty slow. Also, there's [gobacktest](https://github.com/dirkolbrich/gobacktest) that looks promising, but I didn't get there yet.Are there any other products I'm missing?Thanks!P. S. My plan B is moving to Windows and subscribing to MultiCharts (along with learning C#), but that's the last resort.";"Aren't we all beginners in `quantum trading`#Zorro#The closest thing I can think of is Lean. At least open source, anyway.Tbh you’re going to be better off building your own. It’s a huge PITA laying the groundwork, but the benefits are that you have an intimate understanding of every single calculation, bottleneck, assumption, and potential bias. Plus you might learn a new thing or two along the way.#From all the requirements you list, it seems running on Linux might be the toughest. I am maintaining my own backtesting engine, and even though it is coded in C# (which in theory is cross-platform), there are ultimately a lot of Windows dependencies. For the pure backtesting engine, these are mainly introduced by the data feeds, and for the application by the UI toolkit.I have started working on my own engine after becoming frustrated with MultiCharts. I used MultiCharts for 5 years. It is very well maintained, they add great new features with every release, and they typically fix the most annoying bugs. The design works very well for strategies running on single assets, or independent baskets of strategies. However, I found the architecture to have many painful issues when it comes to true portfolio strategies requiring back and forth communication between an overarching portfolio/ money-management and a number of child strategies. Your mileage may vary. If you still consider buying MultiCharts, watch out for Black Friday deals.Cheers!#Good question. Interesting topic. I don't have any answers though. I know what you're talking about when you say all the subtleties when creating your own. I'm working on one in C# for Windows right now. I'll let you know if it turns out to be state of the art haham#Interesting thread! I'm the founder of QuantConnect. We are constantly working on speed but the speed depends on what the algorithm is going. Depending on what you're doing it can range from 10k/sec up to 800k/sec with options data. The more ""dense"" the data, the faster in ""candles/points"" it benchmarks but we're well on our way to 1M events a second. I'd recommend against the C++ route! You'd be better to use LEAN-C# if speed is your first concern.#2-3 years is more realistic...#Thanks, fixed. Though it's not that futuristic now :D#This#Zorro is great but it's Windows. Running under Wine didn't work properly last time I checked (half-year ago).#A curiosity q:* What's the planned amount of data you want to process?* How do you load data? I'm using a prepared column-oriented binary data file format that is being mapped to virtual address space (file mapping) directly. Not sure if that can be easily achieved in .NET as it is still a virtual machine (roughly speaking).* Did you reverse engineer some other system or do you use some guidelines for implementing order & commission rules?#What are the benefits of linux over windows in the context of trading?#It's free. Can run on ARM platforms. Can be set up to use less system resources. So all this can result in cost savings since you can run it on a weaker platform, either at home or in the cloud. If running in the cloud, half of your cost will probably be just the Windows license. I'm not sure about scriptability of Windows, like setting things to run automatically at certain times. Buy I'm sure it can be done. Also, I've heard that Windows is getting a full Linux kernel so if cost isn't an issue, you can get the best of both worlds."

investing;df4fa1;1570560994.0;/r/investing/comments/df4fa1/splunk_financials_and_underlying_story/;Splunk Financials and Underlying Story;"Following my last post, I received a request to take a deeper dive into Splunk (SPLK), a rapidly growing company in the IT Operations Management (ITOM) space. One quick note before I kick off, I might reorganize these posts just to give them a bit more structure, which may evolve as time goes on.**Industry**Splunk fits within an interesting niche of the ITOM space. Their specialization is part of an area focused on machine learning and big data for logging, monitoring, and reporting IT Operations. To quote from [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3892967?ref=mrktg-srch) and [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/01/09/the-big-problem-with-big-data/#4d89199723b1), ""By 2022, 40% of all large enterprises will combine big data and machine learning functionality to support and partially replace monitoring, service desk and automation processes and tasks."" Given the upside, there are a ton of [vendors](https://blog.opsramp.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog_images/AIOps%20Vendor%20Landscape@2x-100.jpg?width=3840&name=AIOps%20Vendor%20Landscape@2x-100.jpg) craming into a very crowded market. In [Gartner's](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3939625/market-share-analysis-itom-performance-analysis-software) most recent report, the market size is $5.2B and grew at 12% YoY, also [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190423005350/en/Splunk-Increases-Market-Share-Gartner’s-Performance-Analysis). **Revenue**For Splunk, their (reported) revenue is broken down into 3 main categories: Licensing, Maintenance and Services, and Cloud. The License line is a one-time payment for a perpetual license for on-premise deployment of the Splunk Enterprise suite, while the maintenance and service and cloud license pay an annual subscription fee, which is tiered based on the amount of data ingested. Their revenue is rapidly transitioning from the perpetual license to the their annual subscription as they said in their most recent [earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/08/22/splunk-inc-splk-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx) ""We expect the elimination of perpetual license sales will accelerate renewable mix to 99% in Q4 and high 90s for the full-year."" [seen here](https://imgur.com/CX7RqQ).This transition has a bit of uncertainty around it. Exabeam, one of Splunk's competitors in the SIEM space, recently [mentioned](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2019/06/14/exabeams-fast-growth-not-slowing-down-splunk/#70e6bad1c36b) that customers are unable to predict their expenditure since Splunk prices based on data ingested, which can be a varying target. Additionally, the cloud transition provides a more sticky cash flow for the company, but will provide short-term pain since the amounts are billed annually vs. entirely upfront. While this might help customers from an initial expenditure outlay (potentially removing one of the roadblocks), it is the reason that Splunk recently revised their cash flow forecast from a positive $250mm inflow to a negative $300mm outflow (despite raising annual guidance from $2.25B to $2.3B). The critical KPI for the company here is their [Remaining Performance Obligations](https://investors.splunk.com/static-files/4333fe85-6fc8-40cc-b56d-60e4527281cb), which is non-cancellable (future) contracted revenue. In 2Q20, the RPO was [$1.235B](https://imgur.com/pr7Rxh7), with 61% of that to be recognized over the next twelve months ($753mm). The average contract duration for the contracts signed have hovered just shy of 3 years (33 months). One concerning metric in their most recent quarter was that the contract bookings slowed dramatically in the most recent quarter, $554mm, which is only a 19% growth rate.Finally, Splunk just [closed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000141057819001502/tv530497_8k.htm) on their acquisition of SignalFX on October 1st, so guidance and RPO will likely look dramatically different in Q3 and Q4 as the company represents a combined platform.**Costs**From a cost perspective, the company's costs have stayed broadly consistent with [topline growth](https://imgur.com/hOrLe5P). On an LTM basis, the company has ~$1.8B of expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles. The number of employees has grown from 2,700, to 3,200, to 4,400, to 4,700 from Jan-2017, Jan-2018, to Jan-2019, and today respectively. Assuming an average total compensation of [$261,231](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000120677419001555/splk3465081-def14a.htm#CEOPayRatio), accounts for ~$1.15B of those expenses or ~72% for FY19. This has remained relatively constant for 2015 to current.As a result, cloud margins are improving, as 2Q20 reached a 50% margin, nearing their 70% gross margin target. Research and Development has remained relatively constant at 15 - 17.5% of sales, sales and marketing at 45% - 50% of sales, and G&A at ~10% of sales. These percentages strip out stock-based compensation, but since there is no breakdown, still include D&A. **Capitalization**Splunk is well funded with 2 convertible senior notes (convertible at $148.30) for a total debt of $2.1B, but has $2.7B in cash and investments. This gives the company a great war-chest to continue to acquire companies in the space. The company has acquired [7 companies](https://imgur.com/xW8hmli) in the past 2 years, with the most notable being SignalFX, augmenting their suite of products in the monitoring segment. **Returns**Over the last 4 - 5 quarters, Splunk's return on capital has settled into the [5 - 10% range](https://imgur.com/hOrLe5P). Given their reinvestment rate of ~150% (math from [here on p 26](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/ovhds/dam2ed/growthandtermvalue.pdf)), this implies a sustainable EBIT growth rate of 7 - 10%. To me, this passes the smell test since it's broadly consistent with the industry growth predicted by IDC and Gartner, implying that Splunk's organic revenue growth will continue and acquisitions should provide further juice to the topline growth rate. **Outlook**Splunk issued guidance of $2.3B for FY2020, with $600mm in Q3 (implying ~$760mm in Q4). Wall street is right in line with guidance for 2020, and showing $2.8B for 2021 (or a 22% growth rate). The challenge for the company will be to weather the transition from the upfront payment to the cloud subscriptions, since that will depress cash flow for the next year or two. The company even noted on their last [earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/08/22/splunk-inc-splk-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx) that their target cash flow yield won't be realized until after 2021.TL DR Splunk is a rapidly growing player in the IT Operations Management space that is growing dramatically and starting the shift into turning their revenue stream into longer-term contracts. As the company transitions, it will depress cash flow in the near-term, but could accelerate onboarding as it manages the initial expense outlay for customers. Images [here](https://imgur.com/a/YvuAVhI). As per usual excel available if requested.Excel [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pz61bn0029rpg3k/SPLK.xlsx?dl=0)";As someone that works with SIEM and other tools in this space, splunks new licensing model is an untenable solution for rapidly growing businesses, and businesses that are watching their bottom line. They've had a monopoly in the SIEM space for the past few years, but with elastic's offerings, and google getting into the space with backstory, both being at much more competitive price points, I'd say that  things are going to start swinging against splunk.#elasticsearch#> elasticsearchI came across them in my research for this. They were referenced in a number of places. The only reason I haven't called them out as much is because Splunk has revenues around $2.0B, while Elastic for FY19 (ended April) was only $271mm, nearly 7.5x bigger than them (and RPO of $1.235B vs. $352.5mm). They compete specifically in the big data area, while Splunk also references BMC Software, Micro Focus, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, and VMware as competitors.#I have a buddy working with elasticsearch right now.  Big difference I can tell is splunk would be ready to go out of the box probably within a week.  With elasticsearch, they are manually translating and parsing a bunch of stuff constantly and I can't see how it pays for itself with the extreme amount of labor required to put into it.#Can you please share  splunk excel? Thanks.
AUfrugal;djxiyb;1571450627.0;/r/AUfrugal/comments/djxiyb/telstra_mobile_foxtel_and_nbn/;Telstra Mobile, Foxtel and NBN;I'm going to MIL's this week to try and find better deals for them on the above.  They NEED to have mobiles with Telstra for reception and to keep their ancient email addresses. They travel, so need big data caps. Phones are owned outright.FIL won't budge on Fox sport and news (unless there's a streaming option maybe? But their tv is 20 odd years old, no way to connect it. He'd have to watch on iPad or mobile so that's unsure.) They enjoy a lot of BBC series type stuff, some docos, some lifestyle (like building and cooking, not reality drama) together. They have kids for our kids but that's 100% not necessary.They have no home internet. TPG have a $30 deal. I feel this would allow them to possibly reduce Foxtel spend by adding streaming options, and reduce phone cap needed, or let them vary it month by month. They need big caps when travelling in their caravan, up to a couple months at a time. MIL is resistant because they won't use the NBN while travelling. It's HAVE to bring overall cost down to convince her. They would LOOOOVE a ton of Netflix and Prime shows though! I've looked at deals and it's so confusing! JB HIFI have way better Telstra deals than Telstra online, but I've phoned Telstra before and they matched a JB deal with an extra 5% off. They are pensioners and seniors, if that helps?;"Foxtel Now works with Chromecast or a Foxtel Now Box and there's PLENTY of kids content on ABC iView.Edit: Netflix isn't officially supported on the Foxtel Now Box.#The best deals you will get through Foxtel at the moment involve calling up and cancelling due to the high costs. They are struggling at the moment to retain customers with the industry disrupters like Netflix. I regularly ""cancel"" with them and have been on my current package of $29 per month for basic + sport + HD for 2 years. They might not give you a deal that good in the first round but you can certainly get them to lower their price simply by telling them you are looking to disconnect and telling them it's due to the price and you are looking at cheaper alternatives.   Telstra seems to give the better deals online, rather than through their phone or shop fronts. They aren't as good as resellers of other carriers price wise but have a look online and see if you can get into some live chat and tell the operator you are looking at this deal \[insert competitior\] is offering and wondered if they could lower their \[x plan\] to be more competitive.&#x200B NBN is a hard one.. sometimes you pay for what you get as a fair few ISP's oversubscribe. If they don't need fast internet though it's pretty hard to beat TPG's pricing.#Kayo is cheaper than foxtel for sports. So if you can sort out the news they like to watch, and their TV that's an option. You'll likely never get a ""great"" deal on telstra stuff but if they have an ipad with sim card prepaid stuff can have pretty big bonus data. Alternatively dual sim phone's are an option for the future (and in my experience cheaper than aussie version. Get them off ebay).Sadly though you'll never save much money with such a long list of ""must have"" stuff. If they can live without having data *everywhere* they travel they'll get better deals. If they figure out a better way to get their news they can save a lot by using kayo or depending on what sports they want to watch there's stuff like telstra nrl app to stream. If they have 2 phones they can always use one on telstra with cheap unlimited calls and another carrier on the other for big cheap data. If they don't update their TV though there's a lot of cheaper options they'll miss out on. Might be worth pointing out that (depending on size) they could save more money long term by buying a cheap TV now (gumtree will have plenty).#JB Hi fi often do mobile deals for SIM only plans, $500 gift card for port in customers, 65pm, 60gb data. If your number is with Telstra, port out to Vodafone and apply for port in to telstra using in HIFI. Vodafone is cheapest nbn, I personally use Aussie broadband, and ex telstra combo for telstra so it's only 35, uncoupled from bundle (I just put a formal.complaint in for the etcs)#Go with Aldi for mobiles, cheaper than, but still uses Telstra :)#Can they pay Telstra to keep their emails (I know some other providers allow you to pay $5 a month or so to do so after leaving)? Their plans are incredibly expensive and boost use the same network at a fraction of the cost.#My 85 year old dad had a bigpond email for years, now he’s got a gmail one.It actually wasn’t as much of a drama as you think it’ll be. Start the change now, email everyone they know that the new address is xxx and the old won’t work soon.  And send new updates a week later from the new address etc and it will be sorted. Telstra has Belong for mobiles and broadband so is an option. Fox sports can be streaming now but not as easy for older people to use, satellite it better for them and can watch all channels on one box and record stuff they like. Chat online and see what deal they can do, so you have a base line at least on cost.Geez, just checked Telstra Sim only plans, wow they have shot up in price. Im with Telstra and I pay $34 for 30gig data, unlimited (albeit slower) data after that. Now 15gig is $50!!!#I'm not sure what fox box they have. It's a normal dish service I think? The tv had no HDMI or USB points. If we can find a good deal we might get them one for Christmas though.#You have to be off the Telstra network for 30 days before you can port back in (unless you get lucky and they don’t check your previous stuff which is unlikely)#They use telstra wholesale network which isn't as good for reception and speeds. Boost is the only one IIRC that uses the retail network (full network). Boost's  plans aren't bad though (especially prepaid).#I think the biggest drawback is that FIL still gets emails from companies and people he doesn't know asking him to do work for them. Sometimes he helps out free, other times he takes paid work. Many of these people got his email from a guy who got it from a guy... And he's worried changing emails will lose that potential.#Sometimes you have to spend money to save money.  A new TV with HDMI will not be a big expense in the grand scheme of things, especially when you factor in their 20 year old TV is probably consuming 5x more power than a similarly sized new one.[40"" 1080p for $200](https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/soniq_australia-soniq-e-series-40-full-hd-ledlcd-tve40fv17a-nz-e40fv17a-nz/).[50"" 4K for under $400](https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/kogan-50-4k-hdr-led-tv-series-8-ju8100/).#Ahh, no HDMI is limiting.#That’s true, I live semi rural and have never had an issue where other carriers do, it will really depend on where they live!#They should be able to keep the email as it’s their email for their Telstra account (phone accounts) not just an email for broadband. Telstra give you an email address with an account. Double check though. Stay with Telstra for mobiles (understandable for reception), broadband and foxtel is not going to be cheap.What do they pay for their mobiles now, how much data? (And check accounts, how much data do they use, not just pay for)#Did you sort something?Maybe try ozbargain or whirlpool websites for this."

I have seen people go from SE to sales, but it starts with a move within the same company where they have the relationships to pull it off.  Once proven, you can then jump ship and having both sales and SE on the resume will be a great look.  Depending on your company that may require a short term step back in base at least, and maybe total OTE.  Up to you if you believe in yourself and want it bad enough to take that risk.#Most companies don’t advertise for above and beyond. My OTE has always been lower than what I’ve actually made. Most people on here posting that they’re making 200k+ are not your average worker. There are plenty of people in my office who put in the bare minimum and are ok with their base and low % of commission.

Both of these are especially helpful if you are going to make the move within your current company.1. Take advantage of the fact that you are supporting sales reps now, and when you are working with them observe their behavior.  What do the good reps do that make them successful?  Why do the bad reps fail?2. Know your blind spots and improve upon them.  Out of the gate you will undoubtedly know more about the technical aspects and products than any reps on your team, so focus your time on improving areas where you will be behind.  The two areas of focus I have seen SEs making the switch struggle with are prospecting and business qualifying questions (budget, authority and timeline).  Read up on sales methodologies and find a way to turn the areas where you do not have experience into strengths.#Field sales roles will pay 200k+ ote, and those exist in most places.  Yes he’s not struggling, but he’s allowed to ask the question.#So he wants an extra 20 to 30k and that is exactly my point.  Make the money you have work FOR YOU when you are in such a crazy COL in this moment (all things change).  This dummy needs to be entrepreneurial and learn to invest.  180k in AZ and looking to jump ship? Absurd.#This person is probably making 180k on an OTE less than that.  Enterprise field sales will be more like 230-270k OTE.  So if you have a p-club year, you’re over 300k.

The technology is integrated with others, such as big data and artificial intelligence, to build a national surveillance and data-sharing platform.* In 2019, China announced that the third generation of Resident Identity Cards will be able to trace location.

This is because the Chinese model is more beneficial to those in power.> Compared to other countries (or at least other high income democracies), can you see the United States being more like China in this aspect as time goes on? If so, what ""Techno-Police-State"" things can you see the United States doing?Yes, very much so. Privacy laws aren't keeping pace with technology, so dystopian things like excessive surveillance are unfortunately to be expected. That said, I don't think the US or any other Western democracy will be quite as *blatant* and authoritarian as China, but you're insane if you think there's no mass surveillance in Western society.> Can you see the world as a whole being more like China in this aspect as time goes on?Yes. As technology continues to advance, and society starts feeling the strain from climate change, governments are going to need better means of controlling its citizens, which said technology will provide. It will seem dystopian to us, but not necessarily to those who grow up in it.It's unfortunate, and it's a great fear of mine, but that's my opinion on where the world is headed.#America would never mass-spy on its own citizens...  )#All of them, eventually. Most of this stuff we already do in the US on some level as well  China is just more blunt about it.#Welcome to the Good ole US of A, where we do not have a police state. No sirree#It's pretty much inevitable that all the authoritarian governments will adopt similar technology.It's also pretty much inevitable that all the democratic governments will \*also\* adopt this technology, just in private, among partnerships and contracts between a small number of dominant firms.#All countries to some extent. In the developed world I think the country that will go for this will be the UK. They already have in place things that would not fly in most modern democracies.I think the situation will get worse if the leave the EU. If northern Ireland and Scotland leave the UK, things will get ugly.#Yes, the US#> This is because the Chinese model is more beneficial to those in power.Do you think that China could implement the technology in certain developing nations with leaders loyal and friendly to China? So that the leaders that benefit them can stay in power and that there's less of a risk that a China unfriendly leader happens through the population rising up and forcing them out.#>because China is showing said nations there's an alternative means of industrializing other than modeling yourself on Western democracy. This is because the Chinese model is more beneficial to those in power.This is perceptive.To be clear, I'm no tankie apologist.But the upside of authoritarianism is that you can make very rapid change. The downside is decisions about what change to make become centralized in some fool like Mao, in which case you make very bad changes very fast at scale.Singapore remains this singular example of how authoritarianism can be somewhat more compatible liberal values from one vantage, but only in the sense that they got lucky with a central person that was a bit smarter and slightly more humane.#Please there’s a huge gap between the two#Please don’t draw a false equivalence between us and the PRC. We do bad things, they do bad things, but theirs are far worse on an order of magnitude.#Could you be more specific about the UK?  I know they have lots of CCTV, but is there anything else?#Huawei and their equivalents have built much of the modern communications infrastructure across Africa. This is just a small but particularly effective facet of their overall strategy, which has been to secure substantial ownership throughout Africa.#Exactly correct.#Buying porn licenses at the store"

Will it?;Let me just get this out of the way, I hate Facebook.  It's been a couple of years since I've purged my information from that cesspool.  However, I have to be honest when I say I do miss connecting with people in that convenient manner.  But I will not sacrifice my personal data or my privacy for their monetary gain.  Has Eich ever talked about launching a privacy centric social media platform that could possibly have BAT as a build in currency for tipping, ad revenue and purchases etc?  Someone has to challenge the cyber retardation that is Facebook.  Shit is getting out of control.  I get that it's hard to stop the Big Data machine and that private data is now worth just about as much as oil.  But goddamn, wouldn't it be nice to have a choice?;"The comments from Brendan around social and email have been “can’t build Rome in a day” but I do believe the aspirations are there.#First, make brave full complete(1.0) and Im okay with privacy chat, privacy social media, privacy pizza hut, etc...#I know 4chan isn't very popular on this website, but I'm dying for a crypto-focused anonymous imageboard where users can send and receive BAT, completely anonymously. There are obvious difficulties surrounding the idea but the potential is there.#Self promotion here but I think it's relevant. We are building [www.publish0x.com](https://www.publish0x.com) , it is modelled after Medium/Steemit style rather than facebook if you like - crypto content/blogging with tipping - but our tips are in 3 tokens currently with an 80% chance of the (free) tip you generate (for yourself and the author) being BAT! Personally I am a very big BAT/Brave fan and think it is a good fit, and we are not funded/endorsed/sponsored by Brave in any way, but we are starting to chat to them and hope to further BAT-ify. Possibly * Give higher rewards for visiting using the Brave Browser.* Filtering down your share of BAT contributions ala Youtube style to our authors/users.* *\* both of these things need permission / a little extra coding help from Brave themselves, and I understand they have higher traffic sites/partners to integrate with first but we are growing so I hope we make the list :P*Also would like to add disclaimers that * we are centralised (but then so is the Brave browser)* Our tips/transactions are NOT onchain, i.e each individual tip instance isnt, but again it is a weekly withdrawal batch payment onchain - again similar to BAT via Uphold monthly batching.* Again, want to make clear that we are centralised, and NOT a ""dapp"", it's the fastest way to build - build first and ""dapp-ify"" later and integrate with various projects who let us  do kyc, stamp content to their blockchain, host videos decentralised, etc.#Check out Holochain#This is dope#I so feel like BAT should be built on Holochain instead of an ERC20 token. I wonder if the devs have looked into this... 🤔#Yeah I also feel like it should be built on Tron. Wonder if the team had ever thought about this#BAT should be built on Aeternity.

With the advancement of blockchain technology, many industries are closely watching the benefits that blockchain can provide for them as new developments make blockchain more feasible for contemporary applications. The process to upgrade legacy systems in various industries as big data becomes increasingly important marks a huge technological turning point for our society. These industries involve major sectors in the world’s economy such as finance, education, and health care, to name a few. Within this article, we’ll delve into the benefits that blockchain can provide for the healthcare industry in particular.***Application of Blockchain to the Healthcare Industry***Healthcare is a field that is developing more than ever before, with a huge influx of IT infrastructure in the market to help doctors and nurses perform their jobs more efficiently and ensure patient health management at a superior level. With personal health records, medical drugs and instruments, hospitals and clinics have an ever-growing list of new things to keep track of and learn from. This increase of information derives the need for a data management system for hospital workers to access, edit, and extrapolate data in a fast and efficient way. Blockchain has a lot of qualities to make these information exchanges more secure, efficient, and interoperable.Focusing on quality health care services means creating a superior health management standard at all times. There are constant improvements needed with many hospitals running on older legacy systems. These technical inefficiencies can cost doctors and nurses valuable time and resources.***How a Third-Generation Blockchain Like Cardano Can Offer Benefits for the Healthcare Industry***Multiple variables come into play in patient care. With the advent of blockchain technology, medical workers are able to get near real-time updates across an information network for all parties involved in the provision of healthcare services. Identity verification and stored patient data can quickly pull up a patient's health history to determine the best course of action.&#x200B **\*\***[**Continue reading on our website**](https://emurgo.io/en/blog/blockchain-benefits-for-healthcare/newsletter);

Find a couple smart college kids as interns that know python and explore the variety of python libraries (scikit, numpy, pandas) or the various other open source things out there provided by folks like linked in, Facebook, Lyft, Netflix, etc.  freely available algorithms like FB prophet and things like that before you spend money on a bunch of buzzwords like “data scientist” and “ Hadoop” among other things that a majority of companies don’t really need.#Yes it is. But Most companies don’t need it and it is a dying technology. Just ask Hortonworks. Most use cases can be handled with emr using s3 and spark.  Little to know knowledge of Hadoop is required. Hadoop administration is a TON of work and is why many have moved away from it unless you are already stuck with it and it have a lot of money to support all of the hardware.#I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:- [/r/dataanalytics] [7 Steps To Prepare A Business For Big Data](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalytics/comments/dtbgh3/7_steps_to_prepare_a_business_for_big_data/)&nbsp *^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*#Hadoop is not a buzzword. It is a very concrete piece of software.#It's just that Pandas, and big data, or anything that seems big for that matter, just don't go well together.#There are plenty of options. Hadoop is not synonymous with big data these days. Most companies I come across that 5 years would have been looking at Hadoop do not need to.  That is my point. The ecosystem of Hadoop is dead. You can pick and choose your parts if needed.My other point is that a TON companies think they have big data merely because it is log data or non traditionally structured. In 5 years non of the stuff being pulled from system will be structured traditionally. Logs in Apache format, api call returning JSON, etc. all of those things were “non structured data” and what as indication of “big data”. That is bullshit and what cloudera and Hortonworks wanted you to think and therefore by. Plenty of things scale these days. Hadoop is not a requirement and if it is a scaled down style like emr that is one thing. Most times that is not required either. No need for Hadoop with yarn, hive (using tez or some other crap that performs like garbage), Hbase (pick any stand alone nosql of your choice, etc.   these days compute is pretty crazy and storage is cheap. No need for the old monolithic Hadoop type systems. Every company I see with them now is because they are stuck with them because they are legacy (been around a while and we converted from an original pig set up) or they have enough money to just Keep throwing money at it. No new development is going on hadoop stuff.  Not that makes it to production.#Ok. ... Sure... But this was about Pandas :)Try to load the classic 200GB of sales data and match it with 300GB of marketing data in Pandas.You could do that, with some tinkering, on a medium size server running Postgresql. You can do that without worry on cloud databases like snowflake. Pandas doesn't work well for medium sized data. That was my point.As for big data: it's a mess right now anyway, with tons of technologies that are non-standard, with tons of flaws. May Odin have mercy on the companies that opt for ""big data"" solutions that isn't just a docker container processing streaming data and showing statistics for 2 days max."
privacy;djn128;1571402934.0;/r/privacy/comments/djn128/why_do_americans_not_care_about_privacy/;Why do Americans not care about privacy?;I have the general idea of Americans, that they don't really care about internet privacy, especially when it comes to rights to their own images. Even on platforms as reddit, where one would think users in general have a broader consciousness about privacy, surveilance and big data, people constantly upload pitcures and videos of them, family members, friends and strangers or talk about sensitive private informations. Even more upsetting is the trend towards smart home gadgets, like Alexa etc. where companies directly (and proven in lots of cases) spy on you.As I write this text I am aware of the fact, that even with multiple add-ons (eg script blocker, cookie delete etc.) and VPN I leave traces online. Also I know, that one has to trade private data for comfort (eg smartphones  I feel bad about this specific matter btw). And also I realize that most people in Europe don't really care about privacy (so no 'superiority' here). But I have the feeling that most Americans care even less, as the mentioned limitless data-collection, both state- and commercial-wise, aren't really a matter of public discourse (or am I wrong ?).;"It's not just Americans, it's everyone. An overwhelming majority of people do not understand technology, others just think the convenience is worth the price.#This mentality exists not just in America. It's everywhere.As for why, I believe it's a combination of ignorance, being conditioned by the modern media/Governments to give up privacy because ""save the children"" and ""for the fight against terrorism,"" and because people have become accustomed to giving up privacy to services like Facebook because it's free (as in no financial cost to join).#We Americans are trained from a young age to be perfect consumers. A large demographic here also has been trained their entire life to be state dependent. To put it bluntly we are lazy and so long as we get the fun mind numbing distraction that’s offered free/cheap we, as a whole, don’t care the cost.#People have way too many other things to worry about. Paying bills, making sure they can afford healthcare, making sure they can afford food for their families. Most people just don't have the mental space to care about it. The time they spend on the internet is time for them to relax and not worry about things. I agree that they SHOULD be worrying about it. But, unfortunately, this is the end result of late stage capitalism. It's stressful for people who aren't well off. And that stress means they don't have the energy to care about relatively niche concerns.#As an American I agree with you.  When I talk about why I don’t share certain images and why I avoid certain websites people look at me like I’ve grown a second head or something.  I don’t get it.  I don’t have an answer for you just commiserating!#This is not true.. It is totally a different thing to be ignorant and not care enough, like saying I have nothing to hide. I can tell u for sure that in greece ppl care for their privacy. There are ignorant ppl in greece and there are ppl who like to expose a portion of their life, but definitely there are limits. In greece we cannot use dash cams to record the traffic and we cannot use videos in our defense if the recording is 'predefined' on the area. I've encountered this in many european countries as well. And not so much in us/canada and asian areas. I agree that younger generation, even in greece, dont really care about privacy though.#This is true, but here in Europe, at least in the countries where I follow media and public discourse, there are more or less vivid discourses about legal actions and frameworks aiming at data privacy.#It’s the same here in America and basically everywhere else. We all have that same conversation about internet privacy. What makes you think people from America don’t care about it? There’s legislation being pushed all over the country to fight against data collection and fight for internet privacy.#The European concern for privacy  exists because the Nazis used government records to identify Jews and other minorities for extermination. Americans haven’t had that experience yet.#As I follow varying US media outlets I seldomly read anything regading this subject. But multiple times I read articles stating how 'progressive Europeans are' or how specifically 'German lawmakers are experts' on this.Edit: Also in the US afaik you basically can't live an everyday life without a credit card. As a result your transactions are traceable.#Yeah I think we’re a bit behind in that regard because all the big companies that harvest internet data are U.S. companies (google, Facebook, Amazon) and they try to influence laws protecting us from that from being passed. It’s definitely an issue that’s discussed though. As far as needing a credit card for daily life that’s not true unless your trying to build up credit for a loan. But you can definitely get by just fine without one.#Regarding the need of a credit card: Don’t you necessarily have to provide credit card details for various contracts eg renting, ISP etc?#No typically you can just use a debit card.#Ok thanks for clarification!"
YangForPresidentHQ;dg9naz;1570766268.0;/r/YangForPresidentHQ/comments/dg9naz/question_about_the_vat/;Question about the VAT;So a major talking point of Yang’s is that Amazon paid $0 in federal income tax last year. He implies that this could be rectified by implementing a VAT in which big data companies would pay their fair share through every Amazon sale, Facebook ad, etc..My question is, wouldn’t the consumer be the one paying the VAT? How does this ensure Amazon pays their fair share?Thanks;"Please remember we are here as a representation of Andrew Yang.

Also many tech companies will have VAT on advertisement, automation, etc. 50% of VAT on point of sale is usually consumed by the company. Look up VAT in Europe. All big tech companies pay VAT there. Look it up how much of it passed along.#So Amazon is going to pay a lot of VAT in their supply chain. Every time they buy some robot arms, a computer system or an advertising service.  So the natural question then is, wouldn't they just pass on 100% of the new cost to consumers?The answer is no, because that's just not how business works.  Passing on 100% of a new cost to existing consumers is a recipe for disaster.   Amazon still has strong competition out there from box stores, etsy, eBay or buying direct from manufacturer.  This is where price sensitivity and competition force companies to swallow many of these costs.  On average the passthrough rate for VAT is around 50%.Another thing to consider is that there are two forces at play where retail prices may actually go down in the long run.  One of them is automation ... which is the whole point of the UBI.  The more Amazon can automate their business, the lower their costs become.  And another force is the UBI itself.  More Americans have money which means more consumer demand.  Higher sales volume also places downward pressure on prices.#Hi, check out Yang’s website: https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/“First, not all goods will be subject to the VAT. Staples such as groceries and clothing will be excluded from the VAT.Second, the assumption that the entire VAT would get passed on to consumers is incorrect. Consumers are price sensitive, and the demand for most goods is at least somewhat elastic. While prices will likely increase on many goods, the increase will, for the most part, be smaller than the VAT as producers find more efficient ways to produce goods and adjust prices to maximize profitability.Finally, an individual would have to buy a lot of non-exempt items in order to “cancel out” the value of the UBI. Assuming all goods are subject to a VAT and the entire VAT is passed on to consumers, an individual would have to buy $120,000 worth of items before the extra costs associated with a VAT “use up” their UBI. As stated above, those two assumptions are wrong, and most people aren’t spending nearly that much money.”#It is similar to the VAT, called a GST (goods and services tax), introduced in Australia in July 2000. 10% value-added tax for goods and services with exemptions for things such as meat and potatoes.So if you buy AWS time from Amazon, you may may get charged an extra 10% which goes to the gov't. It is not quite as simple as that though as it gets added on the way through the supply chain and subtracted by the inputs. A biz pays the nett to the gov't. Amazon would collect 10% on its sales, subtract the VAT it paid, and send the balance to the gov't.That is, everyone pays a little along the chain according to ""value"" and deducts their VAT inputs.  Prices don't simply go up 10% in many cases.Again, this is not simply the biz marking up their cost and adding an extra 10% as that business selling you the good or service gets back the VAT they paid on the input side. It obviously gets a bit more intricate for products that are a mix of VAT and zero-rated inputs. But wait, there is more...It is not just about the direct cost of goods and service inputs incorporated into the thing sold as a biz will claim back VAT paid on indirect items too, e.g. their HR system license fees, stationery, etc. You tally the VAT collected subtract the VAT paid, and send (usually) or receive (especially for export biz) the balance from the gov't. For example, if you export a lot, your sales are zero-rated, so you don't receive VAT and you'll likely end up getting a cheque from the gov't refunding your VAT paid. This nett amount is normally offset with your pay-as-you-earn employee taxes so it is not always that a business gets funds back but, yes, the gov't may send you a cheque. So, it's complicated in a beautiful value-added way.**Concrete example**Australia introduced a similar ten per cent VAT in July 2000. The result was reconciled after the fact to be a \~2.5% CPI effect:>*""TNTS \[VAT\] is estimated to have contributed around 2½ percentage points of this increase.""*That said, the immediate impact was little under 3%, slightly higher than the overall annual outcome indicating some settling occurred,>*""The main price effect was recorded in the September quarter 2000, with the CPI rising by 3.7 per cent. TNTS \[VAT\] is estimated to have contributed a little less than 3 percentage points to the overall CPI increase in the quarter, significantly lower than the 3¾ percentage points forecast in the 2000-01 Budget. Quarterly inflation outcomes, while exhibiting some volatility, generally returned to more typical levels from the December quarter 2000. This single 'spike' in the quarterly CPI data confirms that the inflationary impact of the TNTS \[VAT\] reforms on prices was essentially once-off in nature and did not become entrenched in inflation outcomes or inflation expectations.""*Source: [http://archive.treasury.gov.au/documents/580/HTML/docshell.asp?URL=New\_Tax\_System.asp](http://archive.treasury.gov.au/documents/580/HTML/docshell.asp?URL=New_Tax_System.asp)**How will it affect me?**A reasonable expectation may be that you take a \~3% hit as a consumer with the Yang plan. Then the question becomes, ""Is a $12,000 Freedom Dividend each a year enough compensation for the \~3% hit you may take?""   If your spending per year (not income) is less than $400,000 per year (12k / 0.03), or $800,000 as a couple, you're probably going to be better off.A VAT is regressive but combined with UBI, the Yang plan is very progressive. That's the magic of the Yang plan combo. It's a smart move and perhaps a once in a lifetime opportunity for the US of A.#Think of it like for every product that comes into the country from amazon and what not there is gonna be a slight Vat to it Probs being 5C to a dollar and when you have huge shipments it adds up quickly.For the Average American family its not gonna be a huge Expense you might have to pay a extra 5 dollars for a full cart of groceries but with the UBI its gonna subset it.#Thank you, everyone. Very helpful information! I’m totally on board. Yang 2020!#Do you have a good source on pass through rate?#I've seen it linked here on reddit several times, but I can't remember. Hopefully someone reading this can pull that up, but if not, I'll look for it tomorrow."

I'm looking for a program with an emphasis on big data analytics or data analytics/engineering in general (University of Washington M.s. Business Analytics - Milgard, for example). However, I don't want the hassle of a dreadful admisions process. Language isn't a problem for me, however I'm not considering the entire global. Maybe Europe and I would considered South Africa, however Im also not considering Australia and the UK is a toss up depending on the admissions process. I've been doing a lot of research but just thought I'd ask. Thanks.;As an American, I found it easy to get into the top schools in London. Of course depends on your programme. I also went to University of Cape Town which I believe has easy admissions for grad school, but not sure if you’d have the best work opportunities there.#What does an easy admissions process mean? No GRE? No CV needed?#The university I work for (Universidad Europea de Madrid) in Madrid, Spain, has an easy and fast admissions process, and the University is very international with a huge % of its students coming from all over the world. It has a partnership with IBM and it offers very interesting programs: AI Expert, Bitcoin-Blockchain Expert, Big Data Analytics, Information and Communication Technology Security, Business Analytics, BIM Management... If you're interested, send me a PM and I will get someone to contact you and offer all the info. It's a private university.#If you are from an English Speaking, you can or rather must think about Republic of Ireland. It is a misconception that Ireland is a part of UK.( Just telling, in case you already didn't know that, don't judge).New Zealand's pretty good but their is saturation in the New Zealand's IT industry. Finding a job might turn out to be exceptionally hard in New Zealand.#Australian universities are relatively easy to get into.#I had the same experience getting into the top universities in Scotland. Plus, the programs are only 1 year.The admissions teams were all so helpful, and responses were very fast. I’m excited to do my MBA next year.#What are the job prospects after graduation?#I’m also interested in pursuing an MBA in Management in Madrid. Studied there this past semester and could honestly say it’s my favorite city in the world#As far as I know, all of them have very good prospects. This university focuses a lot on practical knowledge with very competent and professional teachers, most of whom have a long professional career in top companies like IBM or Apache. It depends on the degree, but afaik these kinds of degrees have none/very low unemployment rate, at least in Spain.#I can't talk for the other universities, but at least Universidad Europea de Madrid have several good options in the field, like Management of Sports Entities (partnered with Real Madrid) or Business Analytics.I'm glad you like the city so much! I love it too :)

But I also belive that if the Valve Ondex would have been avaiable to everyone from the start and if there would be a nice valve vr title *caught*HL3*caught*They would sell way better.What do you guys think? Now that there are finally some numbers;"46,000 units ($30-46 million revenue depending on which kit people bought) is really good for the first 5 months of a first generation product in a niche market. I would imagine Valve is pretty happy with the reception. They were back ordered for several months so they obviously weren't expecting to sell 10x as many or anything like that. And they still haven't opened it up to all countries, which they would if they were hurting for sales.Valve also makes money selling VR games to Oculus headset owners on Steam. So Valve's focus is not solely on Index sales the way Oculus's focus is essentially solely on on Oculus headsets. Revive is great for the small subset of enthusiasts who use it, but Oculus obviously isn't counting on that for Oculus store sales.#Road to VR used to do a monthly analysis from the Steam Hardware & Software Survey. I've not seen one since this one in June though: [https://www.roadtovr.com/monthly-connected-vr-headsets-steam-1-million-milestone/](https://www.roadtovr.com/monthly-connected-vr-headsets-steam-1-million-milestone/)At the moment Valve Index is at 4.98% of total headsets connected to steam according to the monthly Steam survey: [https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam)I don't think the survey is very reliable though.

It's the best system and revive runs near perfect usually. I've always assumed that until valve was shipping essentially world wide we wont get an announcement.  Once everyone has the ability to purchase the index you will see the game announcement. It would actually be a bad marketing move to announce the game before world wide shipping. This would incline people to purchase a rift s to play hlvr.#I think its selling okay but Valve is reluctant to boast about the sales since they are busy with returned units.

Reformed;dg97d4;1570763763.0;/r/Reformed/comments/dg97d4/request_for_advice_concerned_about_entering_the/;Request For Advice: Concerned About Entering The Big Data Field;Hello Everyone,I have an opportunity at my current employer to learn Big Data-related technologies. The technologies that would I learn would help me move into a Data Engineering role[1]. However, I am concerning that the data gathering/mining that I would be doing for an employer would potentially involve the personal information of U.S. or other citizens that could potentially be exploited.Any thoughts on if this is an employment area that Christians should be wary of? Any Data Engineers/Scientists out there who are willing to Chime in and let me know if they have any privacy concerns related to their work?[1] https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-engineering-a-quick-and-simple-definition;"Not all data science or big data jobs deal with human data. Some use sensor data from a car or factory. Predictive diagnosis of failures in a system. Optimize a production pipeline. Some fold proteins or analyze chemical properties to try to predict others' properties. Et cetera. In the media these common applications often go unmentioned because there is little controversial about them (high frequency trading being a notable exception).I used to be a data scientist and would prefer to still be. Mind you, I worked with unique (consented) data sets.One company specialized in determining purchase intent to generate sales leads for our customers. They did they by harvesting tweets and figuring out traits of the person (number of pets, income, married/unmarried, job, city, etc....). It was scary both how accurate we could be and how many of these traits won't explicitly mentioned by the people. But, at the end of the day, the data was public that people willingly submitted to the world.Another few companies I worked with made security software for MLS portals and lead generation for MLS portals. The dataset was people using an MLS. A somewhat voluntary set of people. The ones the security software was being used on literally were aware of it, signed a contract, and were actively informed that software was in place that monitored them.Some of the data sets are obtained less than consensually. One type that comes up infrequently but ignites the news is things like Cambridge Analytica. A person for a few dollars or an entry into a competition hands over all their friends' data by clicking some button with vague sounding permissions. I'd be fine working on this type of dataset depending on what it was used for.#I've followed the privacy issues around technology for a couple years now, and I tend to err on the side of privacy.  I think it probably comes down to how much you trust that your employer wants to keep its customers' data secure.  Historically, most companies that have had the capability to gather customer data have not kept it secure very well, or used it for customers' interest.  I guess it's up to you how much you trust your employer to do the right thing.#Was never a data engineer, but on the sales side of data modeling.  Pretty scary what they can find.  Had a Christian non-profit looking to build up their donor database.  Told me that their ideal donor was a mainline Christian who lived within 50 miles of a major metropolitan area and had at least a master's degree.  Specifically on the east coast and west coast.  Sent off the request to my data engineer and a week later he came back with a list.  Cost them almost $5 a name and address, but they ended up buying a few thousand addresses from me.#[deleted]#Why are you no longer a Data Scientist? Did you choose another role?#And that's just for advertising. Imagine what an unscrupulous government or government employee could do.#Are you doing data engineering for another company now? Or are you in a different role?#$. A job opened up that paid 2x.I want to pivot back into data science.#Eh. Government tech is actually pretty bad. We assume that they are monitoring us, but the DOD is still running some programs from 5.5"" floppies. Gov tech is woefully behind.BUT, the government does use their power to pry data from the major tech companies. This is why the recent Carpenter decision at SCOTUS was important. Gorsuch has indicated a way forward on privacy issues based on the 4th Amendment that requires changing the current precedents.Edited: I confused 5.5"" floppies with 3.25 and originally wrote 5.25"".

So can someone tell me which one is better in the upcoming years and perks of these each.If u are currently doing these master i would really love it if u can reply and Does data science have a lot of high math.....Any suggestion would be amazing.";"You'll make the most money in whatever you do best, which highly correlates to what you enjoy.  And no one here can answer that.  To some people, data science is a fascinating look into numbers and trends.  To others, it's glorified excel so that you can print pictures for  execs so they can feel good about themselves.  We don't know which camp you fall into.#Don't chase the money. After a while it'll drone on you and you'll be miserable - as cliche as it sounds the statement is true: ""Work never feels like work if you do what you love.""Do you like data science because you find it interesting or do you like data science because you find the money interesting?#i am down to learn....I like databases , programming etc.The thing is i kinda weak at high level [math.](https://math.So) So does data science contain a lot of high level math.if u compare these two together in the upcoming years which one is more beneficial such as salaries and opportunities.....Plz i would really be thankfull if u can reply with a detailed answer one more question...If i take normal computer science master can i get a job in big data engineer ?#Going to disagree with you. Work absolutely feels like work even if it's what you love. I loved programming but sitting in front of a computer for a job every day to program made me hate it. I stopped doing hobby projects. I didn't want to keep up with the latest trends. If you do something for work, well anything you do day after day after day can lead down a path of disliking it. Which is why I refuse to let my hobbies become a job. I no longer do programming for a job and it was the best. I started enjoying programming again. I don't dislike my job, but it's not something I love and that is okay. The money I make funds my hobbies so after work I now enjoy myself so much more.#Being brutally honest i like computer science as a whole like Databases , programming all kinds of stuff and thats one of the reason why am unable to [decide.](https://decide.So) But keeping the morals aside i need a serious answer from you.If we compare these data science and computer science masters which one will be more benefical and in terms of salary........BTW if u have knowledge of these fields can u tell me what i should study in these fields.....AND again does data science have high level math or can i manage it with normal math....if i take computer science what can i do later on ?.....Sorry if i am sounding like an idiot but my circumstances as well my thrive of being successfull is pushing me way past my limits.#Maybe it wasn't the programming that you did as work which made you hate it but corporate process and environment around it.#Realistically speaking, experience trumps education. If you are going to a top school, the master's will get you the interview but not the job. Data science might involve higher levels of math than general computer science - you will at least be involved in a space like decision analytics or the like where statistics and computationally heavier subject matters might show up. It all depends on the company. If you want to do the master's, that's an issue altogether separate. Do you want to stay a generalist and pursue MSCS or specialize and get into data science?A generalist might be able to do DS but it might not be true the other way around. A DS might be able to get a higher paid job right now because DS is hot and popular but think will it be the same 10, 20, 30 years from now?Being a generalist means you can hop from place to place - you have breadth - you may be making slightly less money - but that you need to understand is buying you opportunity.I cannot tell you what to decide  but know that the jack of all trades and a master of none usually does better than the master of one.#Sure it probably was a bit of that. But the reality is that when you need money, you got to work. And that means likely finding a job in corporate world. I do like programming on my own terms, but not sure what job would fit well with that unless I started my own company.#You sir , Opened my eyes to a whole new perspective.First of all , i am really thankful for taking your time and replying.I might consider masters in computer science as you said ""Jack of all trades and a master of none usually does better than master of one - Beautiful way of expressing  ) "" but the thing is considering the way technology is moving every company would require DATA SCIENTIST to store,process and extract data no matter which product of data whether its software or hardware. So thats one of the reasons why i am still having this ambivalent feelings for each.But i totally understand what your saying and i will surely take you in consideration.The thing is no matter what field it is , unless i enjoy and be the best at it.There wouldn't be no progress.So from a student perspective i have a lot of constraints in deciding.if i take computer science :There's programming , computing and overall less math and its generalized so i can shift any time even if trend of some certain thing goes down.\*I have a doubt ""Does this Master of computer science involve big data or any databases"".&#x200B if i take data science :There's programming , database analysis and more of math.Its the hot spot now so more opportunities and high salaries.But it may go down in few years we may never now.#[deleted]#> Does this Master of computer science involve big data or any databasesAbsolutely!There's nothing stopping you from pursing big data/database jobs with a MSCS.You'll be prepared for it enough.With DS, you are looking at your statistics/decision/analytics type jobs which utilize programming as a tool to solve their data science problems.If they could do it with pen and paper, you'd bet that they'd do that instead.I think you can get best of both worlds.Find a MSCS degree program with a specialization in Data Science.That way you have the generalist degree if you want to broaden your prospects when you want to, but also dive deep into DS if you need to for now.#I definitely prefer autonomy. Which is why my current job is pretty nice. I set my own schedule, I choose what I work on, and I work with the direction of the company. I present to the CEO this past week for example. But it's sales/marketing for a tech company. So I still get to keep up with tech stuff but am just  using my previous software experience to help sell software and help direct the product direction for more sales. Which is great salary wise. Being close to sales means more money. And as I mentioned, I can now do programming as a hobby again. Which I enjoy! Maybe programming as a career wasn't meant for me personally.#Hahah i found my answer....If i do Masters in computer science with some specialization such as CYBER SECURITY OR DATA SCIENCE ,I would be covering both the worlds and have no fear about choosing between any of them. Btw i have a question ""Do i need to check each university graduate program to see if they provide Masters in Computer Science with some specialization such as data science or cyber security "" or do i get to choose these specializations in-campus separately after getting into a Program of Masters in computer science no matter the universities i get into ?#Well, that's good to hear. How is sales? How do you make sales? What happens if you don't make sales (as in the product itself is so bad people don't buy it)?I've always wondered about it.#Sales is a lot of fun. You get to work with tons of different kinds of customers. When it comes to compensation, the more that is sold means more money for you. It can be stressful though if you aren't good at it or you have a bad product. Thankfully our product is amazing. It's a lot of politics and knowing the right things to say. We also do value based selling. Meaning we get numbers to prove our product will save our customers money. Which makes selling easier. I'm now in product adoption. I work with customers to drive sales by showing off the new features and get feedback. I also just pitched an idea to make the company even more money so I'm leading a new initiative across the company. Lots of recognition in sales orgs and the biggest limit to your success is yourself."

This is not some startup, this is a fairly large company with over 4billion annual revenue.   This is not meant for a humble brag or anything like that, but I am worried that if I take this position it could hurt me possibly in 1-2 years if I want to hop to a new company.  I'm afraid that won't take me seriously and think I am esentially lying on my resume if it lists Lead Big Data Architect as my previous role and I only have 3 years experience.  I eventually want to be a big data/cloud architect.   Is this a valid concern?  The salary is pretty incredible, 165K base, in low COL area.   Would I be crazy to pass this up?  This is not meant as a humble brag, just seems to good to be true, and could possibly hurt my career after this job.;"You are stupid. Obviously take it.#""This job is so good and pays so well that I'm worried people won't believe how truly big my dong is when I tell them I worked there.""You definitely don't want those problems. Don't take it. In fact, I'd probably get out of software altogether and become an alpaca farmer somewhere in the Midwest.#You are not bragging because you don’t have a fucking offer yet.  lol#This appears to be a senior-ish role. For positions as a senior, the company is looking for stability. The question of “were should we be in five years, and how will we get there” is asked of architects. If you leave in a year or two, and I was looking for another architect and your resume was one that I’d have to consider... I’d look more to someone who wanted to settle down and solve the problems that took half a decade rather than jumping from role to role. If you want to settle down, it would be a good position. If you are still looking for new things and will move to another before the roadmap is on its way... look to other positions rather than architect roles#lol no, take it if you get it, nothing about that will hurt your career. only thing is that the job might be difficult at that level, so be prepared to deal with stresses#What company is this?!#Right, I realize it will definitely require some extra hours a week! No question.  My worry is if my goal is to possibly go to a FAANG in 2 years, this job experience may hurt me opposed to other experience, as I won't be experienced enough to get an architect role there, and my past 2 years of experience won't necessarily help me get a Senior SDE role.#Not going to give away due to DOXXing reasons, but it's not a startup, but you more than likely have never heard of it.  (Why I gave there annual revenue) (I Never heard of them before this role)#Job title is meaningless, it’s all about the skills. Define the work in such a way that it benefits you#What is 'big data' in this case?#Spark/Hadoop/etc..#I just am asking because I have seen/heard a lot of people talking about 'big data' when in reality it is not, and that might hurt your career. Either way, doesn't seem like that much a problem.#Big data, specifically in the cloud, seems to be a hidden gem in the CS field from my experience.

I might jeopardize my chances at promotion but I would honestly enjoy my job a lot at these places.&#x200B Have you ever been a situation like this?;A promotion is usually not worth anything these days (maybe 2-5% at most companies). It would be better to stay until you find another job, then quit.

A bunch of people also told me that I'd be a great teacher and I like the idea to help teens find their way in life and have a positive influence on them.Now the big problem here is pretty much the money, with a good degree in CompSci I can make a lot more than in teaching and I also don't want to ""throw away"" my degree.So I thought about teaching part-time, to kinda do both.  Is anyone here doing something like this and can talk a bit about how it is?General recommendations would be great. I'm mostly thinking about highschool-level because I would love to use my knowledge.Ohh and I'm currently in the UK, so if anyone knows what kind of training/courses/degrees I would have to get, just let me know.";There’s a lot of volunteer work that involves teaching students especially about computers. You might want to look up if the local Boys and Girls club has programs that interest you or if you could help an organization like Girls Who Code or something similar.Volunteering for one of these organizations or a nearby school would be the closest experience to guiding students and helping them like you do with friends. Being an actual teacher is way more work and a huge commitment for very little compensation.#I'm not sure how you'd go into teaching part time without training. You'd need to go full time to train then apply for part time roles. You'd need to go through a PGCE at uni or some kind of SCITT program.I teach CS and you need to brace yourself for the extraordinary level of computer illiteracy you will be facing.

I love it, what I love must of all is how cs teaches students perseverance, a skill transferable and essential in every core subject. I'd say if you've always liked teaching and you love computer science go for it!

We are looking to change the way large companies gather ""big data"", and are hoping to help bring some of the profits back down to consumers. The idea: With big data quickly becoming one of the more profitable industries on the market today, companies are constantly trying new ways to gather data about the every day user. This interaction is largely anti-consumer, and only profitable to major corporations. The idea behind Airo.Life’s be free phone project is to help get some of that money back into the hands of the consumer. The phone is funded by non-intrusive content ads that are atop of the device during use of the phone, as well as the standard data that is already being collected by using a smartphone in the digital era. With this transaction, users are opting in to their data collection, but actually benefitting from the transaction by means of a free physical cell phone device as well as a call/text/data plan for the device. This could save individuals roughly $50/month or more, as well as up to $200/month for families. All this while having potentially some of the highest viewership for advertisers  a real mutually beneficial transaction.The campaign:As a way to draw attention to the project and to help do our part during the current climate crisis, we are running an advertising campaign which will allow people to help the world by helping us plant trees – another mutually beneficial transaction.

Also thanks for letting us know about Google, because that is incorrect. I work with Airo.life and Holeshot1. I can assure you Holeshot1 is still in business as a media company. Holeshot1 has handled numerous social media campaigns that were very successful for Rockstar energy, Royal Distributing and many car dealerships.  You are correct that Holeshot1's web presence needs an update, the reason being we have decided to focus on Airo.life and it's launch while maintaining our current clientelle for Holeshot1. Holeshot1 also did sell Headphones and other tech, however we have stopped this aspect of Holeshot1 because Holeshot1 was and is mainly a marketing company. For anyone wondering about our CEO and his work history, his LinkedIn would be a good place to look.#The company we are using is offering us $0.10 per tree, and we will be plating the trees over an amortized period. With the amount of investment we've seen over the past few years of the project, even if it were to get out of hand (and we're hoping it does!) we'd be able to meet the goals we've set.#And in regard to Black Mirror.

I don't think personally the product will fit for me, but I like the vision. Giving opportunity to those who need it is a great mission statement, and giving people the ability to benefit from data mining is an interesting motive as well#Well we believe in the quality and caliber of the phone even before it has the ad based system applied to it. We imagine most people will prefer to wait to get it or whatever upgraded model we have available at the time. However seeing that we are raising funds to help make the freemium model a reality we thought offering the base model as a funding option couldn't hurt.  As for the other perks that include the BE FREE phone, you'll notice that there are other items like accessories and preferred member services  being offered with them, which we feel offer the value of the given ask.  Therefore the phones with the Ads are still being offered for Free.  We have to sell something otherwise why bother with indiegogo in the first place? We know this is a cool idea and we respect that other creatives do too and might want to help us out along our journey.#Thanks!#You are a scammer and just full of bullshit.#I'm sorry you feel that way. If you notice our campaign is ""fixed funding"" , which on Indiegogo means if we don't meet our goal, everyone will automatically be refunded. Also as said before we are offering additional items in our perks which cover the ask. We are dreamers that are trying to implement big change, therefore we expect some not to understand our ideas.  Statistics clearly show cellphone use is increasing year by year and people are spending less time watching traditional television and other media and more time watching content on phones. Advertising naturally moves to where the audience is, so for us it makes sense that advertisers will be willing to pay for such a great opportunity to increase thier visibility. From our experience and feedback we have received so far this has proved true.  We hope in a few years our actions will speak for themselves."

Until the various entities start having their traffic controllers talk to each other and synchronize, Broward will never improve its traffic flow.#Yes#Isn't that the entire point if AI and big data coming in to solve the problems?#The first issue to solve is that most traffic RTUs are not physically interconnected between agencies. Until those links are in place, each intersection cannot talk to each other. That means that the machine learning from one light can’t share information with the next. This is why we can’t synchronize lights in Broward currently.. county owns this light, State owns that light, city owns some too but none of them can communicate with the others. To do that is a massive capital investment because all the RTUs would need to be changed for new hardware and then a centralized system would need to process all the data.If one agency owned all the lights, machine learning makes total sense.

statistics;dl21o2;1571671201.0;/r/statistics/comments/dl21o2/qmethods_question_measuring_impact_of_political/;[Q]Methods Question - Measuring impact of political party identification on attitudes toward speech restriction;I am a self-taught stats novice, but am looking to practice data analysis on my own. I’ve acquired a big data set on college campus student expression (mostly perceptions/attitudes toward different types of speech). I want to look at the relationship between student political party identification (IV) and their attitudes toward restriction of speech (DV), and then see if the relationship changes based on student class (e.g. freshman, sophomore, junior, senior year).What statistical test would allow me to best do so? Could I use regression with party ID and student class as IVs and see how predictive they are? Or would an ANOVA be best so that I could compare the two ideologies at different student levels (though the data are not longitudinal)?;"Sounds like a party by class interaction is something to consider, the rest of the model could vary widely. It sounds like It will be difficult to get an estimate of the “impact” however.#How have you measured attitudes towards restriction of free speech? If it's a single Likert-type question (e.g. the answers are strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree), then an ordinal logistic regression would be it.If your question was asked as yes/no, then you'd use logistic regression.(That said, economists have historically used probit versions of both of these  there's not really a substantive difference in the end.)#How is ""attitudes toward restriction of speech"" measured?#They were likert-style questions with 4-5 options per question. I looked up ordinal logistic regression. Can I use this method if all of my variables are ordinal and based on likert-type questions and my DV is not binary?#The survey asked ""Do you thinkcolleges should orshould not be ableto establish policiesthat restrict each ofthe following typesof speech orexpression oncampus?"" and then provided options for yes, no, and no opinion for each type of speech.#The question of what regression to use mainly focuses on the dependent variable. For a continuous DV, many researchers will start with linear regression (aka ordinary least squares  ANOVA is a relative to linear regression). As I noted, categorical outcomes call for some type of logistic regression instead. There are other types of DVs, and you can Google these.The format of the independent variable is a different issue from what regression to use. For any type of categorical IV, you just treat it with dummy variables in any type of regression. Most statistical software can automatically generate the appropriate dummies for you. Just for your info: Continuous IVs are easy, but sometimes the functional form isn't really linear. This is where you would get into things like quadratic or other polynomial terms, splines, etc. For example, say you are using student class as your IV. For an ordered logit regression, you'd wind up saying something like ""Being a sophomore is associated with 1.5 times higher odds of endorsing higher levels of speech restriction compared to freshmen. Being a junior is associated with 1.9 times higher odds, and being a senior is associated with 2.1 times higher odds.""In other contexts, one might have years of education as the IV, and treat that as continuous.#How many variables do you end up with there?#This is very helpful - thank you. Can I use logistic regression for a variable that asked a question and gave yes/no as answers ALONG with a ""no opinion"" option?#It depends.If there are just a few people who gave no opinion, then I bet a lot of analysts would drop those answers from the analysis and just focus on the yes vs no answers. This is not a complete analysis, though.A better choice would be to use multinomial logistic regression. This is when you have un-ordered categories. Race is an un-ordered categorical variable. The question of free speech and restriction of campus speech does sound like it stems from the US context, so you may already know that race in the US is often coded as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian and Pacific Islander, etc, then Hispanic of any race. That's clearly un-ordered categorical, even if it isn't used as a dependent variable. You could set no as the base category. You'd see the relative risks of each IV for selecting yes vs. no and for no opinion vs. no.If you have a lot of no opinion responses, definitely choose multinomial logit. If you have just a few, then as you're a novice, you can start by just dropping those without an opinion from that analysis.#This is perfect and answers all of my questions. Thank you so much."

Elliot misses his dad. Angela misses her mom.The only way that happens is time travel, because.. dead in the 80’s. But Sam has already said that time travel isn’t an option one can introduce at this stage.A simulation of the universe is what? Aside from a few billion years of history, the bulk of what we deal with from the day to day is what we acknowledge. We’re all in a SIM, and the illusion is known to be complete because we all agree on lots of things we accept as reality: E-Corp is an entity, money has value, WR’s hubby died in the 80’s, etc.If the particle accelerator we saw is capable of sufficiently advancing quantum computing to the point that WR can leverage the masses of data we’ve surrendered effectively enough, I believe she could reprogram all the sims in the system (that’s us) to believe that it is the day before WR’s hubby died.Since our collective belief about the state of the universe at any point in time during the simulation would be continuously monitored by the software controlling it, if we all suddenly believed it was 1982, the simulation will be forced to restore any and all entities necessary for the world to proceed forward from that moment in time without us perceiving the absence of those items.Anything missing would be perceived by the sims as an anomaly- so the software will restore those missing pieces... including WR’s husband, and Angela’s mom, and Elliot’s dad.In short, cause a Kernel Panic.;I’ll add that when Angela is in the room with WR, WR asks her if she thinks that if one believes in something enough, it can become true.#did you see White rose in front of the quantum calculations in the last episode?#Yep.

Yes, refining raw unstructured data can often result in a smaller structured dataset but that isn't to say Big Data can't be structured too. A single table being over a petabyte is a good example.Also saying small data is more customer centric is also a fallacy: you may have smaller dimension tables being a few percent of the size of fact tables but you can't use one without the other.More commonly, clients with an existing data warehouse vendor will start pushing this kind of logic to marginalize Big Data vendors and protect their relationship with a client - ignoring many of the potential gains from looking at alternatives.#Big Data is simply data that is too large to fit on a single host/machine/node/device.  Small data is data that can fit on a single device and so can be processed ""locally"".  Big Data requires some sort of scale-out approach, where it sits on multiple devices, and so the processing must be done on multiple devices. When comparing size of Big vs Small, that is what most are referring to. This does not say anything about schema management.  Some scale-out engines fit a ""schema on write"" paradigm (e.g. Cassandra). Some engines take a ""schema on read"" approach (e.g. Hadoop). Big data does require different tools for analysis.  With small data, we can often use the wundertool: Excel. But for Big Data we need something like MapReduce, or better: Spark.#It's as different as black males and Asian males"
econmonitor;dfivit;1570635902.0;/r/econmonitor/comments/dfivit/datadependent_monetary_policy_in_an_evolving/;Data-Dependent Monetary Policy in an Evolving Economy;[Chair Jerome H. Powell, 61st Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics, Denver, Colorado](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20191008a.htm)* 100 years ago, some of the first Fed policymakers recognized the need for more timely information on the rapidly evolving state of industry and decided to create and publish production indexes for the United States. Today I will pay tribute to the 100 years of dedicated—and often behind the scenes—work of those tracking change in the industrial landscape.* I will then turn to three challenges our dynamic economy is posing for policy at present: First, what would the consequences of a sharp rise in the price of oil be for the U.S. economy? This question, which never seems far from relevance, is again drawing our attention after recent events in the Persian Gulf. While the question is familiar, technological advances in the energy sector are rapidly changing our assessment of the answer.* Second, with terabytes of data increasingly competing with truckloads of goods in economic importance, what are the best ways to measure output and productivity? Put more provocatively, might the recent productivity slowdown be an artifact of antiquated measurement?* Third, how tight is the labor market? Given our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, this question is at the very core of our work. But answering it in real time in a dynamic economy as jobs are gained in one area but lost in others is remarkably challenging. In August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announced that job gains over the year through March were likely a half-million lower than previously reported. I will discuss how we are using big data to improve our grasp of the job market in the face of such revisions.;>  we closely monitor developments in oil markets because disruptions in these markets have played a role in several U.S. recessions and in the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s. Traditionally, we assessed that a sharp rise in the price of oil would have a strong negative effect on consumers and businesses and, hence, on the U.S. economy. Today a higher oil price would still cause dislocations and hardship for many, but with exports and imports nearly balanced, the higher price paid by consumers is roughly offset by higher earnings of workers and firms in the U.S. oil industry. Moreover, because it is now easier to ramp up oil production, a sustained price rise can quickly boost output, providing a shock absorber in the face of supply disruptions. Thus, setting aside the effects of geopolitical uncertainty that may accompany higher oil prices, we now judge that a price spike would likely have nearly offsetting effects on U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).#> Where others saw capacity constraints and incipient inflation, Greenspan saw a productivity boom that would leave room for very low unemployment without inflation pressures. In light of the uncertainty it faced, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judged that the appropriate risk‑management approach called for refraining from interest rate increases unless and until there were clearer signs of rising inflation. Under this policy, unemployment fell near record lows without rising inflation, and later revisions to GDP measurement showed appreciably faster productivity growth#> Productivity is again presenting a puzzle. Official statistics currently show productivity growth slowing significantly in recent years, with the growth in output per hour worked falling from more than 3 percent a year from 1995 to 2003 to less than half that pace since then.9 Analysts are actively debating three alternative explanations for this apparent slowdown: First, the slowdown may be real and may persist indefinitely as productivity growth returns to more‑normal levels after a brief golden age.10 Second, the slowdown may instead be a pause of the sort that often accompanies fundamental technological change, so that productivity gains from recent technology advances will appear over time as society adjusts.11 Third, the slowdown may be overstated, perhaps greatly, because of measurement issues akin to those at work in the 1990s.12 At this point, we cannot know which of these views may gain widespread acceptance, and monetary policy will play no significant role in how this puzzle is resolved. As in the late 1990s, however, we are carefully assessing the implications of possibly mismeasured productivity gains. Moreover, productivity growth seems to have moved up over the past year after a long period at very low levels  we do not know whether that welcome trend will be sustained.

And the fact that they announce it first on Stadia makes me wonder if we could get an EA on Stadia in November.Stadia looks like a cool platform to do EA on. Just update the source image at the Google data-center and everyone is updated (no downloads). Larian GDC talks have a huge chunk of big data analytics of player behavior. What better way to have this control then in a streaming environment. Player reports a bug and the can just ""snapshot"" the session to see what is going on.&#x200B So is an November EA just around the corner?";"Nope. Do not get your hopes up. This game will be in development for a long time. If we are lucky we get it late in 2020, I predict though late summer of 2021.#Considering BG3 has only RECENTLY been given a teaser, and that’s it... I could see BG3 being a release title for the new consoles (Holiday 2020). So for platforms like PC/Stadia we might see an early access/beta type deal around summer 2020.  But that would almost certainly be a true beta for bug testing. And even then, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s later than that. Be cautiously optimistic, but also don’t expect anything.#Approximately 0%. Larian has seemingly only ever done early access to fund their games, not because they like releasing them unfinished. With the success of D:OS2, they now have enough money to comfortably develop games, hence why Baldur's Gate isn't going to have a Kickstarter, unlike the past 3 Larian games.#The early access had the effect that they could get feedback on act 1 to see what sticks or what needed improvements.  I do hope the go the ""act 1 EA"" route again.#Feedback wasn't their focus, though, except for the early console release, which literally had an NPC for feedback, but that was the exception, not the norm."

Apple spoilt us by shoving down our throat, whatever they put in their MacBook Pros  giving us no upgrade options. It was time for me to jump ship (iPhone to Pixel last year and now this).Back to topic, I will be using this latpop mostly for work and some Netflix binging. I work on Hadoop, Spark (Big Data) and see myself doing  Machine Learning in the future. What do you all think on my upgrade selections for RAM and SSD?&#x200B Here are my specs:* Intel i7 9750H* 8GB RAM (will upgrade it to 32GB)* 256GB SSD (will upgrade to 1TB SSD)* GTX 1650 graphics card* OLED 4K HDR display&#x200B RAM modules I considered:* <Chose this one> Kingston Technology HyperX Impact 32GB (2 x 16GB) 2666MHz DDR4 CL15 (HX426S15IB2K2/32) - this is a good balance price/performance wise.* Crucial 32GB Kit (16GBx2) DDR4 2666 CT2K16G4SFD8266 recommended by other users.* G.Skill Ripjaws 2x16gb 2666mhz* Samsung M471A2K43CB1-CTD 16gb x 2 this is CL17.&#x200B SSDs I considered* <Chose this one> Samsung 970 EVO 1TB, I think this would suffice. Good choice? Worth splurging for the EVO Plus?* Samsung 970 EVO Plus (this is supposed to be as fast as the PRO) 1TB* Samsung 970 EVO Pro 1TB&#x200B Cheers!;We have almost the same laptop except the CPU. For the memory card, I went with [OWC 2666MHz DDR4 PC4-21300](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PTRZSHB/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jiejenn-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07PTRZSHB&linkId=3c3e776851afc8efc35df85c915b3bc8) (32GB x 2), and the performance has been pretty excellent after 3 weeks of use so far. A bit pricey, but since I will be using this laptop almost 6 to 8 hours a day with few 4K video editing and rending, I want to invest a little bit.For the SSD card, I went with [Samsung 970 Evo Plus 1TB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MFZY2F2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jiejenn-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07MFZY2F2&linkId=debc5fb99924d9b3e5924b77a0bff193). I really wished I went with 2TB just because the data transfer speed is extremely fast and I can see the performance boost when I am doing big data stuff. If you are not doing anything crazy, then just go with the regular Evo 970, Plus or Pro more be an overkill. So far, really enjoy the performance of this laptop.#Didn't you already create a thread about this?#Those OWC babies don't come cheap. Man you make me drool for the Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2TB now  -)X1E2 comes with 2 slots for SSD, you may wanna fill it up with one more. Or wait until the next fast SSD comes by next year.#And what exactly big data stuff do you do?#I'm deactivating that, made it too shabby. Consolidated all my findings and research into this simple post.#I purchased the 512gb SSD version, added the Samsung SSD 1TB to my secondary ssd drive. I quit my job and is currently traveling the world + making tutorial videos, so I seriously underestimated my need for storage. But if you are stationary, I would probably go with more ram instead of storage since there is always external SSD for additional storage.#MongoDB and machine learning for clients. Otherwise, just simple data analytics stuff using pandas, matplotlib, and dealing with APIs here and there.#Oh. I'll probably stick with the 1TB. I have MS Office annual subscription which gives me 1 TB cloud storage  I move my cold data over there, something you may want to explore.I'm unable to decide which SSD to pick, the EVO or the EVO Plus. Why are there so many options, I miss my MacBook now  -)

Any ideas on how to fix? The data types are matching so I can't figure out why this would possible be tripping up. TIA;Use COUNTIFS, no array required.=COUNTIFS(Model\_Year,$C$2,Warranty\_Code, A5)#So I'm not supposed to use COUNTIFS to avoid compatibility issues. Do you have a solution w/ an array formula?#Ok, that's fair    =SUMPRODUCT(--(Model\_Year=$C$2)\*(Warranty\_Code=A5))**EDIT** CSE not required as it is because SUMPRODUCT has some magic.#Still not working unfortunately. I think it must be related to some issue with matching the Model Year to the original data table. They are both General data types so it should be just a simple text comparison, any ideas on what could cause the issue?#Maybe the years are formatted differently (text vs number). Or maybe there are leading/trailing spaces in the warranty code? Try something like this:    =SUMPRODUCT((--Model_Year=--$C$2)*(TRIM(Warranty_Code)=TRIM(A5)))If that still doesn't work, look in the table where C2 should match a year. Do a simple `=C2=Model_Year` (the one cell, not the range) and see if it comes up as TRUE, and do the same with `=A5=Warranty_Code` on the one cell.#If you type = and click on a cell in the table in the same row, what does the reference look like? [@fieldname]?If so, then it is just the way you are referring to the range.

cscareerquestions;dfnk8w;1570655817.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dfnk8w/best_places_for_a_phd_in_cs/;Best Places for a PhD in CS;A friend of mine is graduating soon with a PhD in Computer Science and MS and BS in Applied Math, all with top grades, from a top 50 Math & CS tech school. She's done some years of solid ML and Big Data research in more academically focused topics (and maybe a couple of internships, I can't remember) where she led research teams.I work at a Big N tech company with a lot of Research/Applied Scientist and PhD requiring roles and we've been talking a little bit about my experiences (I do not have a PhD). She is thinking about going in to the industry rather than academia, and I can only offer so much perspective on the matter. So, I have a few questions:1. What is your perspective on industry vs academia for new PhDs (preferably if you have a PhD and have gone through this)?2. What companies and areas would you say are best (specific companies, but general category can help too) based on her background? This is taking in to account CoL and interestingness and opportunities in areas to live (currently she's on the East Coast but open to moving to most places) and in terms of companies, workload and culture for researchers, compensation for someone of her situation, career path or advancement opportunities, what kind of work is done (how interesting/cutting edge she could work on after getting hired), and any other metrics that are relevant?Thank you, sorry for the ambiguity of some parts, it's just a big decision.;"If you're about to finish your PhD, you likely have a somewhat well-formed idea of where you want to end up. As part of a PhD, you've presented non-trivial original research at conferences, which are attended by university faculty (i.e., hiring committees) and industry researchers (i.e., also hiring committees). Has she not spoken with these folks at conferences?I've been a researcher in both industry and academia. The trade-off I see between the two is that industry is generally more financially lucrative and less stressful, but academic research can be more impactful (i.e., you're more free to reach out to external people like journalists and regulators) and you're better integrated into your research community there. Note that there is a fair bit of overlap between the two  researchers in both realms all got their start in doctoral programs at universities, and people tend to keep connections with their old advisors and groups.#PhD here. Working in industry.> What is your perspective on industry vs academia for new PhDs (preferably if you have a PhD and have gone through this)It doesn't matter. I have very strong opinions about which was better for me, but those opinions do not translate to anybody else. I know people who are much happier in academia and I know people who are much happier in industry. After 5+ years in grad school, somebody should know whether they'd be happy in academia and have a sense for their prospects in getting a tenure track position. > What companies and areas would you say are best (specific companies, but general category can help too) based on her background? The answer here is similar. This is not something that somebody can answer without knowing this person. ML research opens up doors for the major tech companies as well as startups and probably also some of the few remaining industrial labs. All of these options have pros and cons that mean different things to different people.I am a little worried about your mention of ""top grades"" here, since grades in grad school are about as close to meaningless as something can possibly be. Research output is what matters. Is she published in top venues? Does she have a lot of citations? That's what matters.#Your PhD advisor should be coaching and guiding you.  Your thesis project should also be giving you direction as to what to do and where to do it.  You should have chosen your thesis project based on what you ultimately wanted to do.PhD is not an automatic ticket to a high paying job.#PhD adviser should be guiding you and the project should also be giving you direction as to what to do and  to finish your PhD, you likely have a somewhat well formed idea of where you want to end up As part of a PhD.#Top 50 -> N.B.C (Nobody Care).#I would assume she has as she has spoken at some conferences and such. We haven't covered all her options too in depth as we've mostly been talking about things at my company. I mostly just wanted to get a better idea of how things look for PhDs in general so that I can help her better. That makes sense. Thanks for your reply!#Thanks for your response! I just know she had good grades, I didn't know if that meant anything (I know it didn't for undergrad hiring). I meant ""solid research"" to also show that she had done a lot of research, published papers with it, spoken at conferences about the research, etc. Not having gone through any of the stuff for PhDs I have very little context for it and am just trying to understand what the deal is with recruiting as a PhD. I imagine that she has a lot of opinions on the matter and knows better what she wants than what we may have talked about, I am just curious about the topic and want to know more for myself and so that I can help from my side. Sorry for the lack of info/knowledge to ask a well worded question.#I imagine my friend's getting help from her advisor and others around her and knows more about exactly what she's wants to go in to, etc. I'm just trying to get some broader context on the subject since we've talked a little about it, and I've only seen it from the undergrad perspective.

I've researched a mountain of information on both universities. However, It's a little bit hard for me to find suitable materials for this joint degree since my English may not good enough. :(The main reason I choose to study in Amsterdam because of its history, big city, and motivated students coming from all over the world.I am so lucky since I was admitted to the Master of Computer Science joint-degree ( Majoring in Big Data Engineering) with UvA/VU, and I have some question need to be answered. I hope that this website has students who study in this program and kindly give me some practical information.1. Is it true that, for this program, most of the time I will study at VU Amsterdam?2. I have heard that joint-degree will be registered with both universities, so is it true that I will have two student cards that can help me to use both universities' facilities?3. what is the typical expense for international students when studying in Amsterdam? except for tuition fees.4. As I want to focus on the research and pursue a Ph.D. in the future, is there any opportunity for a master's student doing some research work with the professor while studying？5. Can this degree be verified double degree in China or just a single degree be awarded by VU Amsterdam? If there are Chinese students who can answer this question.6. Anything else I should know? :)Thanks!I hope you guys having a nice day!;Others are better suited to answer the other questions, but about typical expenses:* Rent could be as low as ~€400 for a studio apartment (after subsidies) or as high as ~€650 for a shitty room in a shitty house you share with 7 other people depending on how lucky you get.* Utilities + internet totals to ~€90.* Health insurance is ~€80 on the cheap end with low coverage.* One person can do their groceries for about €110 if you’re reasonably frugal. Lidl is cheap, Jumbo, Albert Heijn and Plus are middle of the road.* You may want a bike to get around. Don’t rent it. Get one second-hand for €100 or less from marktplaats.nl#1. Correct2. Yes3. Rent, it is almost impossible to find a room in amsterdam.4. Yes5. It is a single degree where different parts are teached by each university. It is not two programs.6. Housing is almost impossible.

But working in a company: there's something about taking something I love, a hobby, a passion, and seeing it corrupted by company people that just want to use it for money and only care about low-ball budgets and deadlines. Working in software development has ended up being completely different to what it was like studying it. The people are different. Instead of being around bright-eyed gee-whiz nerds, I'm surrounded by (snake oil) salesmen and managerial types that love to twist the words said by technical folk. I also consider my work unethical and I'm disgusted with myself for what I do. Everything is REST APIs these days. And I'm working on web application systems that use REST APIs to on-sell your browsing interactions, so that everywhere you go you can be stalked by big data and machine learning-generated ads of what you just viewed.I hate my life now, and I can't understand how it turned out this way.What can I do? I can't just go back to university and choose another career. I have adult responsibilities with adult-sized bills now. I seem to be locked in to a life that isn't mine and I don't want. That's what I got from attending college.;You have a Master's in Computer Science, even if you specialized in software development or whatnot you could still absolutely get a different job in a different job area.

Nevertheless, I have never, not once, gotten a single full-length survey from the website. I've been told by other users to answer as many small-survey questions as possible, give lots of opinions and respond to others, just answer anything that comes my way. I've done just that, have a full profile up but still nothing.It's especially frustrating as I'm interested in politics and I'm in a target state for YouGov's surveys yet they still never hit me. A friend of mine, same state, has been hit up multiple times in a row by the same company.I'm beginning to think it's just a big data collecting scam.

I am going to pursue a masters in biological data analysis but am still on the fence about a getting a phd.  If I did, I think I would do bioinformatics.  I am finding that I really like metabolomics, genomics and systems biology.  I have a couple of questions. I already have plenty of debt and would like to continue working as much as possible to pay it off as soon as possible.  Is it possible to work while pursuing a phd, and if so how strenuous is it? Are there jobs out there that pay for higher education like a phd? Also, given my experience and interests that I have already stated, do you think there are better opportunities available to me? I'm currently learning R for statistical analysis but any other advice on what sort of skills I should acquire to help me out in my career would be great.;Of course PhD has the potential to increase your earnings potential greatly. A PhD with a bioinformatics focus will absolutely make you more competitive in both academia and industry. Most PhD programs explicitly forbid you from working while in school - for good reason because you really shouldn’t have time for a second job. PhD takes your entire focus and energy. I know some people have tutored or did housesitting on the side for some extra cash, but that’s probably about it. You can always try applying to jobs with your current background and experience. With mass spec experience you might get into a nice position in industry. You shouldn’t pursue a PhD solely for career progression - a high amount of passion and dedication are also required to get through it.#Thank you. I realize it requires a lot of passion and motivation. I'm hoping that my next couple of years working in academia and pursuing a masters will solidify my feelings on whether o want to pursue a phd.  I love learning and research. I just want make sure I can afford it because I really want to continue paying down my debt while still in school... no accruing interest.#PhD, unlike Masters, is paid. If you're in America the first 2 years of PhD are essentially equivalent to a Masters.# Hi hoping, I'm Dad!
data;dmdk8t;1571906680.0;/r/data/comments/dmdk8t/want_to_enter_the_world_of_data_need_advice/;Want to enter the world of Data. Need advice.;By principle, I am a power engineer. Just the bachelor's. Last month, I attended a workshop on big data and data analytics. While being really informative, it did not quite tell a lot about the necessary prerequisites to start with, or as to what avenues one could/should go for per their interests. Neither did I expect it to, one can only cram so much info into a small workshop. Nevertheless, their workshop has been annoyingly bugging me in the back of my mind ever since.And hence, I come here, looking for a few tips or guidelines as to how to jump ships into the world of data. Stuff I might want to go through. Cheers;I’d start with learning SQL. Download the adventure works database and the free version of Microsoft sql server on your computer. I took this super cheap course on Udemy to study some advanced SQL writing. https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-sql-from-a-to-z/learn/lecture/6454508?start=0#contentAfter SQL, use Python.  I’d recommend reading Python Crash Course by Eric Mattheshttps://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036The learning curve for Python is much harder then SQL  however this is what sets you apart from the men and the boys (or the girls and the ladies) in moving and dealing with ugly data (Pandas, matplotlib, ODBC, etc.). After you get this down, start doing some research about how to use Python and SQL together (connecting to a database, writing queries and executing with Python, creating them into data frames, visualizing then for insightful information).Just to clarify, and I’m sure this may have been covered in your seminar. There are two distinct differences between working in data and then handling big data. You can get really far just using SQL but it all kinda matters how deep you want to train yourself. Piece of advice, learn one programming language/skill at a time, it does not help to juggle multiple languages to achieve writing hello world 50 times.#I'm not entirely sure what a power eng is or what your education is. I'd recommend getting started on coding. Python would probably be the easiest entry point, and enough to take you far.Do a short online course on Python/MLGet familiar with basic statistical and probabilistic concepts.Play around with datasets. Kaggle.com is a very nice place with many datasets. The best part is that people leave their code there for you to learn from and explore. You can find some nice tutorials there as well. They host many completions.Then just play around an learn one algorithm / technique after another.#This is really great. Thanks a lot

We've added tons of stop words and partitioned all the data to the point that it works well, but not very quickly.   We've conferred with Oracle's top Oracle Text resources and just aren't getting the response times in the database we're looking for with text searches (if we don't use text, we get sub-second responses, but text queries take 20+ seconds to respond across the breadth of the data).   When we ingest the text into Elastic we get great response and allows us a few more options for creative searches, but we don't want to completely re-write our app for Elastic.Has anyone successfully merged the two with GG and can point to real-world examples?   All I can seem to find is how to set up GG for Elastic, but not any actual examples.Just to be clear: I'm looking for the ability to run a SELECT statement that can pull together the result from an Oracle table and an Elastic Index.Thanks in advance;Sounds like Stockholm Syndrome to me. Just get rid of Oracle as you have already said Elastic search is fast enough.#RDBMS—>OGG—>Kafka—> Elastic                                            |——> NiFi —> Kudu#LOL - unfortunately not that easy.  Decades of data and several apps that use the database that I don't have any control over.  It's always a money issue.

After doing a lot of research and pondering, I set my sights to try and become a Data Scientist. Of all programs I have looked at, I am most interested in SFU's MSc in Big Data. I saw on LinkedIn earlier, that a whoping 1600 people had applied for the 2019 academic year. 1600!!! And only 100 of them were admitted. Is it really that competitive? What are my chances of getting in. I have a good GPA but little relevant work experience and no papers/research. Can anyone who got an admit message me with their stats? I'm really feeling a bit defeated after finding out how many people applied in the last intake :(;Idk about SFU. But at a top german school their data science program takes about that manly applications and only takes in 20 a year.    Their stats were 1.0 to 2.0. 1.0  is basically a perfect GPA but 2.0 is like a B/ B+ student. They lower the grade requirement if you demonstrate substantial or relevant work experience and international experience such as studying abroad,       Opinion: I hear good things about the Big Data program in terms of career outcomes. Personally, I'd choose Germany. I'd have worse career prospects if I try to work in grmany. At SFU, they might be able to hook me up with a good coop,      However, I'd still choose germany for the better life style and significantly cheaper tuition even for international non-german speaking students.

I started reading a bunch of those self-help books a while ago because I didn't really know what my goals in life were. After a while I came to the conclusion that my dream would be a ""small"" farm/range/estate, pretty much a place to live, big enough for an extended family, surrounded by nature with a handful of animals.Here's a bit of background story why that would be my dream and what I'm exactly thinking about:I grew up at an ancient horse stable, there was an old castle ruin and the stables of this castle from hundreds of years ago were kept in tact by the owners. My parents rented the whole thing and used it to offer horse back riding lessons. As a kid I could just explore the area, play in the forest and so on. The building we lived in was big enough for our family of 4 and one or two friends / extended family members who stayed with us every now and then. Fast forward 15 years, the owner dies, the heirs can't decide who gets everything, so they sell it. The new owner kicks us out because he wants to use it as a restaurant and farm land and we found a new stable to rent.Now whenever I think about my childhood, I remember how I never can visit this place again, because the whole area got a makeover and pretty much nothing is how it was. This brings me to my goal, to buy something similar. To have a place for the next generation of the family to grow up at and for the family to come together and stay for generations to come.&#x200B I know that something like this is quite expensive and even though I'll finish my degree next year and I can look forward to a good paying job, I can't see how I would be able to achieve something like this.Right now I am completely free of any debt and with my savings and scholarship I'll be fine until I graduate. I'm a pretty frugal person when it comes to spending money. I don't really eat out, smoke or drink excessively and I'm fine living in a one room flat. In general, my expenses are pretty low and I don't mind keeping it that way.I read through a couple pages of the wiki, looked at the flowchart and started reading the books from the recommended reading list. I think I will just try to follow the flowchart once I start working, but are there any suggestions what I could do while I'm still studying. Anything I should look into or anything I can do in that one year before I start working full time?&#x200B TL:DRI'll finish my post-grad degree in a year and want to buy a nice house with a good amount of land around it. I don't have any debt, read through the wiki and working my way through the recommended readings. What can I do in my last year of Uni to set a good foundation for my goal?Is there anything else I could do, other than just investing my money in funds? General advice about how to get there would be great too, I'm just getting into the whole money management thing.";You will not go far wrong with following the sidebar, the flowchart and the lump sum guide.The difficult part is identifying the goal - but if you have that, the financial elements are pretty mechanical.#Your childhood sounds amazing! IMO, finish school, start working, advance in your career, travel (see the world!) then assess if this is still what you want to do in your life. You may decide in a few years that you want to stay in a city, or that you want to move to a different country and just focus on your career.While it is good to have some long term goals, give yourself a chance to discover what's out there beyond what you experienced as a child.

As per him, he gave us this project in order for us to kick-in using PySpark and start finding ways of our own to wrap the project. I love this approach of him to force us to self-learn but this project counts for bonus points. Any guidance on how to approach the problem will be highly appreciable :This .txt file is the ad journey of a user & it  contains : >id: string, timestamp: string, type: string, visitorId: string, pageUrl: stringEach line of the file represents an ad event and each user has one unique id called VisitorId.I am required to find next NextPageUrl that visitors visited per event on their event journey. >For Instance: given two sequential in time events e001 and e002 from a visitor v001, the output event o1 should contain the id, timestamp, type, visitorId, & pageUrl from e001 but the nextPageUrl will be the pageUrl from e002My thinking :It is been a month and I am reading about Hadoop on and off but I am very well aware of the fact that I am far away from even getting decent in Hadoop world. Anyway, I think I should first count the distinct VisitorId and then using VisitorID as Key, I can reduce the values of the pageUrl . Do not sound tough but somehow my instincts say that it cannot be this easy. So any input will be highly appreciable and I am looking forward to constructive criticism as well so that I can correct the mistakes and learn more. Thanks.;[deleted]#Thanks a lot. I’m on it.

The goal is to collect everything: every activity, every piece of information, every picture, every occurrence, everything. Big data fully realized.Once everything is collected, that data can be analyzed, and patterns of behavior can be established. Then a super computer with AI can monitor everything. Any deviations from the norm can be immediately exposed and analyzed.For example, everyday, you leave your house at 7 am to go to work at a specific location. But today you didn't. The AI will attempt to explain the deviation. It will check your company's records. Was he fired yesterday? Is that why he didn't go to work today? Nope, he wasn't fired. Check the smart toilet. Oh, he threw up this morning. He's sick. Deviation explained. Oh, and look at that, he called his boss this morning at 8 am to tell him he's sick. And company records have been updated as of 8:37 am. No human needs to be informed of this deviation.Or... A cell tower is reporting that there's a new cell phone in this neighborhood that's never been here before. Whose phone is it? Did a resident get a new phone number? Check the registration records of the phone. It's a prepaid burner, purchased with...cash! Alert a human analyst! (A human gets an email alert.) The computer continues to monitor the intruder. Where is the intruder going? It's going to 123 Panopticon Lane. Accessing camera feeds. Capturing real time video of the intruder ringing the doorbell. Oh, the homeowner let them in. Let's be sure this is a safe situation by listening in on their conversation. Are they talking about overthrowing the government? Are they talking in code? Are they talking about politics? Religion? Are they having an affair? The computer will analyze the conversation and determine the topic and whether or not there's any reason for concern.This is the future. Don't suppose that you can stop it.;

Also, I know sound cards kinda fell out of popularity what sorts of sound solution is common if I were to try to also use this for home theatre? I saw some mobos push 5.1 now (I assume I have to send it through an amp.) what about 7.1? I may be getting greedy here, and really probably won't use this, so push that to the way back of your mind... but running an HDMI to another room so I can tap my computer into a big TV someday with a whole surround system sounds really neat (and I'm not sure if there's much reason beyond being neat)My intended use for this PC is gaming. I really want to do elite dangerous with VR, joystick&throttle, voice command, and 1-3 cameras (1 for streaming, the other two or maybe 3 essentially as security/nany cams) so having a lot of USB is important, and I know sometimes usb cameras get upset if they share a USB header with each other so I think my solution is just to have LOADS of usb... thoughts?there's 1 other game that I'm really interested in playing which is (don't laugh too hard) Morrowind. this game was released in 2002, and doesn't have multi core support. which is why I'm asking this question: Will 4 cores game? I know someday I want to get that sexy 8 core 3.9ghz base ryzen (maybe even 12 years down the line), but that pricepoint is a bit high for me right now. I see... [**AMD A12-9800 Bristol Ridge Quad-Core 3.8 GHz Socket AM4 65W** ](https://www.newegg.com/amd-a12-7th-gen-a12-9800/p/N82E16819113449) used for $100. how well could I get away with that for a while? Morrowind would be happy with that for sure, how badly will it bottleneck my vr stuff? I feel like such fast 4 cores is probably fine as long as I have a powerful enough graphics card right? it's my impression that more cores is useful for people who use their pc to work - big data simulations for physics labs, and hard core graphics artists. While faster cores is really where it's at for gaming. am I way off here?as for graphics, for now I'm thinking 980 or 1080 that I probably also pick up used. someday the dream is of course a 2080, and speaking of that I know dual video cards is a thing. do they have to be 2 of the same video card? could I run a 1080 and a 2080 together for any sort of performance boost? 1080ti still feels like pretty big money to me, what's a solid card that would support my elite dangerous dreams comfortably? the point is to have something that works well, not ""just barely"" for now until I can upgrade to something that'll be relevant for many many years. upgrade time: within a year.Given that it's gaming I'm interested in I'm thinking I'll skip huge ram numbers, 4x4gb sticks seems fine at 3700 hz? I really am out of my element here. buffered? unbuffered? ECC? I've got 2 8gb sticks from my old desktop that I THINK will work (old dell inspiron running an i7 i think...) until I can get the \*choice\* memories with RGB for that RGB performance boost we all know is a thing.&#x200B and now we come to the end I think (unless I forgot something). the ultimate question is this: what motherboard? of course I want input and corrections to all my incorrect assumtions, but I'll be buying this piece-by-piece so I'm not in a hurry for all the things I might buy used. I'm in a place to buy a mobo and a power supply so that's where I'll start. I'm pretty sure corsair 850 gold+ is where I'm going (I may also be an idiot) but I have no idea where to start on the mobo. any other thoughts are appreciated! thank you for reading my ramblings!";You can get a first gen ryzen 1600 and get 6core and 12threads#This sub is usually for parts lists that we can go over with suggestions to get more performance out of. You might have more luck at r/buildapcforme just tell that sub what you want to do with a budget you are willing to spend. I would suggest going to pcpartpicker.com to see what the budget looks like. A ryzen build is generally more cost efficient for the performance you want.#Do not buy that CPU under any circumstances. I used an a10-5800k and it was horrible. That APU, while on the am4 socket isnt ryzen based which means its around 60% slower in single core performance. You should pick up a 2600, its a 6 core 12 thread cpu for 120 usd.  Pair it with an rx 580, or if your budget allows an rx 5700 and you got a decently powerful pc for a good price.

devops;dglpn9;1570829869.0;/r/devops/comments/dglpn9/netdata_the_opensource_realtime_performance_and/;Netdata, the open-source real-time performance and health monitoring, released v1.18!;"Hi all, Release v1.18.0 contains 5 new collectors, 19 bug fixes, 28 improvements, and 20 documentation updates.**At a glance** The **database engine** is now the default method of storing metrics in Netdata. You immediately get more efficient and configurable long-term metrics storage without any work on your part. By saving recent metrics in RAM and ""spilling"" historical metrics to disk for long-term storage, the database engine is laying the foundation for many more improvements to distributed metrics.We even have a [tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/longer-metrics-storage/) on switching to the database engine and getting the most from it. Or, just read up on [how performant](https://docs.netdata.cloud/database/engine/#evaluation) the database engine really is.Both our **python.d** and **go.d** plugins now have more **intelligent auto-detection** by periodically dump a list of active modules to disk. When Netdata starts, such as after a reboot, the plugins use this list of known services to re-establish metrics collection much more reliably. No more worrying if the service or application you need to monitor starts up minutes after Netdata.Two of our new collectors will help those with Hadoop big data infrastructures. The **HDFS and Zookeeper collection modules** come with essential alarms requested by our community and Netdata's auto-detection capabilities to keep the required configuration to an absolute minimum. Read up on the process via our [HDFS and Zookeeper tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/monitor-hadoop-cluster/).Speaking of new collectors—we also added the ability to collect metrics from SLAB cache, Gearman, and vCenter Server Appliances.Before v1.18, if you wanted to create alarms for each dimension in a single chart, you need to write separate entities for each dimension—not very efficient or user-friendly. New **dimension templates** fix that hassle. Now, a single entity can automatically generate alarms for any number of dimensions in a chart, even those you weren't aware of! Our [tutorial on dimension templates](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/dimension-templates/) has all the details.v1.18 brings support for installing Netdata on offline or air-gapped systems. To help users comply with strict security policies, our installation scripts can now install Netdata using previously-downloaded tarball and checksums instead of downloading them at runtime. We have guides for installing offline via **kickstart.sh** or **kickstart-static64.sh** in our [installation documentation](https://docs.netdata.cloud/packaging/installer/#offline-installations) . We're excited to bring real-time monitoring to once-inaccessible systems!**Improvements**- **Database Engine**    - Make dbengine the default memory mode    - Increase dbengine default cache size     - Reduce overhead during write IO     - Detect deadlock in dbengine page cache     - Remove hard cap from page cache size to eliminate deadlocks- **New Collectors**    - [SLAB cache mechanism](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/slabinfo.plugin/)    - [Gearman worker statistics](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/python.d.plugin/gearman/)    - [vCenter Server Appliance](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/vcsa/)    - [Zookeeper servers](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/zookeeper/)    - [Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) nodes](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/hdfs/)- **Collector Improvements**    - rabbitmq: Add vhosts message metrics from /api/vhosts     - elasticsearch: collect metrics from _cat/indices    - mysql: collect galera cluster metrics     - Allow configuration of the python.d launch command from netdata.conf     - [x509check](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/x509check): smtp cert check support    - [dnsmasq_dhcp](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/dnsmasq_dhcp) : respect conf-dir,conf-file,dhcp-host options     - plugin: respect previously running jobs after plugin restart    - [httpcheck](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/httpcheck) : add current state duration chart     - [springboot2](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/springboot2): fix context- **Health**    - Enable alarm templates for chart dimensions     - Center the chart on the proper chart and time whenever an alarm link is clicked - **Installation/Packages**    - netdata/installer: Add support for offline installations using kickstart.sh or kickstart-static64.sh     - Allow netdata service installation, when docker runs systemd     - Make spec file more consistent with version dependencies    - Fix broken links on web files, for DEB     - Introduce separate CUPS package for DEB #6724 and RPM. Do not build CUPS plugin subpackage on CentOS 6 and CentOS 7     - Various Improvements in the package release CI/CD flow     - Remove RHEL7 - i386 binary distribution, until bug #6849 is resolved     - Bring on board two scripts that build libuv and judy from source ---[Check the release log at github](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/releases/tag/v1.18.0).If you are new to netdata, [check a few live demos at its home page](https://my-netdata.io/) and the [project home at github](https://github.com/netdata/netdata).Netdata is FOSS (Free Open Source Software), released under GPLv3+.> Enjoy real-time performance and health monitoring!```";

By using the stock cooler(which is good enough), a relatively small SSD, functional but not fantastic power supply, and cheap case, room can be made for an 8-core CPU, 16gb of ram, and a 1 tb hard drive.A powerful CPU is important in content creation, and the 2700X is strong at this price point. The motherboard will work for this build, its pretty boring other than that. You mentioned leaving a lot of windows up, and doing content creation work, both of which need ram, hence the 16gb kit(note the 16gb kit instead a 16 gb stick, it theoretically doubles memory bandwidth). The storage solution could be better by swapping the sata ssd for a nvme ssd. The pairing of fast ssd and a slower but cost effective hard drive is a good cost saving solution for decent amounts of storage, but gets a tad annoying dragging files back and forth.&#x200B The 580 video card is 31% better on the userbench website, and costs about the same as a 1650, and at this price point value matters. The case and power supply are cheap and will work, but as mentioned earlier, 8 core cpu.I don't know much about headphones, so you might want to get better advice. The build has $50 left for any webcam you see fit. This list also includes dual monitors, but you might need a display port to HDMI adapter, which you can find on amazon for pretty cheap.&#x200B Good luck!\[PCPartPicker Part List\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/list/wwy9Wb](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/wwy9Wb))&#x200B Type|Item|Price\*\*CPU\*\* | \[AMD Ryzen 7 2700X 3.7 GHz 8-Core Processor\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/bddxFT/amd-ryzen-7-2700x-37ghz-8-core-processor-yd270xbgafbox](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/bddxFT/amd-ryzen-7-2700x-37ghz-8-core-processor-yd270xbgafbox)) | $194.89 @ OutletPC\*\*Motherboard\*\* | \[MSI B450 Gaming Plus ATX AM4 Motherboard\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/3YhKHx/msi-b450-gaming-plus-atx-am4-motherboard-b450-gaming-plus](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/3YhKHx/msi-b450-gaming-plus-atx-am4-motherboard-b450-gaming-plus)) | $84.89 @ OutletPC\*\*Memory\*\* | \[Patriot Viper 4 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 Memory\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/h8dxFT/patriot-viper-4-16gb-2-x-8gb-ddr4-3200-memory-pv416g320c6k](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/h8dxFT/patriot-viper-4-16gb-2-x-8gb-ddr4-3200-memory-pv416g320c6k)) | $64.98 @ Amazon\*\*Storage\*\* | \[Kingston Q500 240 GB 2.5"" Solid State Drive\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/g8DJ7P/kingston-q500-240-gb-25-solid-state-drive-sq500s37240g](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/g8DJ7P/kingston-q500-240-gb-25-solid-state-drive-sq500s37240g)) | $29.99 @ Amazon\*\*Storage\*\* | \[Hitachi Ultrastar 1 TB 3.5"" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/wNV48d/hitachi-internal-hard-drive-hua721010kla330](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/wNV48d/hitachi-internal-hard-drive-hua721010kla330)) | $29.99 @ Amazon\*\*Video Card\*\* | \[MSI Radeon RX 580 8 GB ARMOR OC Video Card\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/TTfmP6/msi-radeon-rx-580-8gb-armor-oc-video-card-rx-580-armor-8g-oc](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/TTfmP6/msi-radeon-rx-580-8gb-armor-oc-video-card-rx-580-armor-8g-oc)) | $164.99 @ Newegg\*\*Case\*\* | \[DIYPC Alnitak-BK ATX Mid Tower Case\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/86RFf7/diypc-case-alnitakbk](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/86RFf7/diypc-case-alnitakbk)) | $39.96 @ Newegg\*\*Power Supply\*\* | \[Rosewill 500 W 80+ Bronze Certified Semi-modular ATX Power Supply\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/zVnG3C/rosewill-power-supply-glacier500m](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/zVnG3C/rosewill-power-supply-glacier500m)) | $44.99 @ Amazon\*\*Operating System\*\* | \[Microsoft Windows 10 Home OEM 64-bit\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/wtgPxr/microsoft-os-kw900140](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/wtgPxr/microsoft-os-kw900140)) | $99.89 @ OutletPC\*\*Monitor\*\* | \[Acer R221Q bid 21.5"" 1920x1080 60 Hz Monitor\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JWM323/acer-r221q-bid-215-1920x1080-60hz-monitor-umwr1aa001](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JWM323/acer-r221q-bid-215-1920x1080-60hz-monitor-umwr1aa001)) | $79.98 @ Amazon\*\*Monitor\*\* | \[Acer R221Q bid 21.5"" 1920x1080 60 Hz Monitor\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JWM323/acer-r221q-bid-215-1920x1080-60hz-monitor-umwr1aa001](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JWM323/acer-r221q-bid-215-1920x1080-60hz-monitor-umwr1aa001)) | $79.98 @ Amazon\*\*Headphones\*\* | \[Thermaltake SHOCK  Headset\]([https://pcpartpicker.com/product/FxFXsY/thermaltake-headphones-htshk002ecbl](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/FxFXsY/thermaltake-headphones-htshk002ecbl)) | $39.48 @ Amazon| \*Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts\* || Total (before mail-in rebates) | $994.01| Mail-in rebates | -$40.00| \*\*Total\*\* | \*\*$954.01\*\*| Generated by \[PCPartPicker\]([https://pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com)) 2019-10-17 01:13 EDT-0400 |#Thank you so much!"

Planning to start engineering club next year but need some info from you guys. I'm studying in Malaysia btw. What are some engineering club or closer to engineering clubs that you can recommend to me?My uni already got mechatronics club, IoT club, Big data, and data analysis club.;During my undergrad me and some friends started our own engineering club. We advertised ourself as “the future of [school’s]  engineering.” We even held interviews to see who to accept into our club and made everyone pay dues. Ended up spending every ones dues on shirts and a few bar tab socials and then the organization died before the year was over. Was a lot of fun actually.#If you like mechE design you could look into a car building club - my school has baja and formula car clubs and they seem decently universal but I’m not sure about outside the US

But all the frameworks and new languages and platforms you can just learn as you need them.#I'd say don't bother with algorithms unless you are doing research. And forget about frameworks. I'd definitely got to know design patterns really well. The rest will be learned on the job as you go. Also if you feel adventurous try learning functional language like Scala (Haskell if you are single). But than again if you don't maintain your knowledge you just loose it. So, just learn what you need and be happy!!! I usually go by ""Oh, what's that? Let me google it."""

And how could such a guideline apply to a man who's 5'3 and 130 pounds and a 6'4 man who's 260 lbs.I'm a pretty good google user, but I spent a whole day on bing and google and couldn't find any data in the following categories which could be used in a simple model:**Category 1:** blood alcohol level VS liver disease or brain damage**Category 2:** adult males/females who drink X servings of alcohol per day/week/month VS liver disease diagnosis or brain damage diagnosis **Category 3:** data sets on statistical likelihood of non-alcoholic binge drinkers developing liver disease or brain damage where binge drinking is defined as in excess of a particular number of drinks over time or a particular blood alcohol level **Do you think there's an even slightly useful way to model specific drinking habits mirroring those of average heavy drinkers and determine risk?** And could we use statistics to argue a marginal decrease of a specific amount of alcohol would reduce risk (within a set interval of confidence) given a typical healthy person's sex, height, weight, and body-fat %?In general wouldn't it be nice to see public health guidelines about alcohol that use big data and could help people make informed choices about their drinking and risk? Don't you think a lot of people might marginally cut back on drinking, maybe one less night per week, or 3 less drinks per day, given some sophisticated models? I think the a lot of heavy drinkers would cut back moderately if they were told, ""Hey Ms. Jane Doe 1 less night per week, reduces your risk of liver disease by 33%."" or ""Howdy there mister 'Joe Sixpack' if you average 7 less drinks per week, and you reduce your chance of stroke by 25%""?What do you think?";

It's a two year programme and I'm on the 1st year, 1st semester. I'm about to start research work for my thesis and just talked to my thesis supervisor. When we discussed the scope of my thesis (basically a web app to do some financial analysis) she said I should really consider changing programmes and doing specialization in big data, where she also teaches. She said it would be a great project for what they are studying and fits their curriculum really well. The problem is I'm not very good at math, specifically ""continuous"" math, i.e. calculus. I do know and understand discrete math fairly well though. She said they did not study math but I guess at that point it's implied you know all math from your bachelor's programme. So I guess I have two questions:1. Should I consider switching career paths? 2. How much math do you have to use in your daily work as a big data engineer? \*\*  if I do decide to switch to big data I'd like to specialize in financial analysis since I have 2 years of education (dropped out) in this field and I did not have any problems with math over there.";Friend of mine is a big data engineer.

Ubuntu;dgltvb;1570830440.0;/r/Ubuntu/comments/dgltvb/netdata_the_opensource_realtime_performance_and/;Netdata, the open-source real-time performance and health monitoring, released v1.18!;"Hi all, Release v1.18.0 contains 5 new collectors, 19 bug fixes, 28 improvements, and 20 documentation updates.**At a glance** The **database engine** is now the default method of storing metrics in Netdata. You immediately get more efficient and configurable long-term metrics storage without any work on your part. By saving recent metrics in RAM and ""spilling"" historical metrics to disk for long-term storage, the database engine is laying the foundation for many more improvements to distributed metrics.We even have a [tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/longer-metrics-storage/) on switching to the database engine and getting the most from it. Or, just read up on [how performant](https://docs.netdata.cloud/database/engine/#evaluation) the database engine really is.Both our **python.d** and **go.d** plugins now have more **intelligent auto-detection** by periodically dump a list of active modules to disk. When Netdata starts, such as after a reboot, the plugins use this list of known services to re-establish metrics collection much more reliably. No more worrying if the service or application you need to monitor starts up minutes after Netdata.Two of our new collectors will help those with Hadoop big data infrastructures. The **HDFS and Zookeeper collection modules** come with essential alarms requested by our community and Netdata's auto-detection capabilities to keep the required configuration to an absolute minimum. Read up on the process via our [HDFS and Zookeeper tutorial](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/monitor-hadoop-cluster/).Speaking of new collectors—we also added the ability to collect metrics from SLAB cache, Gearman, and vCenter Server Appliances.Before v1.18, if you wanted to create alarms for each dimension in a single chart, you need to write separate entities for each dimension—not very efficient or user-friendly. New **dimension templates** fix that hassle. Now, a single entity can automatically generate alarms for any number of dimensions in a chart, even those you weren't aware of! Our [tutorial on dimension templates](https://docs.netdata.cloud/docs/tutorials/dimension-templates/) has all the details.v1.18 brings support for installing Netdata on offline or air-gapped systems. To help users comply with strict security policies, our installation scripts can now install Netdata using previously-downloaded tarball and checksums instead of downloading them at runtime. We have guides for installing offline via **kickstart.sh** or **kickstart-static64.sh** in our [installation documentation](https://docs.netdata.cloud/packaging/installer/#offline-installations) . We're excited to bring real-time monitoring to once-inaccessible systems!**Improvements**- **Database Engine**    - Make dbengine the default memory mode    - Increase dbengine default cache size     - Reduce overhead during write IO     - Detect deadlock in dbengine page cache     - Remove hard cap from page cache size to eliminate deadlocks- **New Collectors**    - [SLAB cache mechanism](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/slabinfo.plugin/)    - [Gearman worker statistics](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/python.d.plugin/gearman/)    - [vCenter Server Appliance](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/vcsa/)    - [Zookeeper servers](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/zookeeper/)    - [Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) nodes](https://docs.netdata.cloud/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/hdfs/)- **Collector Improvements**    - rabbitmq: Add vhosts message metrics from /api/vhosts     - elasticsearch: collect metrics from _cat/indices    - mysql: collect galera cluster metrics     - Allow configuration of the python.d launch command from netdata.conf     - [x509check](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/x509check): smtp cert check support    - [dnsmasq_dhcp](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/dnsmasq_dhcp) : respect conf-dir,conf-file,dhcp-host options     - plugin: respect previously running jobs after plugin restart    - [httpcheck](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/httpcheck) : add current state duration chart     - [springboot2](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/tree/master/modules/springboot2): fix context- **Health**    - Enable alarm templates for chart dimensions     - Center the chart on the proper chart and time whenever an alarm link is clicked - **Installation/Packages**    - netdata/installer: Add support for offline installations using kickstart.sh or kickstart-static64.sh     - Allow netdata service installation, when docker runs systemd     - Make spec file more consistent with version dependencies    - Fix broken links on web files, for DEB     - Introduce separate CUPS package for DEB #6724 and RPM.

The No-at-All Attack;[removed];> We can conclude that 58% of the respondents are NOT familiar with the term “MAC address randomization” and that only 8% replied that they use MAC address randomization on some of their devices. However, these results indicate that the majority of people are not familiar with MAC randomization, whereas very few are actually using it.Sorry, but I think these findings cast a ridiculous amount of doubt on your research. Where in the world did you find a group where 42% of people were familiar with MAC randomization? The average user doesn’t even know what a MAC address is, let alone why they’d need to randomize it. I’d be surprised if you went to a CS undergrad class and 42% of the class understood what randomization isz Secondly, your conclusion that because none of the probes had the “locally administrated address bit” set  that all MACs were unique and non-random is missing the point. MAC randomization happens over a larger time frame. Yes, you can track me as I move through a space based on my transmissions. This is a necessary evil as a constant address for a period is the only way for other stations to speak to you. Randomization, however, DOES CORRECTLY kick in over a longer period (hours). This rollover interval is decided by each manufacturer more or less arbitrarily. This means that if you see my device’s probe requests today, you’ll see them from a different address tomorrow. This prevents *long term* tracking which is far more important because it prevents a malicious observer from building a history of a single human.#Thank you on the feedback! I am glad that there is someone who read the paper and wanted to inform me about it.I am still undergrad student (21y) on CS studies, our University has 3 years CyberSec. degree studies not cybersec. undergrad class, the participants on the survey were our colleagues, professors etc. The point was to see how much do they know about MAC randomization because the problem is that many of the people working in Computer Science are not even familiar with the term and what about those who are not into computer science at all.The paper was short, We have multiple research labs and working hard to extend and make the point on the rollover interval indeed. But in this paper we express our concerns about the effectiveness of this solution, five years after it was introduced  for the first time, and whether is sufficient enough to prevent users from  tracking even in a short period of time.

BankingInfo;dj1xdw;1571290661.0;/r/BankingInfo/comments/dj1xdw/industry_apathy_remains_as_sftr_deadline_looms/;Industry apathy remains as SFTR deadline looms;With six months to go until the reporting deadline for the EU’s Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (SFTR), there remains a worrying level of apathy and unreadiness in the industry, according to market participants.SFTR is looming on the horizon for the industry“Industry surveys show there is a lack of preparedness in the industry and there is a worrying [amount] of organisations who will not be ready by the go-live date,” says Sunil Daswani, SFTR consultant specialist at MarketAxess.SFTR aims to increase transparency on the use as repos and securities lending transactions, and on the risks around entering collateral arrangements.    Both financial and non-financial companies will be required to report such transactions to approved trade repositories.The types of firms affected include banks, investment firms, CCPs, CSDs, insurance, reinsurance undertakings, pension funds, UCITs, AIFs and non-financial counterparties.“While phase one go live implementation is from April 2020, phase two and three organisations still need to prepare if they are trading with a phase one counterparty,” adds Daswani. “These organisations will not be able to ignore preparations until their own go-live deadline.”**Related: [The power of technology to bridge regulatory gaps](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/10/mandates-and-machines-the-power-of-technology-to-bridge-regulatory-gaps/)**Saeed Patel, director of product strategy at KRM22, says: “There is a degree of apathy in the financial industry on the level and magnitude of recent regulatory change experienced. As a consequence, we believe the industry has been late in preparing for SFTR with compliance and IT resources stretched and waiting until the last minute to launch project initiatives.”Patel finds that budgetary concerns have been placing pressure on compliance team headcounts and technology investment in recent years.“There is no question that firms must start to prepare now to comply with the regulatory timetable for the April 2020 go-live.”“SFTR reporting obligations add another level of complexity on transaction reporting when compared to the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid II), with greater level of data fields required to be reported and a new set of validation and conditional rules to comply with,” adds Patel.Daniel Percy-Hughes, director of regulatory change and compliance at Synechron, believes that the biggest challenges are likely to come from firms’ own organisational structures.“Firms whose application stack makes it difficult to change have a higher regression risk, which will face more difficulty than those firms who are already designing and building more scalable solutions,” says Percy-Hughes. These institutions would deploy solutions such as APIs and microservices, or embrace cloud based big data technologies. “Technology, budget and culture all play a part in this,” he adds.**See more: [ISLA tells lenders to avoid “unsustainable risk”](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/09/isla-tells-lenders-how-to-avoid-unsustainable-levels-of-cost-and-risk/)**Unique transaction identifiers (UTI) generation and sharing is still a major hurdle that organisations should address, according to Daswani. “To satisfy the dual nature of requirements, UTIs need to be shared between counterparties.”The challenge is to consistently report on both sides of the transaction. This means being able to not only generate and share UTIs but also accept them from a counterparty.“There are choices to be made around best practice and organisations can choose to follow either a waterfall or bilateral agreement. Organisations need to make fast decisions here, especially for those who still need to determine what their chosen provider to assist in SFTR reporting can do for them relative to internal capabilities,” says Daswani.Regulators will want to set an example early on in the case of non-compliance. “For those who do not comply, there is a risk of being made an example of by the regulator and the consequent potential reputation risk. In addition, there are potentially significant costs associated with non-compliance.“There are industry rumours that the phase one go live deadline may shift – especially given this is currently set for Easter weekend, which from experience isn’t a good time to implement, particularly from an operational perspective.” However, Daswani does believe that there may be a short period of leniency while organisations adapt and address teething issues.For Percy Hughes, as with many other types of transaction reporting, non-compliance means that reporting is incomplete or inaccurate, rather than non-existent. “The most obvious impact to the market is that transparency is of less value than it otherwise might be, and the regulator has information of more limited quality. Firms will face ongoing reconciliation breaks, a backlog of remediation efforts and will always run the ever-present risk of fines.”**Now read: [Delta Capita and DTCC collaborate on SFTR testing](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/09/delta-capita-and-dtcc-collaborate-on-sftr-testing/)**      [* More Details Here](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/10/industry-apathy-remains-as-sftr-deadline-looms/);

In total, 13 fintech lenders now have licences, but there are still 114 companies registered with the OJK which don’t.With the number nearly doubling month-to-month since August, prospects are looking hopeful for those still waiting on a licence to secure one in the next few months.This exponential increase in licence-issuing puts the country well on the way to a responsible form of financial inclusion which is collectively-driven by the industry and the authorities.Recent licence-securer Finmas says it simply wants “to help serve the Indonesian people”, and is “deeply committed to maintaining the highest standards of transparency, security and strong corporate governance in accordance with OJK regulations and code of ethics”.Finmas’ director of compliance Reza Pratama continues: “This process sends a strong message to the industry and other regulators across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).”Another newly-licensed lender, Investree, expects the OJK’s license to P2P lending firms will “give more trust to the public and investors in a bid to expand the number of borrowers, lenders and the loan distribution, giving more financial access to the whole Indonesian community”.

There was way too much to take in over the three days for me to do justice to here, but here are a few of the key takeaways from this year’s edition of our New York showcase.**The resurgence of personal finance is a lesson for innovators**The very first personal finance management (PFM) solution I ever saw was on stage at FinovateFall 2010 (roughly ten months after I joined the Finovate team). Yodlee’s APIs were still brand new at that point, and we had a couple of different companies who were using their technology to give banking customers the first account aggregation/budgeting tools.PFMs continued to evolve, getting prettier and more effective, and by 2014 or 2015, it felt like the technology had gone just about as far as it could go. While the technology looked good (and I still maintain that most people would benefit from more awareness of their finances and active budgeting exercises), it was becoming clear that most end-users weren’t too interested in the technology. By 2016, we were getting steady feedback from attendees that they considered personal finance solutions to be more “boring” than “innovative”, and they wanted us to stop putting them on stage.Fast forward to FinovateFall 2019, and the idea that personal finance was “boring” is looking pretty laughable. While nobody was showing a monthly budgeting or expense-categorisation tool, we had several companies on stage who were demoing solutions that are taking PFM to a new level. Instead of focusing on the day-to-day expenses, these companies were tackling the biggest financial decisions that people have to make, ranging from solutions that help students decide how much college debt they can take on to solutions that can help families prepare for unexpected financial shocks like a major illness, divorce, or the unexpected arrival of a new child.Getting these major financial decisions right is absolutely vital for long-term financial health. So is being able to anticipate how major life events will affect your finances. Innovations in this area have the very real potential to make a huge impact on the everyday lives of millions of people, and they represent a win for banks and their customers. Not too boring now, is it?The work being done by early innovators in the PFM space is enabling the resurgence of personal finance we’re seeing now, and with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that PFM innovation didn’t reach and endpoint, it just reached a plateau. Unfortunately, it plateaued in a place that wasn’t very appealing to end-users. The solution, though, wasn’t to abandon it  it was to keep pushing it forward, taking it to a place where it could offer more value and more insight.Will these new takes on personal financial wellness be popular with customers? Only time will tell. But by adding more value, tackling harder questions, and responding more effectively to the pain points of real consumers, it’s pretty clear that personal finance is very alive, and very relevant for the banking industry.For innovators, the lesson is clear: if you’re “bored” with a subset of fintech, don’t abandon it – think about how you can push it forward into someplace exciting.**The rising importance of AI is rippling across fintech**[As I wrote after FinovateSpring](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/06/finovatespring-2019-focusing-on-the-digital-future-of-fintech/) earlier this year, artificial intelligence (AI) is officially here, and the fintech world is shifting because of it. More and more fintechs are using AI in their product stacks, and that’s creating a ripple effect in two key areas: data, and security.If AI is the engine that will power fintech innovation in the next few years, data is its fuel. The quality of that fuel was a key topic at FinovateFall, both among the presenting companies on stage and the attendees around the room.Machine learning (ML) is made possible by large data sets that can “train” a computer to predict the most likely outcomes. The more data it has, the more accurate a machine can become. It’s not just the quantity of data that matters, though, it’s the quality. If you feed AI flawed or incomplete data, you’re going to get flawed or incomplete results. Innovators are responding to this need by offering tech solutions specifically designed to harness, organise and clean data and make it ready for AI. While big data has been a key topic in fintech for a few years now, its importance is skyrocketing, and the industry is responding.The importance of data is also flowing into the security space. Storing personal data securely has always been a priority for banks, and fintech has always had a very robust security sector. Up until now, though, the data that was being secured was more static in nature. By and large, financial institutions simply needed that data to sit somewhere safely until it could be referenced or amended with new account information.Now that data needs to be used in AI solutions, it needs to move to more places, go through more processes, and be seen by more people (and machines). Balancing the usability of data with the obligation to keep it secure at every step of the way is adding a new dimension to the security space, and as AI continues to grow, the size of the problem will continue to grow as well.**Make room for the new kids on the block**FinovateFall 2019 featured more seed-stage and early-stage startups on stage than any of our other shows in recent memory. It’s great to see the creative ideas coming from these new companies, and making sure there’s room in fintech for challengers is vital to the ecosystem. Fintech’s search for “unicorns” will (and should) continue, but complacency is the death of progress, and fresh ideas are the death of complacency.No company exhibited this more successfully than Zogo Finance, whose founder Bolun Li became the youngest innovator to win a [Best of Show trophy](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/09/finovatefall-2019-best-of-show-winners-unveiled/) at a Finovate event. Zogo leverages partnerships with financial institutions to reward kids for learning financial literacy. As someone who sat through (and admittedly made fun of) financial literacy programs designed by banks for kids just three years ago, Bolun is well-positioned to challenge the status quo.

BankingInfo;dfsl5v;1570680286.0;/r/BankingInfo/comments/dfsl5v/ai_understanding_bias_and_opportunities_in/;AI: Understanding bias and opportunities in financial services;It is undeniable that our lives have been made better by artificial intelligence (AI). AI technology allow us to get almost anything, anytime, anywhere in the world at the click of a button  prevent disease epidemics and keep them from spiralling out of control, and generally just make day-to-day life a bit easier by helping us to save energy, book a babysitter, manage our cash and our health all at a very low cost.AI’s penetration into systems and processes in virtually all sectors of business and life has been rapid and global. The speed and scale at which AI is proliferating does however raise the question of how at-risk we may be that the AI we are building for good can also be introducing damaging bias at scale.In this two-part series, I explore the issues with AI constructs, the good bad and the ugly and how we can think about shaping a future through AI in financial services that helps lift people up rather than scaling problems up.By Nadia Sood, CreditEnablePart One**AI in financial services: The good**From using predictive analysis to forecast consumer spending and advising on personal wealth management, to underwriting loans and transaction monitoring – AI’s footprint in financial services can be seen everywhere.AI that has focused on better understanding of customer’s needs and security can have substantial benefits for consumers and several banks have already introduced innovation in this space.In 2018, Goldman Sachs acquired a personal finance app called ClarityMoney. The app pulls users’ transaction information to remind them of spending goals, flags transactions that it finds unusual for a given account, and also moves money into savings for users. It also calculates how much users could save if they cancel some recurring fees in their bank account and even allows users to cancel unwanted subscriptions in just a few steps. This kind of technology revolutionises tracking personal finance.NetOwl is a suite of entity analytics products used by Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). It analyses big data in the form of reports, social media, as well as structured entity data about organisations and places. It uses tools such as semantic search and discovery, compliance monitoring, cyber threat monitoring and risk management. It can even translate names written in foreign languages, perform name matching, and identity resolution. RBC uses the company’s tool EntityMatcher as part of its fraud detection and prevention efforts. Using this software, RBC is able to screen potential new customers against a large set of individuals who have perpetrated fraud against such organisations in the past. NetOwl is able to quickly and accurately match newly identified perpetrators against millions of records. This kind of technology not only benefits the bank using it, but also helps reduce the likelihood that nefarious organisations penetrate the institutions that the rest of society needs in order to function.**What can go wrong**While this technology offers immense benefits, it can equally help perpetuate unhealthy biases. Imagine that your expense tracking software was used by your bank to determine whether you should be eligible for a loan product, but filtered out all people over the age of 50 because the algorithm was constructed by a young technologist assigning a value in an algorithm and who just assumed over 50s didn’t need loans? This would not bring a benefit to over 50-year olds or to the banks who would be missing out on a huge part of a creditworthy pool of customers.Real world examples of this type of bias creeping in with detrimental consequences to women and minorities have already occurred and at scale.In 2014, Amazon developed an internal AI tool for selecting the most promising candidates by examining their job applications, particularly their CVs. However, the software quickly taught itself to prefer male candidates over female ones, penalising CVs that included the words ‘women’, which would often refer to women-only clubs. The software also downgraded graduates from two all-women colleges. This issue stemmed from the fact that this software was trained on data submitted by mostly men over a ten-year period. Despite attempts to fix the bias, Amazon eventually lost faith in the impartiality of the system and abandoned the project. Commenting on this issue, John Jersin, VP of LinkedIn Talent Solutions stated that AI is not ready to make a hiring decision on its own – the technology is not ready just yet. The real issue with the AI that was deployed wasn’t that it wasn’t ready, but rather that the starting point was flawed. The data set used should have included an equal set of data on women and on men, and because it didn’t, the eventual decisioning tool that was constructed by Amazon ended up with an inherent bias against women.These systems are often tested predominately on white men.A similar issue has occurred in the area of AI for facial analysis. A computer scientist and MIT graduate, Joy Buolamwini, found that facial analysis software from tech giants such as IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon, could not detect her dark skin. Her face was only detected when she put on a white mask. This is not surprising as these systems are often tested predominately on white men.After testing facial recognition from these tech giants on various faces, Buolamwini found that all companies performed substantially better on male faces than female faces – and darker-skinned female faces did substantially worse. For lighter skinned men, she found an error rate of less than 1%. However, this figure rose to 35% for darker skinned women. These AI systems also failed to correctly classify the faces of Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and Serena Williams despite the fact that these women are some of the most famous people in the world and generate some of the most significant number of images on the internet.In both these examples, the institutions building the AI could have been smarter about the data-sets they used to form their conclusions and train their AI and better about including more diversity in the groups of people who were building the systems.AI in banking is not immune to this risk. The trick is going to be how to develop AI that doesn’t perpetuate widespread bias that exists today especially in the area of gender.Gender bias in banking services is clearly seen around the globe. A European study found that businesswomen are less able to access loans from banks than businessmen. Male entrepreneurs in Europe are 5% more likely to successfully get a loan for their business from banks than women. Even those women that are able to access loans are subjected to higher interest rates, with an average of 0.5% more on a business loan than men. It is not the case here that women are worse at business than men and so present worse credit risks – the average venture-backed technology company run by a woman is started with a third less capital yet yields annual revenues that are 12% higher than those run by men.The substantial social benefit of AI if applied properly is that it can help spotlight the strong performing, good eggs in the lending basket. For instance, it can read between the lines in deciding whether to lend to an individual earlier excluded by a lending officer because the entrepreneur is a woman, especially since the gender of the entrepreneur has nothing to do with the ability of the individual to repay debt. AI can help eliminate the discrimination arising from cases such as this.At a societal level AI stands the chance of democratising the access to capital for women and minorities. But AI needs to be developed in a consequent thoughtful manner for this promise to be delivered on.In the second part of this series, I explore how AI can be applied as a force for good by financial institution to expand the pool of clients to be more inclusive.An objective analysis can highlight what gender biases may cloud – and banks would thus be less likely to filter out women-owned businesses without first being made aware of their merits and creditworthiness. With time, AI can be a transformative tool in shrinking these biases.********_**By Nadia Sood, CEO, CreditEnable.

Business_Analyst;dj4c2f;1571307367.0;/r/Business_Analyst/comments/dj4c2f/secretive_data_firm_palantir_cashed_in_by/;Secretive Data Firm Palantir Cashed In by Skipping the 2019 IPO Market;Named after an all-seeing magical artifact with the power to scry into the past and future of the Lord of the Rings universe, Palo Alto-based Palantir raised $2.75 billion earlier this month for a valuation of $28 billion.That has allowed the secretive company to stay secret for a while longer. While Palantir, backed and founded by President Donald Trump advisor Peter Thiel, has hinted an initial public offering, it’s now not likely to happen until 2023, per a [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-05/palantir-is-said-to-seek-funding-on-private-market-delay-ipo) report. The president of the firm’s French businesses recently revealed that the company had revenue of close to [$1 billion in 2018](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-16/palantir-posted-nearly-1-billion-in-2018-sales-executive-says), but it’s not clear whether the firm is profitable.Its fresh round of funding goes towards a growing a [business based on big data](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-big-data-analysis/)—more specifically organizing, unifying, and making sense of the vast troves of information created by the tech and internet revolution (think chat logs, street cameras, credit card statements, airline records, raw information usually siloed within their own disparate houses, but able to combine into a picture). The company’s software to sort through the disparate data points and find often difficult to spot connections.The 15-year-old company made its [name by working with the Pentagon](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-big-data-analysis/) and CIA through the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and may or may not have played a role in the capture of Osama bin Laden. What does Palantir do?----------------------Beyond its uses in foreign spycraft, Palantir has also been used in police work. The Los Angeles Police Department signed with the company in 2009, and Palantir helped aggregate [several state, federal, and local level databases into one](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Impact-Study-LAPD.pdf) searchable system—one that eventually helped catch a killer nearly two years [after the murder](https://www.wired.com/story/drive-los-angeles-police-track-every-move/). New Orleans meanwhile had been working with Palantir to find potential victims and criminals, though that program ended in 2018, according to [the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/15/17126174/new-orleans-palantir-predictive-policing-program-end). Palantir also helped the Netherlands National Police Services identify a network of child pornographers [in 2010](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Impact_Study_Fighting_Child_Pornography.pdf), by tying names to aliases used in chat logs, Skype records, and more.While its contracts [with the U.S. government](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/) bolstered the company’s profile, it has also branched out by adding corporate clients under its Superman inspired Metropolis system: that includes the likes of banking behemoth JPMorgan Chase.However, the company’s data collection practices have drawn scrutiny.Palantir’s software was reportedly used at JPMorgan to monitor employees, aggregating among other things browser histories, GPS locations from company cell phones, emails, and sign-in times. That information, in turn, could be used to root out not only say a rogue trader or an illicit conversation but also find employees that could potentially be a risk to the company and therefore justify additional monitoring, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/). JPMorgan said it had “drastically” pulled back on the partnership, following a string of other corporate breakups with the company, including Hershy, [Coca-Cola](https://fortune.com/fortune500/coca-cola/), and Nasdaq.In J.R.R. Tolkien’s magnum opus, the seven Palantiri are powerful objects used to communicate and influence those within the trilogy’s universe. It is neither good nor bad—having been used during the storyline to turn a once great and powerful wizard toward the darkness, but also eventually aid in the destruction of the one ring. ‘Dangerous indeed, but not to all,’ said Aragorn, a main character in the story who ultimately uses a Palantir to distract the evil side from its impending defeat.Is Palantir’s technology itself currently in the right hands and being used for the right purposes? Its detractors argue no.Palantir and political controversy----------------------------------Beyond data privacy concerns, Palantir is now being criticized for working with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency—a government arm recently front and center over its role in separating families. The company has worked with ICE since 2014, with ICE is reportedly using a Palantir-built system to conduct background checks (Palantir has said that it specifically works with the cross-border criminal investigations side of ICE, rather than its [immigration enforcement](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/business/dealbook/investor-bias-discrimination.html) division, though recently, that same division was responsible for the arrest of 680 [undocumented migrant workers](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/us/mississippi-immigration-raids-children/index.html)).Outwardly, CEO Alex Karp (who supported Hillary Clinton’s run for president in 2016) has stood by the relationship, echoing again that its product was merely a tool, telling [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-22/the-complicated-politics-of-palantir-s-ceo) shortly after Palantir renewed its contract with ICE earlier this year: “We at Palantir have a view that in societies where there is a functioning democracy—meaning there are checks and balances enforced by a functioning judiciary—we will provide the software and will continue to provide the software.”But internally, Palantir employees have also questioned whether Palantir can take such a hands-off approach. According to [_the Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/22/war-inside-palantir-data-mining-firms-ties-ice-under-attack-by-employees/?arc404=true) citing sources inside the company, some 60 employees signed a petition in August calling for Palantir to direct its financial gains from its ICE contracts to nonprofits.Unlike its fictional counterpart, this Palantir may well be part of those checks and balances as corporations increasingly question their role in democracy.### More must-read stories from _Fortune_:—[Trump’s tax bill has cost homeowners a trillion dollars   ](https://fortune.com/2019/10/10/how-trump-tax-bill-affects-homeowners-middle-class/)—Inside JP Morgan, [moving on from WeWork](https://fortune.com/2019/10/13/jpmorgan-wework-adam-neumann-ipo/) is proving to be a messy proposition    —[What is Oyo?](https://fortune.com/2019/10/14/what-is-oyo-behind-softbanks-latest-high-growth-high-valuation-bet/) Behind Softbank’s latest high-growth, high-valuation bet    —Why the [next recession may feel very different](https://fortune.com/2019/09/02/next-recession-different-2008-great-recession/) than 2008    —Trump’s tariffs were supposed to ding China, but [the U.S. economy is getting hit 2.5x harder   ](https://fortune.com/2019/10/08/trump-china-tariffs-trade-war-us-economy-impact/)_Don’t miss the daily_[_Term Sheet_](https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/nloptin?nl=TERM_SHEET&source=LinkStack)_, Fortune’s newsletter on deals and dealmakers._         [* More Details Here](https://fortune.com/2019/10/17/what-is-palantir-ipo-market-2019/);
Business_Analyst;dflq6r;1570647996.0;/r/Business_Analyst/comments/dflq6r/artificial_intelligence_could_be_a_14_trillion/;Artificial Intelligence Could Be a $14 Trillion Boon to the Global Economy—If It Can Overcome These Obstacles;Global growth is stalling. Trade wars are hammering manufacturers, from Shanghai to Stuttgart to Seattle. But, awful as today’s economic outlook appears, Industry 4.0 is alive and well, its most ardent backers say.Industry 4.0 is the catch-all term for the implementation by businesses of big data, improved robotics and artificial intelligence systems. And it’s still expected to be a major driver in global growth over the next decade, and beyond. Yes, even in manufacturing.By 2035, this A.I.-powered push will provide a $14 trillion boost to the global economy, consulting giant Accenture predicts.That’s the assessment of Marc Carrel-Billiard, global senior managing director at Accenture Labs, who rattled off these numbers during his keynote presentation at [World Summit A.I.](https://info.worldsummit.ai/eventprogramme) in Amsterdam on Wednesday. By way of example, he cited research that traced the progress in one growing area of A.I.-powered automation: call centers. Five years ago, A.I. bots could successfully resolve one out every ten customer phone calls. Today, he said, it’s 60%.Moreover, he predicted, this push to automate will not be the jobs-killer the more bearish economists out there fear.But before technologists take a victory lap, there’s a caveat.They’re not a threat to jobs, he says, “because these systems are not very intelligent.” AI—and its many iterations: machine learning, natural language processing, machine vision, image- and voice-recognition—is well adapted at highly specialized tasks. It does a decent job telling you what the weather will be tomorrow, or ordering movie tickets or helping you find the fastest route home during the evening commute. All manner of businesses are using A.I. increasingly on the enterprise level to make sense of the vast flows of structured and unstructured data they collect to root out inefficiencies, and save costs.But, as Carrel-Billiard notes, A.I. still has a blind spot. It’s trained to interpret certain data sets, not infer meaning or context from a complicated world. A.I. is a specialist, not a generalist, he says. And therefore, much work is needed to make these systems truly intelligent.Gary Marcus, professor of psychology and neural science at New York University and author of _[Rebooting AI](http://rebooting.ai/)_, is even more frank in his assessment. He calls deep learning— the subset of A.I. that can make sense of huge amounts of data with little to no oversight from human minders—a misnomer. It’s good at narrowly focused tasks, but he questions its much-ballyhooed potential to, for example, revolutionize transportation (self-driving cars) and medicine (analyzing huge volumes of MRI scans for signs of cancerous growths). “Deep learning is no substitute for deep understanding,” he says.“The number of radiologists who’ve been replaced by deep-learning systems?” he asks. “Zero.”Carrel-Billiard, for one, believes that in order for A.I. systems to be truly effective they need to be designed to be accountable, transparent and free of bias—not just super-fast task rabbits. Only then will such systems reach their full potential.On day one of the World Summit A.I., much of the early discussion was about the need to build so-called ethical A.I. systems. Marcus and Carrel-Billiard, among others, challenged the development community to build A.I. systems that are accountable, transparent and free of bias.Unless it’s responsible, Carrel-Billiard says, “nobody will trust it, and nobody will use it.”### More must-read stories fromFortune:—How[the man who nailed Madoff](https://fortune.com/2019/10/03/ge-accounting-markopolos-madoff/)got [GE](https://fortune.com/fortune500/general-electric/) wrong   —[Most Powerful Women 2019](https://fortune.com/most-powerful-women/2019): See who made the list   —Meet the women leading [Netflix](https://fortune.com/fortune500/netflix/) into[the streaming wars   ](https://fortune.com/longform/women-netflix-streaming-wars/)—Why[the next recession](https://fortune.com/2019/09/02/next-recession-different-2008-great-recession/)may feel very different than 2008   —Old Navy is about to[sail away from Gap Inc.](https://fortune.com/longform/old-navy-gap-inc-split-ceo-sonia-syngal-challenges-sales/)—and into some choppy waters   Subscribe to Fortune’s[The Loop newsletter](https://cloud.newsletters.fortune.com/fortune/nloptin?nl=the_loop&source=LinkStack)for the latest on the revolutions in energy, technology, and sustainability.

As digital citizens, it’s our responsibility to keep track of the issues that matter – writes*** [Nayef Al-Rodhan]^^1 ***.***When the newly appointed European Commissioners officially take up their posts on 1st November, some very important technology policy questions will once again come into view. These are decisions that could fundamentally reshape the business models of Big Tech firms, redraw the landscape of competition and affirm Europe as the dominant global rule maker when it comes powerful tech companies and the effects they have on our politics and culture.It is indispensable that we keep checks on technological progress. Human innovation is advancing at breakneck speeds. Things we never dreamed of are becoming reality, such as synthetic biology, bioinformatics, cognitive enhancement, genetic engineering, 3D and 4D printing, Artificial intelligence, automated weapon systems, invisibility cloaks, quantum computing and even neuromorphic computing.  Along with their obvious massive potential, these advancements also pose significant risks to social stability, equality, human dignity, free will, national and global security, and even to the very survival of our species.How can we make sure that these constantly evolving technological innovations don’t destroy humanity or exacerbate inequalities and privacy intrusions? Emerging technologies offer states more instruments and means for control and surveillance, often infringing on civil liberties. The balance between States’ need to know in the name of security and the respect for privacy must be pursued more fervently. Also non-state actors like large multi-national corporate entities that collect massive amounts of personal data, need to be better regulated.We must balance the dizzying potentials of technological advancements with security and ethical concerns, and move from risks to regulations. This must also include mechanisms for overseeing the overseers – or ‘regulating the regulators’, so it is equally important that we are aware of the powers that be when it comes to regulating the global landscape.Their ambition must be to promote my previously published governance-based  [9 dignity needs]^^2  – which include*: reason, security, human rights, accountability, transparency, justice, opportunity, innovation, and inclusiveness*, and balance them with the 3 human nature attributes : *emotionality, amorality and egoism –* without stifling innovation.In the race to regulate Big Tech, it has in recent years become overwhelmingly clear that the first mover becomes the primary global rule maker.  The group of policymakers first able to put forward a vision of regulation at global level has an evident advantage – enabling them to pressure other regulatory bodies into embracing their rules, even when contrary to their domestic agendas.With a large market of 500 million citizens, the majority of whom are comparatively wealthy on a global scale, and equipped with the ability to coordinate action on controversial issues such as privacy, competition, and digital tax, the EU has established itself as the world’s regulatory pacesetter.In these spheres, the EU has projected itself onto the global stage with particular force in the last year and a half, by advancing its regulatory prerogatives within the agendas of international forums such as the G7 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).Crucially, Brussels is emerging as the most important formulator of antitrust regulation. Earlier this year, European officials published a report which pushed for regulators to more heavily scrutinize proposed takeovers based on how companies used data.Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s highly interventionist competition commissioner, who has launched several high profile cases against Google, Amazon and Apple, has been reappointed to her role for an unprecedented second term. So the trend that has been set in motion on these issues is looking likely to continue, if not grow stronger. She has already recently warned Silicon Valley that she will move beyond fines during her second term and look at other measures to ensure a fair playing field.Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming head of the EU’s executive arm, has hinted at new laws on artificial intelligence and the use of big data within 100 days of taking office next month.  She and her team are also reportedly considering creating a dedicated multibillion-euro fund to support and promote the European technology sector.As digital consumers around the globe continue to pay closer attention to their relationships with companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple — whose users number in the billions worldwide — it seems inevitable that one region needs to begin taking the lead in debating and implementing appropriate forms of regulation.Effective decision-making by the next Commission, undertaken with the aim of defending basic rights while energising digital markets through the principles of fairness and competition could have the potential to revolutionise the digital economy – bringing about a world in which there are many more winners, rather than a small number of companies whose established advantages skew the market in favour of monopolies. What remains to be seen is whether these difficult but necessary questions will be tackled head on, or conveniently avoided.'''[Governing the Global Commons - EU Reporter](https://reddit.com//r/europe/comments/dl1583)[Go1dfish undelete link](http://r.go1dfish.me/r/europe/comments/dl1583)[unreddit undelete link](https://unreddit.com/r/europe/comments/dl1583)Author: /u/NayefAlRodhan1: `www.*ust**n*blehi****y.com*about-nay*f*alr*dhan`  2: `blo*.ap*on**ne.**g/2*18/**/16/a-*eu*o-phi*o*op**-of**i*nity-ba*ed-governance/`  Unknown links are censored to prevent                         spreading illicit content.;

From its modest beginnings a couple of years prior as an idea in the brains of researchers, big data has turned into a backbone in the business world. Organizations needed to change their advertising. They would need to filter through their business information, click-through and general behavior of their audience. According to a survey, 99% of businesses are going to implement big data analytics and [**AI**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/using-artificial-intelligence-in-your-business/) in the near future. The telecom industry, financial services and healthcare are the industries to have embraced big data with technology. There are various ways you can utilize big data to plan your business model to improve things in advertising. Let us see how [**big data**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/deciding-the-need-of-a-big-data-infrastructure/) can help your business to succeed.  ## Five Ways Big Data Can Help Your Business To Grow- ### 1. Data transfer-As new businesses start to work on problem solving issues and also administrations, a catch-22 situation frequently emerges. At one side, there is not sufficient data to build a definite product on. On the other, the information with which such an item can be made is often difficult to get without setting off to the market with a minimum viable product first. Consider the possibility that the curve could be minimized and the innovation procedure quickened. That is the thing that information sharing does–interfacing businesses to the datasets they have to derive innovative insights. The integrity of the data will draw more companies to participate since they’ll be able to rely on the accuracy of the data.### 2. Marketing-Personalization has consistently been a need for advertisers. Businesses have endeavored to utilize personalization to shape a closer bond with clients in mail merges, PPC retargeting campaigns and businesses also. It’s reason is so simple- the more associated an individual feels with a brand, the more probable they are to work with it. Appropriate execution of big data analytics will enable you to improve product data and also foresee client inclinations in a manner that expands conversations. Contacting more individuals is never again the need- the most significant factor in marketing success is targeted people, who are likely to buy at just the right time. From deciding the request in which to present products to creating particularly targeted email advertising campaigns, more information in your customer relationship management(CRM) software rises to more chances to engage with clients on an individual level.  ### 3. Security-Rise in online transactions results in increase of fraud rates. Hackers have brought down a few businesses online and offline with the malware attacks like the infamous Wannacry virus, less sophisticated but equally devastating social engineering attacks. Losing client information to an attack can decimate your business’ reputation, aside from the money related losses which would almost certainly happen. Big data allows organizations to implement software which would expand protects on delicate data by utilizing on an assortment of technologies including video recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, machine learning engines and also automation.### 4. Customer Service and Retention-[**Chatbots**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/how-to-create-engaging-chatbots-for-your-business/) have just turned out to be very popular as a methods for organizations to give high level customer service without the customary time, budget and also staffing requirements. Another way big data can boost your business’s customer satisfaction is by guiding to help you to design customer responsive products and services. Using right dataset, you can analyze and find the features which your customers prize the most and which ones you need to eliminate. The data can be from surveys, polls or tracking technologies, research.### 5. Human Resource-While HR executives is commonly best served by having a human make a final decision, workforce data analytics can be hugely helpful for HR staff in any organization. The method of matching keywords to job descriptions for shortlisting candidates is no longer effective. Because there are so many points to consider before making a hiring decision apart from mentioned on a resume. Data driven AI projects can quickly assess education, experience, skill sets, job titles, certifications, geography, social media activity, background checks and a variety of other parameters to recognize the best candidate for a position. The quality of staff delivered by such an escalated procedure will reflect in the higher productivity and also benefit of your business;I get enough of this bullshit spam in my inbox at work.

I kind of help design applications, do POC's/prototyping, code/develop applications. I earn a healthy salary and support my family well.I started my career in Mainframes, then forced myself to transition to ETL/datawarehousing (SQL, Ab Initio, Netezza, Oracle etc). I moved to Big Data(thanks to my boss) with zero experience and a salary hit  and have been working on on-prem hadoop for the past few yrs. Tech stack is - Python/Hive/Impala/PySpark/Python to name a few. Currently prototyping with Scala/Kudu/kafka (by learning just enough for my use case).I have always survived by learning just enough on the job with no formal training except for Mainframes. Since, I have always learned on the job, everything I know is through my experience and practice - thus leading to less theoretical/foundational knowledge. I don't get enough time to get the foundation right on anything.Since, I don't come from oops background, I have always found it diff to understand oops concepts. I find JAVA/Scala diff to grasp. I seem to have a mental block against Java/Scala/Oops concepts. If you give me a problem, I can find a solution and get the work done. This quality of mine along with my work ethic has helped me throughout. Even though I have bosses who have trust and confidence in me and have high opinion on my skills, I personally don't and consider myself average.I am that person who can get things done, but, can't say I am good at this one thing.How can I improve and move forward in my career?;

I copied a bunch of files from my Win10 machine over to it, then setup in esxi a win2k16 server and attached this as a 2nd drive. I set up plex and started having loading issues. I thought maybe that 1 file was bad, so I copied that old directory again and windows was giving a bunch of errors. I do a uninterruptible copy app and had errors all over. I disconnect and put it back into my desktop, same files erroring out, did a hdd smart check and said all is good. I copy all the files over to it again and put it back into the esxi server.Same behavior, I try and copy existing folders again as a test and fails/errors all over.So as another test I just formated it in VMware and set it as 1 big data store and mounted that on to the server. So far no errors, and I keep copying 200gb folders over and over to test and it still seems good.So is there an inherent risk with the passthrough?My machine isn't standard, its a simple dell 7040 and the hdd in question is a new WD red drive.;

Data is only a record of the past. Big data has become a big issue in our society because of the trend in the U.S., not because of the argument of our experts. Government officials don't even know that there is now a significant drop in interest in big data in the U.S. The head of Obama's big data team said, ""Big data is bullshit.""I'm not writing this to remind you that big data is useless. I'm just saying they have to break their fantasies about big data. Big data is a technology that can revolutionize things when they are used in the Internet of Things. But it is not the word that we can predict the future. This has also been proven in Google's flu prediction program, which uses big data.";What's your point again?

These things you need to know about it.;&#x200B https://preview.redd.it/2bwy7xbkyor31.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9b5921de7edaff0b91425d6b7e876edad589157October 8, 2019, we are excited to announce that the DxChain Mainnet Alpha is officially launched!  Autumn is the season of harvest. After the release of DxChain Testnet 3.0, the DxChain team has been working hard to complete the commitment and finally brought the achievement of this stage to our community — DxChain Mainnet Alpha, which showcases the construction of master chain has basically finished, and features such as smart contracts, storage contracts, DPoS consensus algorithms, mining and so on have been implemented and work stably.  What’s the meaning of Mainnet Alpha?  It is well known that mainnet is the fundamental of a blockchain project, cryptocurrency is not a real blockchain technology until the Mainnet launch. Any concepts, ideas or theories are unrealizable. DxChain has been committed to building a secure and efficient decentralized big data storage and computing network from the beginning. The construction, development and performance of DxChain network are what DxChain engineers caring about.  The release of DxChain Mainnet Alpha represents that DxChain has basically completed the construction of the public chain framework, in which smart contracts, storage contracts, DPoS consensus algorithms, mining and other functions have been developed  also represents DxChain's transformation from cryptocurrency to a real public chain. There will be more commercial applications and greater ecosystems established on DxChain in the future. DxChain is about to change from a line of code to a blockchain project that can generate real technical value for the real world!  Highlights of DxChain Mainnet Alpha  To better support the new economy model, DxChain engineers conducted an in-depth study on algorithms. In this release, the DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus algorithm was implemented to replace the previously used PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm.  PoW, the most long-lived consensus algorithm in the blockchain world, requires some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. However, the costly and time-consuming characteristics are not applicable to the economic model of DxChain.  DPoS, considered to be an improved version of the PoS (Proof of Stake) algorithm, is a more democratic consensus algorithm. The form is similar to the election of the United States Congress that the holder of the cryptocurrency can vote for the representative. The representative's duty is to conduct transaction verification and generate the blocks. Conversely, the holder of the cryptocurrency has the right to reelection if the representative fails to fulfill his/her duties.  Nowadays, DPoS as a consensus mechanism is applied to more and more cryptocurrencies. The elected nodes are responsible for generating blocks and verification, greatly reducing the generation time and confirmation time, and greatly increasing the total throughput of the chain. DxChain stores the scene. Compared with Bitcoin takes 10 minutes, DxChain only takes 2\~10 seconds to generate a block. In addition, after the implementation of the DPoS algorithm, DxChain's TPS (transactions per second) will leap to nearly a thousand to guarantee the contract processing speed on the chain.  Figure1. DxChain DPoS Process  Future Plan  The DxChain team has a solid plan to fulfill all goals and will complete one task after another step by step. In the last quarter of 2019, we are fully sprinting to the goal of Mainnet. The main working content includes (but not limited to):  Getting on large-scale testing for network security and stability  Implementing DPoS rewarding and punishment system, optimizing DPoS algorithm  Optimizing storage-related features, increasing the data upload and download speed  Adding support on Windows operating system  In terms of the release this time, we will gradually hold a series of community events and invite more DxChain supporters and blockchain technology enthusiasts to participate in the testing, so as to jointly promote the DxChain ecosystem construction and development.  Please stay tuned to the events upcoming shortly!

See video here: [https://youtu.be/do\_aeA7ZRIk](https://youtu.be/do_aeA7ZRIk)Total time from takeoff to touchdown is 1h 38m 11s.  Total number of jumps is 76 hops (including all refueling stops), which is about 27% shorter than the best route computed by the Spansh Neutron Router, and about 11% shorter than the previous record time (credit: CMDR St4r Fox).To find this route, I implemented my own A\* search algorithm that exhaustively computes optimal routes from EDSM star map data, taking into account jump range increases due to fuel consumption, and fast refueling opportunities due to main sequence stars co-located with neutron stars.Efficiently computing non-approximate, optimal routes under these constraints turns out to be a fun programming challenge.  The EDSM database contains over 41M stars, over 1.3M of which are neutron stars, forming a large search graph of about 1.8 x 10\^12 edges.  To reduce the search space without sacrificing route quality, I found I could compute jump neighborhoods without big data structures by sorting star data into stripes in the x-y plane, and then using a combination of binary search, pairwise heaps, memory-mapped files, and Intel SSE intrinsics for fast distance calculations.  On my 2.8GHz PC, this approach finds optimal routes (without approximation) in about 1 minute with a memory footprint of under 1GB, despite the volume of data.Interestingly, the algorithm concluded that adding an 8T fuel tank to my Anaconda improves efficiency, at least for this trip, contrary to prevailing wisdom.  Even though it makes the ship heavier, it reduces refueling stops enough to offset its weight.Credit goes to CMDR furrycat for reverse-engineering the equations that govern FSD booster fuel consumption, and the many explorers who have contributed star data to EDSM!Happy flying!

Did you try reducing the range per jump in your calculations and see if that makes you overall faster because you are consuming less fuel?

It comes down to would you rather stop to refuel, or lose range from carrying extra fuel.  I think I determined 64T was ideal for me.  That was a surprise as I'd been carrying 48 before then.

Made me chuckle#I just mean that most people seem to think lighter is generally better, making that the prevailing wisdom even if, as you pointed out, it's not always correct.  However, bigger fuel tanks are not always better either because the equations are non-monotonic, especially when neutron-jumping.  For example, having an extra (non-empty) 32T tank can force you to ""go around"" voids between stars with many, many extra jumps, outweighing the benefits of fewer refueling stops.  That's why I used graph theory and cost equations to estimate trade-offs rather than following any general rule.#Exactly.  Or type it in.#I believe he accomplished this with a macro that auto c&p from a txt file.#I've wondered that myself.  I don't know what algorithm they're using over at FDev, but I'd be very curious to find out.  They've done an amazing job handling a lot of tricky graph theory and big-data problems with this game.  But I'm cautiously optimistic that my approach would improve upon theirs for plotting neutron routes.  If any lurking FDev programmers want to discuss, I'll happily chat with them. :)#The equation is the one reverse-engineered by CMDR furrycat [here](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/the-science-of-the-guardian-fsd-booster-2-0.436365/).  Just takes a lot of number-crunching to use it productively (and safely).#It's all in the video. :)#Reducing the jump range beyond the addition of the 8T tank increases the number of required jumps more than it reduces the number of refueling stops.  Whether that trade-off is worthwhile is hard to assess because it depends on how time-efficient you are at supercharging and refueling.  Since this was my first attempt at using this method, I decided on a cost equation that favors fewer jumps when the numbers are pretty close, since it reduces the risk of human piloting error while supercharging, and I'm not the greatest pilot.#I wrote my program in C (and assembly code if you count the Intel intrinsics) for speed.  The algorithms I used are all well-known (listed in the original post) so anyone can reproduce it.  Whether I release my particular implementation probably depends on how much time I have to make it usable and readable.  There are also some strange things about ED's fuel and weight equations that I still don't understand, and those would probably need to be corrected before it was generally usable.  So it's a work in progress.#Colonia is a mini-bubble, about 22000 ly away from Sol. Compared to the early days, it’s possible to live out there - there’s plenty of ship modules, engineers, and so on, lots of decent mining and trading opportunities. Plus, you can go exploring and find systems first within 2-3 jumps.https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Colonia#Yes, neutrons co-located with scoopable stars are prioritized by my cost function, since it saves a jump.#Good to know!  Thank you!  I indeed had trouble convincing ED to let me equip the modules I wanted.  I still don't know what order to equip things  I just keep trying until it lets me.#Not necessarily. We still don't know how often the carriers will need to be refueled, how hard the fuel is to find, and if there's a cooldown timer on how often they can jump. There's still a possibility, but you have to consider game mechanics that have yet to be implemented.#Seems unlikely.  All the Sagitarrius A\* records are held by Anacondas.  If you think you can beat it in a DBX go ahead.  Also he's not using that build, he said he had a standard tank + 8 ton extra.#Out of a Hutton Orbital mug?#Thank you greatly. What's your jump range?#Can we have the algorithm?#Fuel rats to the rescue!#Do you mind sharing the build as well? Also there's [this add-on fuel tank size calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lgcodb6M64VLR5Qf9y2hfen5zoDsML8y1_gkhQP-n9A/edit?usp=sharing) floating around. In your view 8T addon would be more efficient for your route, though not necessarily in a general sense?#Hah, quite a few familiar names near the start of that route, both from my last A* route and recent planning run. Not surprising though I suppose - not many good options for getting out of the bubble fast!#Can you send a shiplink? coriolis.io or edsy.org? :D#Wow thats pretty impressive!I'm guessing this format is used for some kind of route planner which is also what allowed you to easily copy/paste? What program where you using for that?#/r/itwasagraveyardgraph#r/themonstermath#Did you also consider, that less-than-max-jumps need less fuel overall, so you don't need to refuel that often? I had good results with a secondary 32t tank and plotting in spansh with one lightyear less than max range.#Is the route exactly the same going backwards, or is it so specific with jumps and refuelling spots that going the same way back wouldn't work?^(*edit: removed other question, realized it was stupid.. lol it's too early -_-*)#Auto Hot Key for the rescue...Edit: to clarify, create an ahk-script which on keypress does:* read the systems from a textfile into the clipboard* open galmap* switch tab* press enter to put the cursor into the field with the systemname* paste systemname from clipboard* press enterYou only need to plot to the already selected star... Works well, if done correctly.#While making spiff proud and finding all the exploits?#83.53 Ly unladen#The algorithm is [A\* Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).  If you mean distributing the code, right now it's not in an easily distributable form.  I hand optimized it for my exact machine, making no attempt at portability or user friendliness.  (It was just a fun Saturday project, not a serious software development project.)#just call... :-)#At the start of the video I walk through all the outfitting screens, so you can see all the build details there.I don't know whether there's a general rule regarding optimality of fuel tank sizes.  It depends in part on pilot proficiency (e.g., how long it takes you to refuel vs. how long it takes you to supercharge properly).#I bound a button to a macro that copies+pastes the next destination from a text file.  (I didn't want to be hunting around for control-V while riding neutron jets!)#The one he wrote...#Yes, my algorithm takes that into account when searching for the optimal route.  However, it can't know how efficient you are at refueling or at supercharging, which affects whether trade-offs that increase jumps to achieve fewer refuels are worthwhile.  For my trip, I favored fewer jumps when the numbers were close.#> So is it possible with this to calculate the most ideal ship+outfitting(and thus fuel capacity + jump range) for the absolute shortest neutron route?Technically, yes. But introducing SO MANY new variables will exponentially increase the computing time. A lot.> Also, is the route exactly the same going backwards, or is it so specific with jumps and refuelling spots that going the same way back wouldn't work?I’m not OP, but I would assume the latter.#The route isn't the same backwards.  For example, when a neutron jump takes you to a non-neutron star, that hop can't be reversed.  Likewise, fuel consumption in the forward direction to reach any given star differs from consumption in the reverse direction to reach the same star, changing which jumps are possible next from that star.#That’s brilliant.  Now all I need is a better way to plot routes that accommodate my ship’s fuel range.#Great, thanks. I might be able to pull it off with my 82Ly Conda. I learned through experience that its true max jump range when neutron boosting is 350#Old open source guy here: if the code is interesting enough, someone will be willing to clean it up. And you are not judged on quality for something that was just slapped together for your own use.Do however put a giant""You are on your own"" disclaimer on it, so you don't have to deal with the whiners.Great job btw#That’s still easily distributable, just not easily compilable/runnable =pI would have said “just slap a huge disclaimer on it”, but I know people …#+1 for the source. You have a nice ""proof of concept"" that would greatly contribute to the list of wonderful external tools for E:D#Even so, I would love to see that code, if possible!#Ok cool thanks, saw it was very efficient and I've tried the neutron star planner website but having to copy/paste all the time and remembering which system it was was a annoying.#That was the part I was most intrigued by.  How you were selecting the next system so fast...#Well maybe the one he wrote was *just for plotting* not for helping him input the plot thats why I asked.Maybe I was missing something from ED Discovery or similar tools.#Good choice! I am doing the opposite, more jumps with shorter ranges. I guess over the long term, good and bad jumps average each other out. Well done on your journey, though! Congrats!#xD lol I just removed that first question. I realized jump range is the key element and only the Anaconda can get it this high, so other ships most likely wouldn't be even worth considering. And I guess since he outfitted an Anaconda for max range and tested multiple fuel tanks that was already the ideal ship+outfitting.#You will probably get stuck, the idea behind this is it calculates exact usage, if you are so much as slightly different from his ship build you will probably get stuck.#One of the things that makes me hesitant to publicize the code is that there are still things I don't understand about ED's fuel/weight equations that make me suspect there may be dangerous errors in my cost function.  For example, can anyone explain why in my video ED says my ship's current jump distance (78.86 Ly) is *less* than its min distance (79.01 Ly)?  How is ""min"" distance computed and what does it mean if it's not actually the minimum?#Enjoy auto-neutron:  [https://github.com/Numerlor/Auto-Neutron/releases](https://github.com/Numerlor/Auto-Neutron/releases)#Here's a program that does similar stuff:  [https://github.com/Numerlor/Auto-Neutron/releases](https://github.com/Numerlor/Auto-Neutron/releases)#For inputting you probably want something more like this:  [https://github.com/Numerlor/Auto-Neutron/releases](https://github.com/Numerlor/Auto-Neutron/releases)#I mean the question wasn’t dumb, and it is technically possible to do. Just not practical.#Do we need to head out?  -)#That's why it's called a beta. Plus, having it open source makes it easy  for everyone to correct calculations upon discoveries or game mechanic changes.Don't worry about flukes, gmail's beta lasted 5 years. There are better examples, who shall not be named :)#Perfect thanks!#This is going to change my life... huge time saver for VR users!#I'm pretty sure that's actually what he did.  Given that he said it only took 1 minute for his computer to calculate a route, it would take less than an hour to calculate it for all viable fuel tank sizes of Anaconda.#Nah, but thanks for your concern. As for OP, I know I might get stuck, but until I try I will never know#I wish I had more time to play the game. Would be fun do devise the most interesting and difficult fuel rescues possible. But not authentic need, so wouldn't do it anyway.#Oh yeah, I didn't think about that!  Numerlor deserves all the thanks though. :D#Unless you do the math.. but who In gods name would do the math. lol jk but that is very impressive to the OP! But I am like you and would personally rather risk getting stuck then try and crunch the numbers lol#I almost got stuck in the Xibalba region in a DBX with almost no injections.

These are two different pools for different purposes.If the second option is the case, selling pressure should be almost equal to buying pressureThis is very important concept to understand.&#x200B We could only analyze which option is true when Vol. 9 comes out covering Aug-Oct, which should be in December#Come on sunny press that damn button#[me, when my bos has 1 bad day and says ""you dont know what its like to lose money""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d44LyYL3GkY)#A lot of you sound like a bunch of pansies that have been crying about the buyback. It’s been weeks in this sub with the same crap. It’s been fucking annoying scrolling through the same whining comments day after day, sucking the life out of this sub. You’ve either been butthurt about why they’re not buying back, why they haven’t, when they’re buying back, and why they’re buying back. You’re crying and whining because you’re expectations are out of line from reality. You expect the buyback to pump your bags. And when you find out that that’s not the case, you’re even more butthurt.How about this for a reality check. No matter where they’re buying back from, or the reason, the foundation DID NOT HAVE TO BUY BACK ANYTHING. That’s right, they could’ve just let the free market run it course. They could’ve easily allowed the 3+ BILLION VET get dumped on the free market over the next 12 months. What do you think would’ve happened to the price then? Oh you don’t like where the foundation is buying from? Sell your stack of VET and get lost already. Just spare the rest of us your delusions and constant whining. FUCKKK#Rumor has it the VeChain boni just got dumped. But instead of VET dumping, because of the buyback, Bitcoin dumped. What a smart move!#Only 10 more days to the next OceanEx meetup.

But even then it would overrun the capacity of the hard drive for AWS at one point or another. I’m gonna have to find a work around.The only problem that I have for now with using things through connex, the recommended way, is that its forcing people to use a portal not everyone has. If its a chromium build (which I’ll look into) then it should be stable across multiple device platforms. Still though, if I build it the way I am setting it up, then pretty much any user from any portal whether it be Brave, chrome, safari and even later with React Native I could have mobile apps, is easily available for everyone.#Well, I dropped buyback rating from 4/5 to 1/5 on my price analysis list. I expect it to be fully completed, but since there is new unknown seller providing liquidity to the open market, that won't do much for the price.Back to the adoption, vtho burn and general market dynamics.#Further insight on why you should expect this to be a long, long journey on the way to mass adoption, with no need for baseless conspiracy theories and false accusations targeted at VeChain and its ecosystem partners.

""A lot of the \[blockchain\] pilots are stalling overall,"" Alex Pradhan, a senior principal research analyst at Gartner, said in an interview with Supply Chain Dive.   >  >Many early efforts in blockchain have not moved beyond the pilot phase because ""of technology immaturity, lack of standards, overly ambitious scope and a misunderstanding of how blockchain could, or should, actually help the supply chain.

Companies that want to invest may have to run multiple pilots and determine the right course of action through trial and error, Gartner said.   >  >There are also questions about how to properly manage a blockchain project. These issues can lead to users' experiences not matching the hype they might see surrounding the technology, and this ""will lead to disillusionment and buyer fatigue,"" Gartner said in a research note.  >  >Andrew Stevens, a senior research director with Gartner, told Supply Chain Dive there is a positive side to this fatigue. ""This is not withdrawing from blockchain,"" Stevens said. ""It's a reevaluation of its positioning.""  >  >Gartner found three main use cases for blockchain projects in the supply chain:1.

I'm severely underwater on VET (original x-node holder) but I'm a believer in the project long term. At a minimum, I believe with DCA'ing, I can come out on top. Best case scenario, VET becomes what I think a lot of people on this forum think it will become and we will reap the requisite rewards. I know a lot of you are feeling emotionally drained with this price action. If you can afford it, keep DCA'ing. If the project doesn't work out to our expectations (I don't believe this will be the case), it may be your best chance to recover your losses.#Yet another ""I now have enough for a node"" comment :)Just bought another 300K-ish, stuffed it on my ledger and, after a bit of a hassle and calling the ledger bad names (I think that helped!)

If every millionaire in the world wanted to own one, there wouldn't be enough to go around.#I'm actually quite shocked at the accusations being thrown around in here, so here's some information regarding what buybacks are for. Before anyone says it, I'm aware VeChain isn't a stock.Stock buybacks refer to the repurchasing of shares of stock by the company that issued them. A buyback occurs when the issuing company pays shareholders the market value per share and re-absorbs that portion of its ownership that was previously distributed among public and private investors. With stock buybacks, aka share buybacks, the company can purchase the stock on the open market or from its shareholders directly. In recent decades, share buybacks have overtaken dividends as a preferred way to return cash to shareholders. Though smaller companies may choose to exercise buybacks, blue-chip companies are much more likely to do so because of the cost involved.Reasons for Buybacks Since companies raise equity capital through the sale of common and preferred shares, it may seem counter-intuitive that a business might choose to give that money back. However, there are numerous reasons why it may be beneficial to a company to repurchase its shares, including ownership consolidation, undervaluation, and boosting its key financial ratios.Keywords here are ownership consolidation and undervaluation.#Wait they did the buyback but it came from a vechain wallet to binance and oceanex.

This mindset has cost me many thousands paper profits and massively increased my (paper) losses.#This is the moment to panic!#How can I convert or sell VTHO?#Ethereum requires the end-user to purchase gas. Vechain allows the app owner to cover the operation costs for their end-users.  Users having to purchase their own gas in order to be able to use apps is an insurmountable hurdle for the mainstream. It's already difficult to get ardent crypto nerds to take this effort, never mind some random normal person who may be interested in taking an app for a spin.   To me this is the biggest flaw in Ethereum. It perpetually keeps Ethereum and all its product stuck in a prototype phase.#Advantages:1. Fewer nodes and no proof of work means cheaper transactions. 2. Vechain allows you to use different clauses in the same transaction. That means you can reduce the cost of transactions by combining multiple transactions into one. 3. Vechain allows anybody to pay for anybody else’s transaction.4. Fewer nodes mean that we can upgrade faster. 5. Latency/throughout concerns are diminished because not anybody can be a node, and there are strict technical requirements for nodes. 6. Faster time between blocks because of diminished latency/throughout concerns and no proof of work. Disadvantages. 1. More centralized because not anybody can be a node: nodes are currently selected by the foundation. 2. Nodes will eventually have to become public. They could become targets. 3. Nodes might be subject to strict AML (anti money laundering) laws. You can’t do this in bitcoin or ethereum because we don’t know the identity of miners. 4. Might be a security.5. We don’t know who the nodes are yet.#Vechain is laser focused on building tools for enterprise usage . Most people forget that blockchain technology has to somehow be integrated into legacy systems#Look up Ben Yorke. He has fantastic podcasts and articles about vet#There are many technical reasons as others have said, but one big reason is that you can go into business with vechain.By that, I mean you as a company can sign a contract with vechain and sit down and negotiate and do all that stuff businesses do. And vechain is working with you to find a solution for your needs. And they have dnvgl working with them on blockchain services.I don't know ethereum as well as you do, but I don't think you can go into business with eth, and sign a contract and do all those things businesses do.Businesses need to do these things to feel secure in what they are doing. I think that's why eth is losing alot of businesses to vechain.#I'm a long time lurker of ethfinance (ethtrader before), and here.  I'm extremly bullish on ETH and VET.  From my view, they are not competitor, ETH is going to be decentralised finance, and VET to supply chain, more specialized for enterprises and products.  They both have very strong fundamentals, and they can live together with no problems, in my opinion.  About VET, you should check partnerships with DNVGL for exemple, it's crazy to see them officialy doing marketing about VeChain, and seeing the price crashing over and over. I'm not kidding, you can see some high people of DNVGL promotting VeChain on their own twitter.    The best I can tell you, is to check DNVGL, PwC, and some others. It's just mind blowing to see a so small marketcap for VeChain, in my opinion !#Yes indeed :-(#Inverted alt season. 🤪#[removed]#Heeeyyy...the Hero of the Day spitting nothing but the truth!

If you're not planning buying during the downturn and then selling as we're coming up you're doing it wrong.Sunny already talked about how he isn't planning on the short term, his outlook on vechain is over the next 5 years so we shouldn't be thinking any sooner than that.  Vechain isn't concerned about a bear market, they're not concerned about price. They've done SO much more since this bear market started. With zero mainnet activity they hit 2.5billion MC on speculation. At this MC and all the work they've put in especially with them buying 25mil worth of coins at these prices, you should be using your birthday card money to buy as much as you can.Hell just the fact that they HAVE 25mil to buy their own coins should be a tell.

Good luck everyone i wish you all the best.#I don't think it's baseless FUD. vx7777 showed that a huge amount of VET was moved to Binance with a foundation related account recently. And now they buy back token without any effect on price. That's a joke and a punch in the face for investors. Vechain announced: ""*The Foundation introduced the buyback strategy as part of our broader efforts to further support community building...""* That's simply not true if they buy back token from themselves, from their employees or from whoever. The only effect of the buyback was that poor bagholders kept holding because they expected Vechain to buy 2% of all circulating supply on the open market until end of september which clearly did not happen.#Dnvgl will introduce their wallet to 900k customers 1000 clients in the pipeline for trying out Vechain technology No worries#Does kinda depend on what timeframe you're looking though.

You would have to purchase one on the market (currently for about 500,000 VET). So basically you need at least 600,000 VET in your wallet address PLUS an X-node (paid for separately). However, if you have 1,000,000 VET or more, you can upgrade to a Strength node! :)#OH MY GOD! WE'RE HAVING A FIRE!!! SALE... OH THE BURNING! IT BURNS ME! EVACUATE ALL THE SCHOOLCHILDREN! AHHHHH!

I can wait for however long it takes because I don't intend to sell at a loss, but at this point it seems like it'll never happen.#Next year and the year after are when increasingly large portions of VeChain’s income comes from customer revenue, so yeah, I fully agree. I’m waiting for that true value to come. If another bubble comes along in the meanwhile I’ll take it. But VeChain themselves predict 2021 as their major growth phase with 65% of funding coming from revenue (around 35% in 2020). I don’t expect anything any sooner than when the project has income because one can’t rely on speculation.#[removed]#Hundreds of millions of VET have gone from Ocean Ex Custodial Account -> Binance recently.

You just have one single node through the entire process. However this could be wrong. The Economic nodes are not worth much on the market currently. If you want it to just go away fast transfer some VET to a secondary wallet. As soon as the node wallet drops below 1million the strength node should be destroyed. If I were you I would look at buying an X node. If you are upgrading from one economic node to the next level, you could also just switch over to the X nodes.  A Vthor X node can be bought for 600,000 VET and then you can upgrade it to all the other X nodes levels (Strength X with 1.6 million holding, ect.) for free as long as you have the required amount in holding. It is the general thought that X nodes will be much more valuable in the future than the economic ones.#You upgrade it via the mobile wallet.

And it's in operation right now.  https://bbs.vechainworld.io/topic/164/vip-191-designated-gas-payer#This process is called ‘multi-party payment system’ - more details here: https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/introducing-the-vechain-multi-party-payment-protocol-525daf1bee7The concept is Tx fee delegation. The aim is to enable adoption of blockchain technology by essentially keeping the end user experience the same ie: not require them to learn about crypto, store it safely etc, to be able to take advantage of its potential offerings and benefits. For example, with the carbon ecosystem, a user scans a QR code from their electric BYD car to upload data relating to their carbon emissions from their journey, which are converted to carbon credits (via a process certified by DNVGL). The driver doesn’t knowingly use any VTHO in this process, but they do and the transaction is recorded to mainnet. This system is live and functional, fyi. BYD just released a manual to drivers about it. Around 200k cars are eligible to make use of this. Very likely only a tiny % of them might understand current state of public blockchain technology and how to manipulate/store assets safely.#Yes, I know cometverse.com did this. Not sure if they still cover the gas costs but they used to. They had events with lootboxes dropping nft's and all you did was sign and broadcast and it was paid for by them. Could find the contract if you are interested.Found one for you, a test I did with their mobile beta a few months ago. https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0xfc28423e757d0b64e3014ff5113ffc6d1c12f40d/transactions look at the transactions and click on one of the id's. Down there you can read details and see what address paid the gas for me opening lootboxes and getting nft's. As you can see this account never had any vet/vtho put still performed transactions because of mpp and the dapp paying for me. All I did was make a wallet (comet - chrjome extension)  and nothing else. Imagine this on any game/app/dapp and you get a picture of the possibilities. F.ex could the app expect me go pay with cash in app or similar and then use that to fund gas payment or similar. Extremely important feature if mass scale adoption is to ever happen. Hope this was understandable.I know coins built on vechain use this feature, decentbet f.ex. Say I want to bet 100 dbet on myself winning a hearthstone game, i broadcast the bet and they cover gas cost through mpp so all I need is Dbet coins to bet with.Edit: made a fresh comet user to try and show you what I meant and make a gif out of it (they have stopped covering the gas cost. But try to imagine this being accepted as it used to and you probably get what I mean: https://gfycat.com/decisivetimelyankole ).Edit9 lol: I recommend WoW and /or SC2 depending on how much time you have available.

Where's your source?#But still on the same level as OP. It's just tiresome reading all this entitlement.#Correct. Once you have 1M VET in your wallet, you can hit the Upgrade button then a countdown will begin. It takes 10 days for the node to activate but there is a countdown on the Rewards page (bottom of the screen in mobile) in the wallet. Some people sell their Strength Node token but there are really only 2 reasons someone would buy one. 1) They don't know that they're only buying out the waiting period. 2) They're too impatient to wait 10 days and believe that the additional VTHO they'll generate in those 10 days will offset the cost of the node token (pro-tip....it won't).#Correct.#Oh wow, I've never seen that ""Node Manager"" tab ever until today. To be fair, its been a while...This is awesome! Cheers#Congratulations on the node status! It is nice that this is now possible on the ledger nonetheless.

No spare cash :(#[removed]#Speculation plays its role, but you can’t wait around for speculation as it never is guaranteed. It’s dependent on variables outside your control. What you can control though is income. And if you’re earning money and there’s demand for the tokens, that’s beneficial for everyone and price. When there’s success, then there will be speculation on future potential and then that rocket gets antsy. But until a project starts to see true success (and people start recognising it en masse) this whole market feels like it will remain as a ship out to sea with holes in its sails without wind. It’s kind of directionless at the moment.#From  [https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-kicks-off-the-first-phase-of-the-25-million-equivalent-of-vet-buyback-plan-8d8e47c22799](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-kicks-off-the-first-phase-of-the-25-million-equivalent-of-vet-buyback-plan-8d8e47c22799) "" The first phase of the buyback, which amounts to no less than $5 million on the open market, will be implemented over the next quarter, starting in July 2019. ""It doesn't feel like it was on the open market if they arranged the selling to happen for buying back VET from their employees?#Buy back is on going. If you Google you can find the buyback address and see how many VET are in it thus far. Last time I checked it was just over 400 million tokens.#Nope, just in the mobile wallet.#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Vechain) if you have any questions or concerns.*#You said **"" If one has one type of economic node and wishes to upgrade to the next tier""** The lowest tier economic node is Strength at 1 Million.  So I read this as you have a Strength node and are looking to upgrade to the next level which is a Thunder (5 Million). If that was the case you had enough for the X Node option as well. That is why I mentioned it. Additionally: If you have say 2 Million that is enough for two strength nodes but you would have to split it into two different accounts. 1 million in each. You cannot have two nodes in one account. Also there is no additional VTHO generation benefit to this. Just run 1 node with 2 million in the account. Anyway I made the assumption you have a pretty large bag and were looking to upgrade to a Thunder node. Regardless, You do not need to publicly discuss your holdings online as it will make you a target for hackers.#When you go to the rewards section of the wallet, the various node tiers and ‘upgrade’ functionality should be visible along the bottom. You can scroll along to see the various ENs but for obvious reasons, the upgrade button is not present without the requisite VET.#Haha, I wish I was a Scot so I could escape this political looney-bin. I’d just go chill in the Hebrides. Looks stunning.#Ah ok.. but I would argue that a regular x node is more valuable since you can always upgrade to a higher tier node, but you cannot downgrade. That means that there is more demand on regular xnodes than the higher nodes, since very few people have enough VET for them.#During the dump yesterday VET stayed around 40 sats.

It doesn't make sense that, while they are selling huge amounts of VET per month (to keep the lights on, do R&D, salaries, etc) on the open market, they are also conducting at the same time a ""buyback"" of $25m USD. And now we're seeing that they are magically purchasing this VET from some custodial account we have 0 info about and besides a few spikes on Binance we have seen no proof at all that this buyback is real. I'm thinking more and more this was just a marketing ploy to try to keep us retail investors happy that they think about us. But the more time it passes, the more I feel we're just cash cows to them to be dumped VET at. Happy to be proven otherwise. Oh and, where exactly does that $25m USD come from to buy the VET on the first place? Because we have also 0 info about that and neither about that mythical $500m ecosystem fund we've heard nothing more about it since it was announced. Sorry to be so negative but it all seems BS.#[deleted]#Same boat. This is epic times. Hopefully we can all meet someday and laugh and reminisce at this#It does matter. If I invest 10k, ride it up to 250k and then back down to 5k in a year, I'm not allowed to bitch about how I ""lost"" 245k. /u/nyclix is down 75k but is that from ath or or is that how much fiat he put in and burned.I can sit here and bitch about losing 300k but Id be lying to myself and others. I only invested roughly 15k Fiat over the course of the last 3 years. That which I never sold, I never had.#Pointing out that the mainnet activity is shit isn't entitlement#It is fud until you prove it. When someone sells funds and Vechain buys it, that's not wash trading, even if the sell and buy order are coordinated at the same time.It's ok to be disappointed without going full paranoia#""which amounts to no less than $5 million on the open market"" I assumed this was their valuation of equivalent VET on the open market, not specifically stating they are buying from the open market.#Who said anything about employees?# [https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0xCBb08415335623A838E27d22Ac7FDF8A370AF064](https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0xCBb08415335623A838E27d22Ac7FDF8A370AF064)#Yes, understood.  Definitely agree on discussing holdings. I was mostly making a comment on the value of an X node given it's cost.#Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks friend.#If you have enough for a strength or thunder x node why would you just buy an x node and not a thunder? Especially considering the thunder is going for cheaper than the regular x node? Unless you're just trying to flip the node#The sat value doesn't go down with BTC dump. It goes down with BTC pump/recovery afterwards. Watch...#So your argument is that this buyback is what is keeping the price down?In what world does buying hundreds of millions of vet keep the price down?Wow.#I see what you mean, apologies I misunderstood your initial post, I thought you meant did he invest $5,000 in apple shares, withdraw that at $75,000 then loose $65,000 in bitcoin, and was saying that doesn’t count cose he “started” with $5,000. Where it appears you was talking about there current portfolio simply rising then falling without them withdrawing any or making any trades.#Remind me of the useful insight their post provided rather than whine about it.This is early stage tech. Don't know what anyone was really expecting...#Pointing out that it is low in comparison to previous weeks is one thing.  Adding emotional snarl words such as 'pathetic' and 'shit' is childish and smacks of an unwarranted entitlement. There has been no promise of x number of transactions to continue consistently from time y, so any expectation here is the result of your own speculation. Converting that speculation into expectation and then damning the main net for not delivering the targets that you invented is pretty damn entitled.#That would be some tricky wording, but your reading is sound. Besides, even ""if"" this is an employee pool,1. The employees deserve a payday after working for 2 years towards locked bonuses.2. The buyback is up to $25 million, so if we hypothetically assume this is an employee pool, there is still plenty of money to go around after that.Besides, what /u/vx7777 has been asserting, as far as I can tell, is that this is possibly an OceanEx custodial wallet, not just a Foundation wallet. I imagine there are plenty of whales with access to this service.#No problemo! Always happy to help :)#Because then your funds would be locked. If you go under that node treshold then the node is destroyed. Unless you sell it ofcourse, but then there are less buyers since you upgraded it.#I think the term used upon the Walmart announcement was exponential growth. What we're seeing is the opposite.    I'd argue that people who have seen their investment being obliterated over a 2 year period are justifiably annoyed that the mainnet is running at the same level as 6 months ago.    The fact that people are rolling out the 'entitled' buzzword continues to make VeChain sound like it has cult followers#That's true I guess but it's likely a 2 or 3 year hold from here and id rather generate 3-4x as much vtho and stack more vet. Prices are also very low, x node and strength x node holders are not far off from the necessary vet. If you wanted to unlock it and just sell it for cheap I'm sure you'd have no problem selling it#>I think the term used upon the Walmart announcement was exponential growth.You have a source for the foundation using that term? My google-fu can only turn up dodgy crypto sites and people posting here using that language in relation to the Walmart announcement. However, if you do, and if it implies that we can expect continuous growth with no ups and downs, then I'm happy to revise my opinion. I'm pretty sure no such statements exist though.If that is the case, then what you're doing is projecting hopes and expectations and then getting angry at others for not living up to what you have projected onto them.  That *is* entitlement. It is the expectation that the world around you should conform to the contents of your head, rather than the other way round.As to cult-like thinking, I have loads of issues that I would like to see addressed, from the AN identities on down.  These are issues that speak to things where the foundation have actually fallen short of what they said.  But I'm not going to beat them for not living up to something they have never committed to.#> You have a source for the foundation using that term? I'm pretty certain I remember some tweets from either VeChain staff or DNVGL staff using that phrase. To be fair, I may be mis-remembering.   >what you're doing is projecting hopes and expectations and then getting angry at others for not living up to what you have projected onto them. That is entitlement.      That's some serious pseudo-psychology. You may as well replace the word 'disappointment' with 'entitlement' if you're going to look at it like that.#> That's some serious pseudo-psychology. You may as well replace the word 'disappointment' with 'entitlement' if you're going to look at it like that. When you're saying something is 'shit' and 'pathetic' because it hasn't achieved goals that you imposed upon it, that's not disappointment. It's treating your own imposed goals as if they are what really matters.  There's a word for that ...#So the mainnet operating at 15% of what it was 3 months ago isn't shit?#I don't think you understand where we are in the cycle for this business.  Most of the stuff on the main net at the moment are trials, small numbers of goods with systems being assessed.  We're still two years from seeing the main net working at proper 'going good' levels.  If you look in the white paper, you can see some rough annual income breakdowns and use those to guide your expectations. At the moment, even the one-off days of a million transactions due to migration are trivial in the long run.  Getting upset about ups and downs within that insignificant range is genuinely pointless.  And while I realise that this is crypto, arbitrarily pegging everything against one-off all time highs is just silly.  So no. How many transactions the main net is doing compared to a couple of days a few months ago doesn't concern me too much.  It seems clear to me that the project is going in the right direction.  The kick-off for consistent transactions on the main net was much slower than I would have liked but now the main net is alive I certainly don't think micro-scale variations at the training-wheels stage are anything to worry about.#Fair enough. It concerns me somewhat. Hopefully we're all winners in the end#Aye.  Fingers crossed. In terms of timelines, the graphic at the bottom of p. 99 of the white paper is very useful.[https://cdn.vechain.com/vechainthor\_development\_plan\_and\_whitepaper\_en\_v1.0.pdf](https://cdn.vechain.com/vechainthor_development_plan_and_whitepaper_en_v1.0.pdf)You can see there the projected percentages of their budget covered by operating income vs non-operating income each year.  That gives a very good idea of what the foundation themselves are expecting in terms of real activity and when they expect it to start.#I'll have a gander, thanks"

I got my calendar notification this morning and live streamed the talk - in which Sven Edgren (DNVGL, Head of Digital Transformation) was speaking.Two main topics were covered - MyStory and the Carbon Ecosystem. I have been here since the Daily threads started - so am fairly up to date with most VeChain related news. However, a few things stood out to me:1. In passing, Sven says that DNV GL, PwC and BMW are Authority Node holders. An educated guess would have told you this anyway, IMO. Although it was nice to hear.2. MyStory is working with a Global #3 apparel manufacturer on sustainability products - H&M possibly? Pilot or live - I don't know  [https://imgur.com/a/HrzxiiI](https://imgur.com/a/HrzxiiI) 3.

I may also have missed some things.All publicly available stuff. This is the second public DNV GL talk that I have live streamed - the first was with Brett Gray (DNV GL) where I was able to ask questions at the end.

However, today we see almost no gain on VET, it's been fairly stable for the whole day while others continue to recover. It's kinda safe to assume there was no buyback happening yesterday/today.If we assume they won't be buying during the weekends, there's only 8 working days left to obtain $3,500,000 of VET. This amounts to more than 100,000,000 VET bought per day.Basic trading rule states that the best strategy to accumulate would be to DCA in regular intervals. It's literally what most of us have been doing for the past 18 months. Whoever is in charge of buying back wouldn't be that stupid to try to time the markets.I don't know what would feel worse, to learn they were buying every day but we still ended up being the biggest losers most of the time, or that they might not fulfill their promise. Anyways, 8 days left. Let's see what happens.#Let me play devil's advocate here a minute..DNV GL - a digital assurance company that is partnered with vechain helping to authenticate products on the blockchain. I thought the entire purpose of the blockchain was for it to be the trust machine - to not have to have third parties enter the equation. I understand how the blockchain is an immutable ledger but the way vechain (and in particular ""my story"") is handling this is still using a third party DNV GL that the end consumer has to trust.#>More photos from @sunshinelu24's (#VeChain CEO) ""Enabler for Mass Adoption"" Keynote from @WXblockchain.>. #Blockchain #WXblockchain #wxsummit #China $VET $VTHOhttps://twitter.com/bsc44_x/status/1173940473179734016?s=20#Rising price falling volume again,running out of sellers#Im getting the feeling that 2021 and beyond are going to be years of sheer joy for whoever got into vechain early on in 2017 / early 2018, even at somewhat unfavorable price points. I can't envision a scenario where, even in the most pessimistic of cases, VechainThor doesn't grow at least 50% yearly if the governance and economic models succeed in attracting real-world adoption. What an incredible feeling it is to be able to experience this as it happens... Day by day.#What a great day for vet#Rank 32 on CMC now. Let's go to top 10 atleast.

Say for instance a person had accumulated enough VET to split it in half  and have two accounts with an economic node. For instance 1million in one account, 1 million in another. You could now have two strength nodes. According to Vechain Stats the VTHO generation would be the same as having one account with 2 million VET and one strength node. So the extra node will not generate more VTHO but could it be worth something to sell one day? Disclaimer: I do not even have enough VET for even one node much less two. I am just curious of the advantages to either of these scenarios.#BNB will be listed on Binance US since launch  [https://twitter.com/cz\_binance/status/1174252381632114689](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1174252381632114689)  , which again proves my theory:**a coin isn't a ""security"" if there is enough money paid to play.** BNB does token burns and it doesn't matter.

Auditing is a necessity and blockchain won't take that away, all that blockchain does is make the entire process more efficient. Blockchain just makes it easier to identify bad actors on the supply chain.No enterprise level blockchain can be truly ""trustless"" without 3rd party audits and oversight. I would avoid blockchain projects that don't take the same approach as VeChain.#The ledger is immutable, yes, however, at some point you need a means to certify that the information written to the ledger is accurate and trusted.  &#x200B Having a 3rd party global entity with a 150 year track record whose entire business is founded on trust and integrity certification is about the best possible solution for ensuring the data in is authentic.#They are the answer to the GIGO problem that people say blockchain does not solve on its' own.

There is no fee for this operation and no interaction with any tokens.  Reading info from the chain is always free to do, writing information to the chain is what requires vtho.#That's the beauty of vechain and what makes it unique.The end user doesn't need to at any point buy vet or use it.A third party will pay for the transaction because it brings value to them, while still bringing a different value to the end user.In the carbon credit program, one scenario is perhaps the insurance company will pay the vtho because now they have your driving habits info, which would be very valuable to them. The end user just drives his electric car and then cashes in the credits he earns, knowing nothing about vechain. There are many other businesses willing to pay the vtho because of the data they'll get back. Walmart will pay the vtho to upload info about their products because in theory it will increase their sales and reduce their costs. The shopper just buys stuff they know is authentic and safe. Scan the product and put it in the basket.#That's a great username you have. Bravo#Yesterdays move is a lot like general altcoin market mini reversal and not a buyback yet. Waiting...#A look at total crypto market value only shows a 5 billion increase over the past week (260-265). This mini alt rally is fantastic, but BTC will demand tribute again from alts in order to break upwards out of this wedge. From there I believe BTC dominance will rise to ~80% as it steadily moves to and past 20,000, which is critical. Alts will move up in USD but down on the ratio, though at a slower clip. Alts will have a field day after that, with BTC continuing to 40k as alt ratios dramatically improve. These are my thoughts for the crypto market moving forward.Vet will do well once crypto is making fresh inroads into old financial markets, and the companies behind NDAs will be revealed intentionally to capitalize on that upwards momentum.#Could you explain to me why BTC “demands tribute” from alts in order to rise?#Oceanex#I've bought it there before many times, and will certainly use Kucoin again.

This is making things easier for people.#People can't handle the truth most of the time haha [https://i.imgur.com/OJNyqA8.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/OJNyqA8.jpg)#Absolutely right, I always get excited at the thought of the surprised naysayers whenever some great news surfaces 😆😆#I've seen crazier things#Using the blockchain and being a part of it are completely different things. In the first one you are looking for what is best for your business, in the second one you are actively supporting it. Are you in college? It is not obvious, and you dont know what youre talking about, just guessing.#Not sure this is proof they're an AN.#Exactly, I do not think many VETerans understand that the Foundation most likely offers big companies AN status for free initially.#Where did you get this stuff youre using#Other projects do have clauses, it is not unique to Vechain.I would rather have higher transactions at this stage of the project. More transactions would suggest a wider diversity in adoption, rather than a small number of customers batching large number of clauses.#Even token transfer can be bundeled in clauses. Have seen Binance outgoing transactions which sents out different amounts of VET to different adresses, all in one transaction.A transaction is just a bundle of clauses, where clauses are transactions in themselves (IMO)#As above. To me, more transactions suggests more adoption by more customers with more use cases. Clauses then follows as implementation by that partner is ramped up.Edit: A single chicken farmer could cuold batch 100k clauses in to one transaction. That, to me, is less appealing than 100 different customers each batching a thousand clauses.#Yes, I keep about .5 btc that I trade. Anything over that I move into the VET wallet. It's actually the only exchange I use now.#Yes#It would only be for the US. The rest of the can but VeChain on Binance. If they really want to spend money to make VET accessable to the US market, make sure it’s Coinbase instead of Binance.#Dude go play your path of exile, there are serious things discussed here#This isn't ""proof"". This is something you can use your logic to come to some conclusions. The same as there is no official solid proof that AN that recently quit was TicTalk AN, but there is enough facts to come to this conclusion.I'm not saying there was rock-solid proof for that fact, but anyone who did enough research will not be surprised if it will be officially confirmed.#You are correct. Clauses are just a more efficient way to bundle transactions, they’re still transactions but by a different name. You can either send three Tx of 100K VET one at a time, or bundle all three in one transaction. The outcome is the same. It’s more efficient, cheap and simple this way which is good for business.#I think Coinbase won't list Vet ever. They would list Doge before Vet. So Binance US is the answer.#Bothering to browse the person's post history, then trying to shame them for playing a damn game of all things.Grow up man.#Definetely a kid.#I guess most early  vechain partners will be Ans ( dnvgl, pwc, byd etc )#Why not?

""definetely"" wasn't a question related to the discussed topic. I decided to look who I'm talking with.  Waste of time.#>Definetely Definitely#For sure.

It's not like you can actually hide any assets especially for a company like DNV GL and PWC but also in general.Unless they got all the VET for free, they must have done some cash transfers which need to land somewhere in their books and will be spotted during any audit.#Another waste of time.

Who knows.# 7 Asian Blockchain Leaders On Interoperability, Regulation, And Innovation #### Driving mass adoption in China*Before mass commercialization of blockchain can occur, current technologies and product offerings must reach a level of maturation, which reduces friction for onboarding new users. Reducing friction for end-users is a prerequisite.**Developers and companies should make it simple for the less technologically savvy portions of the population to purchase cryptocurrencies and use decentralized applications. Further, tokens need to be integrated into current traditional platforms to replace current offerings.**Kevin Fang, founder of VeChain, is integrating the company’s blockchain technology into the existing technology of the company’s enterprise partners. As a service, VeChain outsources provider solutions that are customized for specific industry-based pain points.**For example, VeChain offers traceability to Walmart China’s supply chain for food safety. To hammer home the point of interoperability, Fang said, “enterprise partners don’t care which chain they’ll use, or if it’s a public or private chain, they just care that a traceability solution will work.”* [https://cryptobriefing.com/7-asian-blockchain-interoperability/](https://cryptobriefing.com/7-asian-blockchain-interoperability/)#**Today's Fun Fact**There are now more than 20,000 VET addresses with more than 100,000 VET each.#2600 eco nodes live!(2500 was on 23 Aug)#“Digital wallets for 900,000 customers by 2020 with @Deloitte”  -Sunny Lu I think we’re missing the @Deloitte part.

It was announced when VET was over 60 sats and BTC was around 11k at the time. What is worth $1.3M now in the buyback wallet couldve been bought for up to $1.8M for all we know, so there would be $3.2m left instead of $3.7M.#If suddenly hundreds of millions of VET are transferred to the wallet while we were among the biggest bleeders I will call bullshit on the origin of those VET.#Low probability. They moved funds within two hours previously. I don’t see reason to keep funds on exchange, not worth it.#That would be my strategy.#Because they missed multiple deadlines in the past. But still always delivered later.#They said that **No less than 5$ million** would be bought in the first quarter, starting from July 2019. So if they state that, you can expect that to be a hard deadline#That would be fucking strange because it would be in conflict with the purpose of the buyback.#Awesome, thanks. But my post is correct as well then right? I can store extra liquid in another address too?#The Vechain Black Lotus#I don’t see there ever being less than 1000, given that you can sell them.

Guess this implies confidence?#Fair point actually.#If you split your stack into two wallets you can do both. Generate vtho on your node in the big wallet, cycle generating a new node and selling it in the smaller wallet.#Probably because a lot of people have only heard about selling econ nodes as a scam, where someone brainless thinks they are paying for the whole node rather than just the status.  Given that anyone can get their econ node status for free, there is no reason to pay an inflated price, so my guess is that people aren't realising that OP is basically selling at a price that is a reasonable balance for the Thor lost/time saved when waiting to upgrade.tl dr they think he's a scammer.#Unsure.#[removed]#https://medium.com/altcoin-magazine/how-to-tell-if-cryptocurrencies-are-securities-using-the-howey-test-da18cffc0791I understand the rest of the world is not classifying assets like ETH, XRP, BNB and VET as securities. My concern lies with point 3 of the howey test and how US regulators may apply it to VET specifically due to the buyback, as well as BNB due to the token burn.Thats why I think BNB isn't being listed on Binance US at launch, although I could obviously be way off base here.Edit: just to clarify, in a sane world this is a non-issue. The US is not a sane place currently.#Any \*really worthy\* project can now get funding from 500m$ VechainThorPowerFund. No need fo ICOs.

forhonor;d5k1e8;1568740529.0;/r/forhonor/comments/d5k1e8/ubi_you_have_a_testing_ground_available_why_not/;Ubi, you have a testing ground available, why not use it to examine the effect of color swatches with the community?;Just a suggestion: open up a temporary testing ground for the “color mixup” issue. Set each player’s hero as their selected neutral colors, and host dominion games within this testing ground period. Then, use your **BIG DATA** and community outreach to examine the amount of times teammates have been killed, or confused for an opponent. This might give your community some good insight into what you may be concerned about, *or* show you how this may represent a non-issue for your players. Also, from a financial standpoint, think about how many people might be more inclined to purchase steel for outfits if they can use that coloration in *any* match...;"&#x200B > Also, from a financial standpoint, think about how many people might be more inclined to purchase steel for outfits if they can use that coloration in *any* match... Pssst, Ubisoft, read this!!!!#And lets call it Testing Grounds Phase Two: Civil War because of all the team killing that will definitively happen /s.#I thought about this quite literally a few moments ago. It would be great if they used testing grounds for things other than just reworks#Golden idea dude!#Excellent idea#And also revert the colors to their original state#What can be changed within a character's moveset within a different game mode doesn't mean that a full on customization option can also be changed for 1 game mode. Color swatches are not private information. They are public customization option that can't be changed within a game mode. However, a moveset can easily be changed since during the foundation of the game, the Devs made the movesets dynamic to allow balance changes. However color swatches are related your account and cant be changed with a new mode.#You can't put color swatches into testing grounds since you customize your character before entering that mode, but I'd prefer UBI added all swatches for both defenders and attackers in main game for a limited period of time to see the community reaction. But they cant/wont do that, because if they decided to go back to seperated swatches afterwards, people who bought swatches in this limited period of time whould be displeased since most of people would buy swatches for team modes anyways. It seems there are two options. Make all swatches for all game modes for good or make skins on client side, which seems a bad idea and way too different from current customization system to try and implement it.# Testing Grounds is like a event within the game, and seperate session, not a completely different client. You need a different client like they did for Marching Fire.#You wanna know what else would make them more money making everything more expensive UBI isn’t solely about the money#I am asking because I do not know or understand how Ubi codes their backend or manages their server relationship with individual player host communication, but: do you not think assigning a player’s individually selected *NEUTRAL* color wouldn’t work? They already do this in 1v1 game modes.This is why I specifically said, in the OP: “set each player as their specifically selected neutral color”#I am asking because I do not know or understand how Ubi codes their backend or manages their server relationship with individual player host communication, but: do you not think assigning a player’s individually selected *NEUTRAL* color wouldn’t work?

I work in IT, so I know it’s never just a matter of “flipping a switch” for anything, but I couldn’t imagine it would be incredibly different from the setting of neutral colors for duels. It would essentially just be A team-based game mode with neutral colors.#You've no idea how market works, do you?#Oh my god this guy figured it out, to make more money, just make your products more expensive.I’m going to be opening a lemonade stand and charge $30 per cup. That’s 10x more than what normal lemonade stands charge, so I’ll make 10x more money!!!Thank you, I really appreciate you enlightening me on the easy way to get rich.#The only solution I personally see is to change the neutral color pallets all in all. They can't be changed for a specific mode, but they can be changed entirely. However, making changes to color pallets and only having these changes be in a game mode wont happen due to the foundation coding of the color swatches.#Currently you play your ""normal"" heroes in TG. You can't make a custom character usable only there. So heroes customisation is a whole different block or module within the game. I think your proposition, though very logical and highly demanded, isn't obtainable because of the amount of work it needs.#Oh enlighten me#Never said that much my guy#The amount of profit isn't proportional to price of sold commodity. The more expensive something is, the less people will buy it. If ubi drove up the price of steel, less people would buy it, so they'd actually earn less money. Companies try to set the price at a ""just right"" level, which gives them the biggest profit possible.#> You wanna know what else would make them more money making everything more expensive#Oh but you quite literally did#Yeah duh#I love it when people say something stupid then try and act like they didnt. Like, we all heard/saw it. Just accept that you were wrong.#I said more expensive not 10xs#Oh, pardon me, I see the mistake.

They make no comment about what isn’t locked up outside of the executive team in previous financial reports.

At least „staff dumping their tokens“ is a non-fud this way.#Can't even imagine what the employees might feel like, they've probably worked their asses off for the last 2 years, collecting a fixed amount of VET as bonuses to now cash out when it's 96% down.

Now that they’re fully vested, they can sell at the market prices and the buyback provides liquidity so it doesn’t tank the price even more. Doubt they were originally thinking of the buy back when creating VET bonus program to emulate RSU’s, but since the price has been dumping, they need to backstop it for the inevitable sell off.#[removed]#Yup. Artificially supporting the token price is not a sign of confidence. Plus it fails the most basic securities test.#It is not, it makes perfect sense as otherwise the price just continues to keep tanking (employee selloff). The real problem we obviously have is that we do not have enough investors interested in Vechain. On 1 side you have massive BTC whales moving the entire market ( look at all alts) and on the other side you have employees that need to provide for their families. I'm just fascinated that we do not have much more retail investors. I invested in LINK to which at certain point just kept skyrocketing but not VET.

And anyway, they should be getting paid in fiat, bonuses 'n all....this is a piece of nonsense and draws too much negative attention to the token. I'll be glad when it's done.#This is spiralling out of control. There is literally no evidence the buyback has anything to do with employee bonus VET. It’s more likely, as stated, the investment is for VTHO and to create VET’s store of value status (by creating collateral). The daily and the past few weeks have been like watching Chinese whispers unfold. At first it was ‘where buyback, VeChain is scamming’, now it’s ‘OK, they will buy back but it must be employee bonuses’ and now ‘poor team having to sell their VET to fund VET buyback’. And soon, it will be something else. We should just let things unfold, collect facts, then have a discussion. Everyone is speculating like crazy with zero facts and all that leads to is conspiracies. VeChain are under the close watchful eye of PwC, Deloitte, DNVGL etc.. they’re not going to be forcing their employees to sell their VET. That’s not ethical nor legal. Plz.. Let’s just let the buyback happen. It’s coming.#Definitely no.

The announcement and large increase in burn came around the same time#As I explained in my price post, market forces are the main price driver anyway. Buyback is just a nice addition.

They are not interested in supporting the price, they are investing in their own product from a $500M ecosystem fund - for both VTHO services and to create VET’s ‘store of value’ status for the ecosystem. IMO, they’re creating a large pool of collateral with this VET. VET was always intended to be the smart currency of the ecosystem, therefore it needs value backing it.

The average crypto investor really is naive and simply wants to put in a couple dollars look away and believe that itll end well. We need to rid of that hopium and simply look at facts.

Looking forward to hopefully reading more details about it in the quarterly financial report.#Yeah I don't see the need for the token either but they still got more going for than the other coins that just got listed.#Coinbase also has zcash and dash ? I guess they aren’t really banning them :)#Can't be sure about that.#Ayyyyyy#>Blind hopium will wreck so many ""investors"" in this space I just dont get why people dont learn to take it all a bit more seriously.That's why crypto flies 5000% up and 95% down. If all people will make serious decisions it will just turn... into stock market.#I don’t disagree with you at all. But if you think the wild speculation you initially commented on when you bashed ‘hopium’ has credence, then you undermine everything you just said, because that also has absolutely zero factual basis for analysis. (Not Vx7777’s comment but what he’s referring to)#It is an IF statement#Yea, get your point.#Well fine, I never said directly about cream advisory/incubation, it was just a proverb) For me the writing is on the wall.>I was just adding as you said “got creamed twice” I assumed you were implying this was also a CREAM projectOh, no. It was an allegory initially.#I always thought that Walmart stopped for a while because they are going to implement vechain tech to a larger scale :)#They had to produce money (tokens) from nowhere to actually be able to pay people anything. No one would use the system otherwise.#Hmm maybe the rumours aren't true after all, to be honest I haven't looked into it in depth.#Dash is legally the same as Bitcoin. It does not have similar privacy features as zcash or Monero. It uses coinjoin just like you can use in Bitcoin.#it is now..  Nice edit.#Didn't edit that, just mixed they/their/you/your.

As we know there are 101 ANs and there was a ""contest"" to become one back in 2017.But checking the blockchain we can see that , for example, this AN[https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x9c3b425ae9909abb6ff0621d1f7dd2fbe57f73af/transactions](https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x9c3b425ae9909abb6ff0621d1f7dd2fbe57f73af/transactions)Got enough VET 25M  just 2 months agoAnd started signing blocks just 11 days ago[https://explore.veforge.com/blocks?page=65&signer=0xa2591d83336ed2ff1cdbb0717b462c0149c36614](https://explore.veforge.com/blocks?page=65&signer=0xa2591d83336ed2ff1cdbb0717b462c0149c36614)&#x200B So we can see new players are coming into the game.#And one more thing. Sorry guise for taking over the daily.I'll be keeping eye on this wallet who sold the vet[https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x9902dcb39b92ca11b0b1445be0447c5bf7c6a28e](https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x9902dcb39b92ca11b0b1445be0447c5bf7c6a28e)Watching what he does with other tokens like OCE, TIC, EHrT. If he sells them, I'll see that as just capitulation and moving out to cash.But if that entity just sold the VET and Auth Node, I'll strongly believe he was \*forced\* to. Selling whole VET stack (right here, right now, before buyback)...ok, could be. Willingly giving up AN... I'm not buying into that. Smth is going on there.#OK so u/vx7777 excellent investigative work with the recent (super) dumping is thought provoking to say the least. This project has taken a beating price wise despite the fundamentals steadily improving which has prompted theories that range from possible to simply outlandish. Certainly those still here and holding are either going to be validated so greatly we will look like geniuses or this was a poor investment (crypto wise)in what looks like an up and coming successful company.So with that said, maybe we can breakdown the negative and positive possibilities of the recent 100M+ dumping (and removal of an AN):**NEGATIVE**- Simple capitulation. Evidence: looking at the fucking price action.- Insiders gaining knowledge about critical flaw or issue in project. Evidence: Nothing specific in the public other than perhaps the *relative* lack of good news/Medium articles from the project itself(which may be deliberate based on Jason Rockwood's recent tweets). Other evidence for this?- Insiders gaining knowledge about an external threat to the project such as laws or regulations, perhaps within China. Evidence: incredibly slow development of crypto related regulations worldwide, China's absolute silence on the topic since banning exchanges in 2013, lack of listing on Coinbase (regulations/compliance in the US).- AN entity (Enterprise? Single person? In between?) converted to another blockchain project. Evidence: none that I can produce other than not being able to specifically eliminate this as a possibility.**POSITIVE**- Removal of a bad actor. Evidence: basically all of u/vx7777's investigative work. Instant liquidation of AN. Sunny's odd tweet of gnome taking a dump (did I just type that?)?- New strategic partner being introduced and added as AN. Evidence: this would rely on the fact that the AN dumped was owned by Vechain and a new one will or already has come on line. Again defer to vx7777's work here.- Price suppression by smart money or bad actor or both (not necessarily positive in the immediate but in the long term it means whales know there's value to be had in controlling the price/accumulating). Evidence: Sell wall after sell wall after sell wall after sell wall after sell after...you get the point. Relative to the rest of the market and project's demonstrated fundamentals, price should not be doing worse than other alts, in a vacuum at least.One other large consideration related to all of this that everyone is talking about is the buy back. 2ish weeks left in the month with another ~$3 million to buy. Vechain has to know their credibility to the retail market is on the line with this one given the announcement, details and public wallet address provided to the community. Possibilities:- Buyback has been ongoing but not yet transferred to the wallet. Seemingly contradicted by the fact that brief spikes in the price on the exchanges have been linked to VET transfers to the wallet.- Buyback will spend the remainder of the money in the next 2 weeks. Vechain has been on the up and up for the most part with the retail community so this would be a significant boost (or hit) to their credibility.- Buyback will not spend the $5 million outlined for this quarter. This would be the first significant demerit I assign directly to the project. I would not sell but future buys would be halted with a wait and see approach.Thoughts?#Hey guys. I wanted to structurize my own knowledge about current state of the vechain price and influencing factors.I'll be analyzing those real reasons, not just giving sucked out of thumb predictions ""should be 1$ by Sept""  ).As you should already know, not news and pahtnaships are moving the price, but buyers and sellers do, as I said numerous times here (and a lot of peeps are constantly being butthurt by that fact). What is really influencing the buying and selling power? So, let's go.Positive and negative factor at the same time.General altcoin market sentiment 5/5 is of the \*utmost importance\*. Negative short-term, positive long-term.Vechain would have tripled or quadrupled in price on Walmart news in Dec2017/Jan2018, but in summer is retraced almost immediately after the news and went even lower. People were crying WHYYY, but there is nothing surprizing here. Market waves are more important than anything. Remember the AMZN and 100$=>6$=>2000$. A rising tide lifts all boats. But when everything is sinking, you're sinking with everyone else, nobody cares about ""good news"".There is nothing certain in the market, but there is ultra high probability that altcoin market will bottom somewhere between here and BTC halving date. Even more probability to bottom between now and summer 2020 (after BTC halving), I'd give it 98% chance. Yes this is the accumulation range for the next rally. The bigger accumulation base will be built, the more sustainable the rally will be. For sure it won't be easy on your patience.&#x200B Positive factors:Buyback 4/5. Real money. This is simple. Every dollar poured into buy&hold (and not speculate to sell higher) has big impact on the price. We just have to wait and see if the buyback goes as planned. The only downside to this factor is that it is short-lived.Binance US potential listing 3/5. Not all americans will register back on Binance US, so the total userbase will definitely take a hit. Also we don't know when Vechain is going to be listed. But overall less listed coins = more money for each coin. And Vet has very good chance (please don't cry about ""security"" here, thanks. This is pay to play game)OceanEx fiat gateway 2/5. This is long-long-term positive factor, but for now OcenEx doesn't have large userbase, so the impact won't bee too big for a time. For sure this is easier way for people to buy in and is scheduled to launch in Q4. Soon.Bakkt potential listing 2/5. I'm giving this low rate because this is too uncertain factor. Bakkt is launching with BTC only for now, but as we know, they were researching into listing additional coins and even had a list that included vechain (and Verge lol, so they didn't made too in-depth research there. We can safely assume they will reassess the list). But if Vechain gets listed someday, it will be quite big. I think it \*could\* happen in 2020-2021.Increasing transactions by Walmart or any other projects 2/5. This is good for sure, but too speculative for now. We have to wait and see.&#x200B Negative:\-Salty bagholders 5/5 Well, this is main source of sell pressure. Lots of people jumped on coins in 2017 by pure gamble and moonboish narratives (100$ VEN soon). Capitulation is not a single point in time. This is a process. People bail out in waves. You can always check vechainstats to see the amount of people bailing out in the given moment of time. Judging by periodical whining there are still some left.\-Binance US closure 4/5 This one is hard hit. US traders were at least 20% of Binance volume, maybe 30%+. Not all US holders bailed out, some just transferred to their wallets to hold, but many did. Good thing: this is almost entirely priced in already. As you can see)\-Lack of transactions 3/5. Yes Vechain is ahead of most of crypto projects by a mile. But this isn't enough for economic model to start working properly. Potentially fundamentals are big (partnerships, projects), but currently this isn't enough. We need stable 1 million TX a day for eco model to properly kick in. Die-hard fundamentalists would rage that I hadn't given this 5/5 rating. Sorry guys, general market waves are way more important still.\-Vechain ICOs sell pressure 3/5. I'll be brutally honest here. I don't think those projects are bringing a lot of value (won't call any names, but I mean.. most of them), but every time you're giving them money, they will sell the collected Vet on market, putting quite a bunch of sell pressure. I think any really worthy projects could pretend on VechanThorPower Fund to fund their activities. Yeah... there are more serious VCs sitting there, so you can't just suck money out of them on pure hype, they will screen you thorouglhy, not like retailers. Sorry guise if you were hurt by that truth.\-Shady actors 2/5. Like the one who sold 100m Vet yesterday. Those are not pleasant, but they will be gone with time. Cream said he'll investigate on that matter)Vechain employees 2/5. Yeah they get Vet as part of their salary and it isn't voluntarily locked as the executive teams Vet. Can't do anything about that, just a fact.&#x200B Conclusion and a dose of hopium: I must say, that's not a real bull market until previous ATH gets beaten. AMZN beaten its ATH in 8 years, BTC is taking 3 years on average. Fact. Inhale.&#x200B I'll update the post if I remember anything else.#[https://twitter.com/sunshinelu24/status/1172962696796528640](https://twitter.com/sunshinelu24/status/1172962696796528640)Sunny said his word"" I don’t know who it is.

My old phone (including my VeChainThor app) was deleted.  I just setup my new app/wallet with my mnemonic phrases, etc.  It says the setup was successful, but I don’t see any of my assets.  Everything is zeroed out.  Will it take a minute to update or am I SOL?ThanksUPDATE- I got it.  I remembered I wrote down a separate mnemonic phrase and it worked!  Thanks everyone.#How many people think that they’ll sell in 5 years when  Vechain has made it? Let’s say it reaches 25 cents. Most of us would be in good profit. Would you sell and move on? Amazon in 2010 when it finally established itself after 15 years of grinding, was about.. $100. People that bought in 2001 at $10 thought “wow. I’ve 10x my investment, time for me to sell”. They did good, really good, Ironically, that would have been the time to HODL because that’s when major hedge funds look at a money generating business, that’s a leader in the field, and buy for the long term. They look for sustained growth, and dividends. Forward 10  years and Amazon hit a whopping $2000!!! If Vechain reaches that threshold. Where it’s a tech and market leader by being the most used Blockchain, I would encourage everyone to hold on to your VET for dear life. Because that’s where the fun begins. And as broke as some of us are because we’ve been investing non stop for the past 2 years, now and it seems like the near future is the time to buy. This is indeed blood. If you believe in Vechain, buy! Cheers and good luck!#[deleted]#At this point, the only thing I believe is worth doing is holding vet and vtho. I don’t see any financial incentive to convert vtho back to vet at this point.#Guys don't worry about the buyback! We know they aren't amateurs and have plenty of funds available. It's an excellent strategy to wait until the end to do most of the buyback when the price keeps declining. They're aware of the price suppression, they're aware that people are worried. I presume the main goal of the buyback is to get as much VET off the market as possible. The best way to do this is to buy the majority at the lowest price before the end of the quarter. When do you think that is that when the price keep dropping? It also doesn't make sense to believe that they've already purchased the VET but just haven't send it to the VeForge address. Why bother buying VET when you're not going to send it to the wallet for a while and you know the price will drop? It all looks like this was the strategy from the beginning in case the price keeps dropping. To accumulate a small amount of vet every couple of weeks to let people know they're keeping their promise. And buy the majority at the end when the price is lowest. There's no reason to believe they're not gonna come through with their promise. I believe buying the majority of the vet in a very short time frame will definitely push the price up. Which will keep old investors confident hodling and attract new investors.#VET/BTC seems to have very little volume on OceanEX. I've been waiting much longer than expected for my order to fill.#Here's an article that sheds some light on what Sunny means when he says ""let's not speculate, let's continue to build without being distracted"" (paraphrasing here, obviously).[https://media.consensys.net/gartner-blockchain-will-deliver-3-1-trillion-dollars-in-value-by-2030-d32b79c4c560](https://media.consensys.net/gartner-blockchain-will-deliver-3-1-trillion-dollars-in-value-by-2030-d32b79c4c560)The next couple of years are going to be very boring for those who spend their time looking at charts, worrying about the price, and coming up with all sorts of conspiracy theories that fit their worldviews. But they will be very exciting for anyone who can get passed the desire for instant gratification, and instead maturely embrace the patience and serenity that it takes to glide through this long journey.  Edit: Lol at the salty, overinvested downvoters.#What if VeChain found collusion / bad actors in the AN’s and has expelled them so they’re dumping?That would actually be a positive as it would validate the Authority Node model and help Enterprises feel more secure about the project.#[removed]#Woke:The later the next bull run, the better. Still accumulating here. You guys should all be happy about this opportunity to DCA. I know it‘s worrying sometimes but I‘m actually laughing at these prices right now. I would have never thought to be able to double my stack one day.Not so woke:Muh losing sats, I‘m down 90%. My life is shit. No more Oreos in the cupboard. Trump still president. One day I will die.#I've said it before, I dont give a *#!!/!  about the price right now. Its unbelievably pathetic yes how VET is where it is but I was just thinking the other day  some big name companies have seen value in what Vechain is doing. They have seen such potential that they are actually using the tech. We know the names. In my mind Vechain is still easily in the top 5 projects that have the greatest chance to see success in blockchain, and as Walmart scale up their use, and the other various projects begin to come online, that chance of success is only becoming more obvious.#What do you guys think about the decreasing mainnet activity? The trend doesn't look too good imo. This week we burnt significantly less VTHO than the week before. I understand that the spike with 1 million daily clauses was data migration. But why is the activity constantly decreasing every week since then? Shouldn't we see increasing mainnet activity at this point? I mean groundwork is done, services are developed and can be used. Is it clients leaving or not using the blockchain as much as before? Maybe some companies tested Vechain and decided not to use it anymore?#The vaichain coin is in deep trouble and it's an issue that has to be addressed.#Hey Everyone. /biz/ contrarian here. Don't take this as FUD / Salt but seriously, do you despise money? Let me run the general bagholder consensus on this sub:Meh VET is a long term play. Don't expect any action pricewise in the next 2-3 years.Meh Adoption Adoption Adoption Adoption Adoption but don't expect any price change till we get network usage that justifes the VET/VTHOR demand price.Retail bag holders account for less than 10% of the wallets.Just Tether up if you're too deluded to think any other project can suceed.You're guaranteed to lose sats for the next 36 months at least. Wake the fuck up. You've bought too early.#Vechain made it clear in 2017 they wanted to hold onto some of their ANs for future partners to be able to fill the roles. It’s great to see that plan in action.#here take silver for all your digging. seems not all heroes wear capes.#Any post that is not a cry is very welcome.#Keep digging Sherlock! Love reading your input...#Thank you for your research! This is really helpful.#Keep us updated. I appreciate your findings.#Interesting.......Fishyy 4 sure...But interesting..#[deleted]#Couldn’t it just be as simple as the foundation initially holding the AN but is now giving the place over to an enterprise to run it?#Buyback is the biggest deal breaker here. If it will be postponed or not finished in time, it will be the biggest kick in the balls since ages.If it gets done, I suppose it will get us out the downtrend.#Pretty great analysis.#There’s also a correlation to the binance US situation and price of alts that rely heavily on binance.#The AN is switching addresses apparently, this is what I was told by cream and he was told by Kevin feng#I fail to see why the buyback is deal breaker for many. Because you want your bags pumped? And you’ll capitulate if they change the timeline, or push things back? Things change in the business landscape. They promised something but due to changes in business environment, they won’t. As long as they give a fair explanation, I don’t see what the issue is. But if you want to capitulate, by all means. And unless something is really wrong with Vechain fundamentally, I’m buying the fckin dip at 20 sats.Edit: Great investigative work and a very nice write up. Thank you both for your time and efforts.#Thank you very much for your continuous constrocive contributions. It's highly appreciated.#Always happy to read your posts and contributions. Keep it up. 👍#Can‘t really disagree on anything. If you believe in the ecosystem and trx will ramp up big in the next few years, it‘s a strong buy. If you think there‘s a good chance VeChain will fail, you sell. But honestly: current price is 20x lower with much more amazing news by now.Only thing that bothers me is the average quality of ecosystem projects (ecoysystem partners are great though) and the fact we don‘t see many new projects being built on VeChain. For some reason, that makes me worry more than seeing TRX growth „kind of stuck“ right now (but this is just impatience anyway).#Yeah okay, but should be 1$ by sept.#1. Binance will launch a U.S exchange (https://www.binance.us/). Isn't that worth mentioning?2. For me another unknown and potential risk is the concerns around stable price for blockchain users (clients - see Walmart, BMW, etc). And how the foundation will respond to this need.Will it be via lowered VTHO needed to pay for tx? Increased generation rate? Etc, these questions are unanswered to how they will affect clients and their views of VeChain.But for that we have to wait until the VTHO burned meets or surpasses the daily generation rate.#A bit strange that Sunny claims he doesn't know who the AN is. Isn't the whole point of the AN's that their identity is known by the foundation?#[deleted]#Hold my hand brother...and we shall see daylight once again...

All citizens will participate in this ecosystem. There are 35,000 people in this small country. Every citizen has their own wallet.

If they act to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, save energy or save water, they can get rewards. This reward will be placed in the smart contract and will be verified by us, and the citizen will be able to enter the early ecosystem to get established.

This is a very good opportunity for us to try out how this technology can create value for us in a small country.

Their have their own agenda. I don’t expect to see vet there ever. Feel free to be unhappy.Binance US is the answer. Even Bakkt is better chance. I guess they will be exploring new assets in 2020.#WHY IS EVERYONE DISCUSSING DEADLINES AND SPECULATE ABOUT POTENTIALLY NOT MEETING DEADLINES BEFORE THE DEADLINE? Christ! That buyback discussion is totally annoying and currently it‘s just FUD. Until maybe after the deadline but first things first.I mean: just fucking sell and stop whining here. We had one of the best infos for months yesterday with Deloitte and DNV GL and yet everyone is discussing buyback rubbish.#You guys had me thinking that we were at the end of September, whining about the buyback and such. You can see who actually has an interest in the project, vs those who just want to make some quick gains. The former would be talking about the amazing news yesterday, the latter would be complaining that their bags have not been pumped.#The buyback initiative is nothing more than a message to investors: Hey guys, we are so confident that we are willing to buy our own coins. So don't worry, we are still working hard and have every incentive to continue to do so, even in an extended crypto ""winter"". That's it. Even Tron did this lol. It is completely inconsequential and does not merit any anxiety or doubt in VeChain at all. The foundation has met all its goals thus far and they continue to listen intently to the community, as they have from day 1. They will keep their promise just as they have before. They probably already bought the coins but will transfer them later to the public account.I cannot believe people are losing their shit over this. Go do something meaningful with your time, guys.#Ok Ill just copy one of my comments here, since I see a lot of debate about the buyback, and expect it to heat up more as the deadline approaches. Just to be clear - this is not whining. I take things for facts as they come. Buyback deadline not met? Fine, Ill take it as a fact and make a decision moving forward. No biggie. But since I feel many are missing the point, I wanted to say this - One of the features of blockchain is trust. Vechain is building a public blockchain. Therefore one of the core values of what they are building and offering revolves around trust. If you cannot trust what they say, its hard to trust anything that they attach their name to either. Yes this example is a bit extreme, and not meeting one deadline doesnt automatically invalidate everything you do, but still, trust is key.Simply put, I dont want to guess whether or not what you say is true, based on the fact that in the past sometimes it was and sometimes it wasnt. I dont have time for guessing games. Businesses dont either. I want to believe that everything you say is true, based on the fact that in the past it always was. The moment I lose that certainty that I can trust you, and I have to guess and waste time and effort thinking about whether youre telling the truth or not, Id rather just not deal with you.#The clock is ticking, Mr. Lu.Tick tock.#[deleted]#[removed]#Ok. So whatchu gon' do if buyback is incomplete?Ask fo' refund?#[removed]#Is it not possible that the foundation is buying back the majority of coins OTC through the 1.5B fund that was just unlocked?And perhaps they decided to buy enough on binance to keep the price from crashing but not more. Thoughts?#Quick question off topic.I'm a new investor to VET and just signed up here. I where wondering if one also receive VTHO airdrops on Binance for holding VET? If so, on which dates?#[deleted]#All the people going “Wen buyback” make me laugh.I didn’t invest in VEN/VET based on a buyback promise. I did it based on the fundamentals, which are stronger than ever. If the buyback quota is not met, big deal. Sell and leave.

Absolutely no duty of care towards their users.#Wauw.. i never even heard of these coins. What stops them from listing 'real use-cased coins' as VET..#blimey ,thats a pile of shitcoins#When Coinbase only had BTC, ETH and LTC it made sense since those were the big three players. Even considering adding these rando coins over many other working blockchain projects is just disappointing and makes me think that perhaps Coinbase is up to something nefarious.#My bet is that since it's a Chinese made coin us exchanges will not look to add vet. It's been my only worry really#Let’s ask them?#Am I the only one who thinks VET nearly off-limits to US investors and definitely not on Coinbase could actually be a good thing? We’re amidst a USA-China trade war. It could be a matter of time before the US/Trump realize China has a disproportionate vested interest in BTC/mining (and maybe he already does that’s why he has slammed BTC in the past) and who knows, maybe the administration endorses Ripple to slam the Chinese BTC holdings if he can get everyone to FOMO in from BTC to XRP or some other direct BTC competitor.CONVERSELY, ATM with how VET is trading on off-limit US exchanges, this would only strengthen VET to be endorsed by the Chinese gvt. as a relatively very small amount of US citizens would have much holdings to benefit on Chinese endorsement as it’s not listed on major American exchanges.Just something I think about, personally. Crypto is rarely talked about in trade implications#I guess people just want to hear confirmation from vechain reps that everything is on track. If Sunny would made an appearance in telegram and wrote one phrase “No worries, everything is going according to plan” every hassle would stop immediately. Uncertainty is killer.#The deadline means they have to buy an absurd amount in a short time. 750 m in the next 10 days to keep their word.It's seemingly more likely to not happen than happen, so now the question is what does that mean for investors?They forgot? They were unable to buy? They didn't want to buy?It means something what that answer is#Pretty wild. Am thankful can simply read and know that VeChain delivers. Will be fun to see what VeForge and VeChainStats look like with more of those valuable transactions#I was flooded with work.... what was this Amazing News I missed yesterday?#Im baffled by the obsession with this buyback initiative. As though it makes any difference in the long term.#Me whining about the buyback has nothing to do with me wanting the foundation to 'pump' the price. I am just worried about the buyback not going through and with that, them not keeping their promise. Don't act like you are just here for the amazing news and technology and do not give the slightest shit about the price. Everyone wants to make a buck, you as well#[deleted]#>They probably already bought the coins but will transfer them later to the public account.Yeah all 25 million $, now they will just transfer them over to buyback wallet for the whole year.Guys, please. With that ""already bought"". Every single buy is crystal clear like a virgins tear.#The only people losing their shit are those defending the potential of Vechain breaking a promise they didn't need to make in the first place.No one raising concerns is losing their shit. They are discussing possibilities and implications. Chill out, quit trying to police the discussion. If you can't handle people not circle jerking vechain for a day or two, take a break from the dailies.#I agree with you man, why In the world would anyone bump at these prices cuz they left a few million on the table in the buyback? It’s not like they’re saying “hey guys we partnered with amazon” and it doesn’t come to fruition.#I don't know where all of this stress is coming from. They have 11 days left to prove themselves. Maybe it's their strategy? Even if they spend the complete 3.5m on Sept. 30, I don't care. VeChain/Sunny will most likely hold their promise.#I was wondering why you deleted this comment.This is the sentiment that anyone with enterprise tech or corporate culture experience is feeling right now. Vechain may look like the best crypto project, but that bar is way way lower than the expectations of international conglomerates, and they don't care that you don't care if vechain misses a published deadline like this. They will take their trust platforms to people they feel they can trust.#I don’t think Mr. Lu is reading reddit. But he regularly reads his twitter  )#The clock always ticks#As long as it doesn't do an ICO. Nice.#lol#I'm not interested either. Thanks, will take a look.#Dump on us again? You sure that you read what for this buyback actually is?#There’s a reason for everything. If it doesn’t happen, I would expect them to communicate this to the community in the same manner they originally announced the buy back. The foundation have yet to give me any reason to worry about anything. I fully expect that will continue.#I think initially we'd need to tweetstorm the whole known VET team for an answer, and if the answer isn't ""sorry, we forgot to move them to the wallet"", then it's a pretty safe assumption they are facing liquidity issues, and could be at risk as a business.#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

Stops FUD and worries quick - and takes literally ten seconds to complete so no excuses.#But everything IS going according to plan. :-) I mean, let’s have a look at business (not price) development). Some people in this sub behave like greedy shareholders. The only reason people want the foundation to buy back is because they expect the price to raise accordingly. I call them out for that. We don‘t need short term speculators and people who will always pick something negative to talk about. Bear market is exhausting but I‘m willing to take another short term 50% drop if that rubbish ends.#DNV GL wallet to be released to 900,000 clients in 2020.#Disagree....I think this only matters in the long term.  A short term pump or dump based on a buyback matters little. But a lack of trust to investors moving forward is a big deal.#I'm starting to think that a lot of the whining is coming from non-community members just looking to cause drama. People obviously have their own opinions, but there's no way in hell this many people just started caring about this today, after arguably the biggest news of the quarter dropping just yesterday. Seems too random.#I can totally understand that, some people are just worried about VeChain breaking their promise. The thing is though, these guys have never broken a promise before, so why would they break their first promise on something so easily fulfillable? if Sept 30th comes around and still nothing, I'll be there complaining with you. 11 days beforehand though, I think it's a little overreactive in my opinion.#""Every single buy is crystal clear like a virgins tear."" This is based on your imagination / confirmation bias, which is something that many others apparently in this sub suffer from. Let it go.#We're not losing our shit  we come here for fruitful technical / business discussions and updates, not constant whining. Get a grip, already.#Im reacting to debate on this sub since some people are already coming up with excuses on why it would be ok. Im just saying it wouldnt be ok. But since thats still in the future, it was not something that I was initiating discussion about.#Rapidak and i will also not care if they do it on September 30th.We're talking about hypotheticals, not starting facts. A lot of hopium addicts here don't seem to get that vechain is still in early days and they have a lot to prove.#Then someone should tweet him.Because each day that passes, it becomes more improbable they don't fulfill the buyback promise.The implications of that... I don't exactly know. Many will shrug it off, many will jump on it as a chance to attack their credibility and such.Either way price will definitely suffer.#[removed]#Liquidity issues.

Are you totally out of your mind?#While i understand that from an investor perspective it may be important they do this exactly on time, i don't think it is that important#I'll re-post the excerpt I grabbed from the medium article.> VET buyback plan worth **up to** $25 million. The **first phase of the buyback, which amounts to no less than $5 million on the open market, will be implemented over the next quarter**, starting in July 2019.https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-kicks-off-the-first-phase-of-the-25-million-equivalent-of-vet-buyback-plan-8d8e47c22799#I just don’t understand why they’d set themselves up for failure. To be honest - i’d be shocked if they fulfilled it.There is simply not enough volume on binance. The price would double, only to be instantly sold down by bots/traders.#This is correct beginning (5th or so) of each month.#They distribute it to holders once per month based on their VET holdings over the month. You can’t trade it. If you hold it there, you might not realise you have any until you filter by assets of low value. It doesn’t register a price on Binance.#Even tho he said business stakeholders? I guess i just see token holders, more so, stakeholders of the network, rather the the business. I Could be seeing it wrong#Their customers place their trust on things more important than a buyback. If you lose your trust in the entire project because of this, please by all means, sell and don’t look back.#Because they didn't have to do a buyback, and they didn't have to tell anyone they were performing a buyback, and they didn't have to provide anyone with a schedule and plan for how much they would spend. However, they have done those things, and they are a new business selling trust. If they can't get this right, why should people trust them?No one is saying anything for sure yet because they haven't failed to meet their commitment yet, but if they do fail that is a big deal, no matter how deep you and others want to stick your head in the sand and ignore it.#Agreed, but only with an explanation why not.  IMO that's the minimum after having announced it.#Thanks!#Yeah but the private ico is the problem here. These VC will dump their cheap coins on us retail investors. Pretty unhappy with coinbase...#>The only reason people want the foundation to buy back is because they expect the price to raise accordingly. No, we want the foundation to do the buy back because they promised to do the buyback.  Not following through on promises is a quick way to lose trust.#Whoa! Wait...... 900k clients as in 900k DNV GL partnered industry users?#“900,000 “active” users” 😉#The buyback initiative is nothing more than a message to investors: Hey guys, we are so confident that we are willing to buy our own coins. So don't worry, we are still working hard and have every incentive to continue to do so, even in an extended crypto ""winter"". That's it. Even Tron did this lol. It is completely inconsequential and does not merit any anxiety or doubt in VeChain at all. The foundation has met all its goals thus far and they continue to listen intently to the community, as they have from day 1. They will keep their promise just as they have before. They probably already bought the coins but will transfer them later to the public account.I cannot believe people are losing their shit over this. Go do something meaningful with your time, guys.#I'm certainly here most days, /u/rapidak is a Mjolnir X node holder, /u/vx7777 posts constantly. Also, is your reading comprehension so bad you can't understand the difference between whining and raising potential concerns?#Actually, it's been going on for weeks. But it gets worse as we near the end of this month. It's ridiculous that people would spend so much time on such a futile subject. Who the fuck cares if the foundation buys back some coins  they just released 2.5 billion VET to fund ongoing operations just 2 weeks ago!!#Personally I've been operating under the ""if it's not in the buyback wallet, it hasn't been bought back"", mindset. I'd be very surprised if they had bought this quarters' worth in full already, but it's certainly a possibility.#""They  probably  already bought"" is based on your imagination, sorry for reality check.I'm emotionally neutral to this discussion, I just want to point to wrong facts that are trying to be used.#I had same feelings as you with all the price whining, i came to realise the only thing you can do is skip over the stupid whine posts and respond more to the good posts, I've made a conscious effort to upvote and engage with the good discussion posts and just totally ignore the whine.#I think they are already buying. I think that on the last day of the month, approx 3.5m usd of vet will flow to the buyback wallet.#> Because each day that passes, it becomes more improbable they don't fulfill the buyback promise.You mean the opposite.#You really think many people will sell out if they don’t meet it? I’m just not so sure of the very small % who even know about it (reddit users etc) that many would even care, it’s gotta be way less than 0.1% off all holders surely.#Are you? There is no good reason for them to say they will spend x amount of money in y time, something they fully control, in a business built on trust, and not do it unless they are willfully lying or they don't have the money.#Their entire value proposition is ""trust us"". If they can't keep simple promises that they made, and DIDN'T HAVE TO MAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE, then why should people trust them?#[removed]#I'm going to be very interested in the why?Why didn't they fulfil the announced buyback? What could have stopped them? At this point in time it would below my mind if they bought $3.5 ish million in the next 10 days.I don't think that's realistic but we'll see.#There are more exchanges than binance. And the volume  increases the more is bought... There is plenty of VET available on the order books.#Stakeholders like others have mentioned is a commonly used word in business lingo. In this medium article I’d say stakeholders refers to the either the people working at the various businesses. Or the various businesses clients. The ‘holder’ part has nothing to do with actually something, like VET here. That I’m sure of :)Just someone with a vetted interest really.#It’s mind boggling that people can’t grasp this thought#You’re not a shareholder in VeChain.They owe you nothing and I would much rather, they keep their commitments to their paying customers than satisfy moonbois.If you are actually interested in the project, there is plenty happening right now that should make you excited. I don’t even think of the buyback most days unless I come in here and see people whining about it.#Well before you lose trust in VeChain, just wait 2 weeks. That whole discussion is kind of pointless right now.#Yes. We don't know shit yet, not everyone will use it, but the news is definitely worth more attention.See [here](https://twitter.com/sunshinelu24/status/1174133396303482885/photo/1) , and check the other tweets while you're at it.#“We will provide digitally certified wallets to 900,000 customers. We will provide this service at the end of January 2020. We will continue to cooperate with Weigel and Deloitte. of. Yesterday, Mr. Lu said that there are 470,000 active users in the Bitcoin community. By January 2021, we will have 900,000 active users to use this digital wallet”#You're not exactly who I was referring too, and i'm certainly aware of vx7, he's not even complaining about the buyback though. He uses logic and reason it seems, not emotion.#Ah, I must have not noticed it the past few weeks. I don't check in here daily though, so that wouldn't surprise me. Personally I don't think that they are going to break their first promise on something so easy to do. We know they have the money, and we know they would (hopefully) never purposefully destroy their perfect track record unless they were exit scamming (which lets be honest, that's pretty much out of the question at this point, what with DNV GL and multiple countries involved)#Anything is possible, that's the point. It's possible that they've already bought them back and stored them in a different address. It's possible that they're keeping them stored in Binance and OceanEx (cue the geniuses who will claim that this is crypto heresy). It's possible that on September 30 they will buyback all the remaining amount. Who knows? What blows my mind is that some here CONTINUE to react, almost every day, like the sky is falling? Are you people THAT bored? Go start a side business, or grab a beer with some friends.#It's based on a reasonably analysis of the situation  much like the rest of the real world, many in this sub also lack proper critical thinking skills  they would rather create a scenario in their heads and try to fit everything else into it.#That's what I do usually, but you can only ignore them so much. As soon as they are left alone, they become emboldened! And from there it's just an unchecked whine fest with several of the same accounts repeating the same shit on a daily basis. It's annoying as hell.#As appealing as it might sound for the masses, this is perfect example of wishful thinking.This lack of understanding how market buys affect the price-volume is worrisome.#If that happens I call bullshit.Shenanigans.Every buyback so far has been observable. There were spikes in volume and price. There was also a transfer within hours if not immediately. There has been none since last purchase and there simply hasn't been the volume to support this kind of purchases. Many days vet did less than 20btc total volume.It's simply not possible they purchased nearly 750 m vet and left it on the exchanges without any traders noticing such large purchases.#If they don't do the buyback, they straight up lied and their promise is worth nothing. So I would seriously reconsider this#>Are you? There is no good reason for them to say they will spend x amount of money in y time, something they fully control, in a business built on trust, and not do it unless they are willfully lying or they don't have the money.You cannot think of reasons, so there can be no reasons. That is a very common mistake ppl make. This is an issue of imagination, or rather a lack of imagination.#They said ""Up To"" not ""Exactly""This small detail is being vastly overlooked in this sub and its hilarious. Sell your bags already if this bothers you.#Because there exists a world inbetween the black and white.

But I am starting to question their strategy, if their plan is do the big buy in the last week before the deadline.The closer it gets to the deadline, the harder it's going to be for them to buy 3.5million dollars worth of VET without doubling the cost of the coins.#You're Awesome!  Thank you.#[deleted]#>Every buyback so far has been observable. There were spikes in volume and price. There was also a transfer within hours if not immediately.Correct on all points. People who are pushing the agenda ""they are silently buying now and it is invisible"" are just injecting hopium into their vein or just never looked in the trading books. If buyback happens, it will be OBVIOUS. Like every single time previously.#There has been a regular spike in volume over the past couple of days, seen a lot of buying pressure coming out. So wouldnt call it bullshit, but that is just my take#Enough of the damn drama.

This isn't some speculative or exploratory effort with unknown bounds that need to be explored. This isn't waiting for another company to announce something or an NDA to expire. They make financial plans that span several months to several years in real businesses. If they had a plan to spend x amount of money, and communicated it out to people, they had better do it. If things come up, they have months to communicate that and amend the schedule. Saying sorry after the fact isn't how a business builds trust.And yes, at work, if I miss deadlines and don't communicate in advance that there will be a delay, i lost trust with my boss and peers. That's how life works...#Maybe their whole strategy is to make the whale manipulator believe they won‘t just buy everything at once because this would basically x3 or x4 the price. But IF they do it regardless. Price will be up and whale would have to buy back at a much higher price. Just kidding here but it would be very funny to watch#And then the price shooting right back down as bots fill in the order book.#Im not presenting any evidence. Nobody has such evidence right now except for the foundation itself. Im merely arguing that the assumption that the buyback would be as visible as some people believe it to be is simplistic and flawed. Vechain never claimed that they would send the purchased VET to the designated address immediately after buying it. Like Ive argued before, this could be tantamount to market manipulation if investors start to pick up on the accumulation pattern and, for example, implement trading bots to take advantage. Im not stating my opinion as a fact. Im more bothered by how obsessed some are with this when it is quite inconsequential in the grander scheme of things.#We're gonna need a separate mega thread for the implications of them not fulfilling this buyback.#The past couple days was simply bots reacting to the whole market. Not sure if you noticed, but every alt went up. All of them all at the same time. The vast majority of trading amongst all coins is done by bots.#Less than half. A quarter is plenty of time to spend the money, why wait until the very end of the quarter? If they fail to complete the buyback, this will be a massive trust problem.#And you said a business could predict months ahead that they were going to miss a deadline but if they could predict that well then their planning would be on target.#Up to is clearly highlighted in your quote so not sure what you’re getting at there.And to the second piece, it also does not say it will be complete by the end of the quarter, it says it will be implemented over the quarter. Not only is there still time for that to materialize, but it’s also left open ended, more than once, probably for good reason.This is literally a non issue lol#So you lose some trust, but let's not overreact.#I hope not#Actually VET had spiked initially and THEN the day after was when many alts also spiked (along with VET will slightly going up)#You're just trying to bend words to not seem so wrong. Quarters aren't magic buzzwords, they are 3 month periods of time. No one has said they aren't going to complete the buyback, we're discussing what happens if they don't. There is no reason to continue this discussion as you're being disingenuous.#Gotta get that last word in I guess...#>but let's not overreactman, have you SEEN his comments here? That ship has sailed#Definitely not being disingenuous, but definitely agree no reason to continue the conversation. As I said, this a non issue.#Two ppl two opinions. Reality is that deadlines are often missed by businesses and it has very little impact if they deliver shortly after.#I'm gonna have to agree. They said no less than 5mil by the end of the quarter. Not by September 30th. I honestly wouldn't give a shit of the rest of the 5mil was sent to the wallet a week or 2 after the 30th. That's still roughly the end of the quarter. Everything here gonna be watching the wallet on September 30th at 11:59:59 expecting the final chunk. I don't think they give that much of a shit about the communities perceived deadline. They said quarter. So what if it's a week late or a week early. If they don't complete it at all then I'll be worried. Think about the logistics of it. Imagine if they were forced to buy that much and the price went 4x in a week. That can't look good either.#I am actually agreeing with ohredditplease, what a time to be alive. NON-ISSUE lol"

Enjoy the updates when they come. No point in lurking in the forums complaining about what’s not. Vechain is moving along at a good clip. As long as it doesn’t close up shop, we’ll be good in a few years. Your times better spent creating wealth elsewhere for now. Hoard those assets. I’m out for a while. Peace!#Just some thoughts for beginning of 2020.  About a week ago Sunny Tweeted ""**Digital wallets for 900,000 customers by Jan 2020""**The total VET supply is 86.7 Billion which generate 37.5 million VTHO per day.  (.000432 VTHO per VET)Considering these 900,000 wallets only, added to the fact that each clauses cost about 47 VTHO to be written to the blockchain. Each wallet doing only one clause per day will burn the entire VTHO supply and then some. (900,000 \* 47 = **42.3 Million VTHO burned per day**) I believe due to the nature of supply and demand that price will really start to move upward once we continuously burn more VTHO than generated daily. VET tokens will have more value as they are the only thing that can create more VTHO.YES this assumes each of the 900,000 wallets averages one transaction per day which does not seem to unreasonable. Maybe some do 0 while others do 10 or 20 a day.NOW add in the 35 thousand citizens of San Marino, The thousands (maybe millions) of Chinese hopefully starting to use the Carbon Credit App that just launched, Walmart China's up ramp of products (hopefully), the BMW Verfycar platform (coming), Chinese Natural Gas, Australian Steaks, Italian Wine, and several other small and big partners coming in the future. How can you not believe in the future of VeChain and realize the next 2-3 years can be absolutely awesome with so much potential. Just something to think about as we are in another big price slump and mood is not exactly positive right now. Keep your mind or big picture long term. Prices suck yea but I still want to buy more because I believe in the future.# m someone who has been reading and watching this Vechain group on and off for a few months, but has been hesitant to join.

A clause is a single write to the blockchain  A transaction can contain 1 clause or very many.

That's why for ordinary person buying and selling at the same time doesn't make any sense, while from company operations perspective this does make a lot of sense.The thing is, to understand processes which aren't that easy for most of us without proper explanations, we need at least to read next Executive Report (which is too totally approved an audited)#That's just noise.#Yeah, it has happened to me.

We need more transparency Sunny!!!! Hahaha.  For now I think our best performance measure is the Daily VTHO burn. Maybe we can get to a point where by tracking the transactions back to the Contract or Wallet that paid the VTHO we can determine who is the actual client. Doubtful however, if this was the case we could see exactly how ""active"" Walmart China has been in the last few weeks. I have seen estimates on things like the number of cars BYD has in China or the population of San Marino but that does not correlate to the actual users on the Blockchain for us.It is obvious that I am hoping the majority if the 900,000 DNV GL customers will actively use there wallets. I would hope a company this big would have data to support the customers would use the new service and wouldn't just offer it to them if there was not a need.   Back to big picture, I still see potential here as being huge. The solid foundation has been built, some big name partners have shown serious interest. It is all about how long we can wait for it to become mainstream. Is it 1-2 years or is it 5 years. I believe 2020 can be really exciting, mainly because I hope 900,000 DNV GL customers will kickstart the mass adoption. Start bringing the 1,000 companies in the ""pipeline"" mentioned about a week ago on board as well. I also do not think it hurts that VeChain can be he first blockchain project to show real utility on a commercial level. This could attract more business from other big name clients once they see it actually works live and full scale.  No matter what I do not see how we who have invested this early are not in a really good position come... say 2025 ish.#- Bright food wont generate that much tx since lots of the products comes in batches i guess - the 900.000 wallets we need to know if its one time storage or need those wallets updates and if yes how often will they update those certificates - byd & bmw would be nice to know how much tx each “message” to the retailers would create#>Vechain has all this internal metrics, we don't.

Vechain is not in a position to talk about progress from their clients.  It's up to the clients themselves....and they owe us nothing.#These questions should be directed at Walmart.

Never expected straight and continuous growth myself.#ok, thanks.  I misunderstood the operation.  I thought that we would see somewhat linear growth as each day built upon the preceding ones.  Your explanation corrects my misapprehension, and is much appreciated.#Same thing that happened for almost 2 years straight now?#Said this 2 weeks ago, the buyback will have zero lasting effects on the price. 25M VET per day is nothing compared to it's daily volume.#Actually once the buyback is ended or about to end I’d expect the price to be appreciated beacuse we’ll have less VET floating around.#Alot of bags to burn through initially#What do you mean with 7m?#There are many way to buy VET without causing a spike in sats. I believe foundation has lot of ammo for example buying VET by selling VTHO or OCE or SHA or any VET pair token. They can also convert fiat to btc to all those coins and then slowly buyback VET. The purpose is to buy low like any other logical investor. This might be the explanation why there are so many VET being transferred out from oceanex to binance and also huge transfer from binance to buyback wallet without causing a single sats move. Although i’m a bit disappointed but if we think longterm this buyback is a good indicator that the foundation themselves believe in the value of VET to appreciate in the future. Otherwise why would they buy now at the low? At this point we can only hope for the best in the longterm.#Is VTHO expected to hit $1 one day?#Is that with thunder nodes bonuses included?#[deleted]#gone where?#Got your back on this one#In any rational scenario, announcing a plan to purchase 10% of the supply of something should have an affect.Obviously in this scenario things are not above board and transparent.#Same here, I will DCA a bit further as I'm so close to a Thunder X but after that I'm done. Well over 25k EUR invested by that time which is enough as it is.#I agree with you on only putting in money you are willing to lose, but there has to be some sort of strategy with the DCA down. For example, maybe buy in $500 or so every time BTC drops $1k. I have a nice chunk of VET, but right now I share the sentiment of waiting for a change of pattern within the entire market before going back in. This is difficult to do when you understand that you can't time the market. I'm just speaking my thoughts as they come to me so I apologize for the back and forth.   I would guess the best strategy is to lower the amount of future investing and slowly trickle money in on the down trend until you are comfortable with the low price to drop a nice amount. (BTC @ $5000 or lower)#Check out the comments on the link above.   Apparently time stamps on comments for the video at its original source are from early July.

It is 700M, edited the post.#No. That's bitcoin you are thinking about.#That seems like a high number to me, for gas that's constantly being burned. Unlikely#I have heard two theories on this. **1**) The foundation wants to keep the VTHO price at 1/7 the price of VET tokens. IF this true VET would have to be $7.00 with a marketcap of $600 Billion. Possible maybe, if so still years away most likely. **2**) VTHO is the gas that powers the blockchain, I think the foundation will want clients to see the VTHO is fairly cheap which means lower cost to write to the blockchain. HOWEVER if the VET prices rise and they want to keep VTHO cheap they will have to up the generation rate. I.E, you will generate much more VTHO per VET token even though the VTHO price is low. **1**)So lets say you currently generate 100 VTHO a week. If VTHO price is $1 that means $100 a week dividend basically. **2**)Or VTHO price is still only $.05 BUT now you generate 2000 VTHO a week holding the same amount of VET as before. The VTHO is still worth $100 in a week. Current generation rate is .000432 VTHO per each VET token. Could generate more than that one day but it will never be less. According to the foundation it will never drop below the current level.#In theory. It could. A clause is around $0.02 now or 21 VTHO. If demand is sky high and we burned 37M vTHO while VeChain lowered the price of clause to 1 VTHO, the price would be $0.02. If price of a clause would be 0.02 VTHO , VTHO would be $1 when we do just under two billion clauses a day (and the price equals $0.02). So that’s around x10000 the volume compared to today.#My stepmom is expected to be hit for 1$ one day#Yes5Million VET and a Economic Thunder Node generates 2,160 VTHO off holding and another 685 VTHO from the node bonus. A total of 2,845 VTHO per day which is approx. 395 VET This all comes from the VTHO calculator from VechianStats. In my experience it seems fairly accurate.

It has no use case and no future. The only cryptos (my opinion), that have a chance at world wide addition are Monero and VeChain. Eth is like a proof of concept and what crypto brings to fintech...fintech already has but better. (Minus cheap cross boarder payments, but give that 2-3 years and it will be done)#Yes, people don't like to do research#👏🏼👏🏼 This guy gets it.#21 VTHO = 21.000 GASyou can check that on any transaction shown on VeForge, it shows GAS used and VTHO paid and its allways VTHO paid x1000 = GAS used#Lmao wow you are delusional man sorry to tell you. This crash is the bulls giving their pals one last chance to accumulate before btc goes for a run after the halvening#why would people buy gold bars? you think they wanna melt it and make rings from it? because it has a store of value. same with btc.you buy btc because you believe it has a store of value. thats why.  and its not going to triple digits like travelingarthur says. thats just thinking with emotions.#honestly i would buy BTC only for the $. not interested in its future or use case. i am interested in vechain for that like you though.#🤣🤣🤣 Alright man. Come back to me in December. Might be March depending on how this court case goes#wow so some people still believe in the store of value narrative. Bitcoin is at best a decent way of transferring value, but how can you believe for one moment that it's a **store** of value ? You know a lot of store of value that can lose 20% in a day, and 90% in a year ?#BTC doesn’t hit $20k without Tether. On Jan 2017, Tether printed $6.9Million. On Jan 2018, there were $1.6BILLION. Tether used $1.6Billion in fake money to manipulate the price up. $700-$20k happened purely due to Tether printing fake money and buying BTC on other exchanges. No Tether, no bull run.#A store of value is a hedge. It’s intended to have the same purchasing power when you bought it. There’s a reason gold, over a hundred years time, barely went up 100%.BTC will never be a store a value.The only reason BTC didn’t hit triple digits is because Tether stepped in and created $1.6Billion out of thin air. With USDT crumbling, and no fake money to save it...triple digits is inevitable.#Today's volume on BTC is over 8 billion! Why would 1,6 billion have such an effect?#lets agree to disagree. totally fine. guess we will see about that.#And on BAKT (where volume isn’t faked), the demand for bitcoin is less than 100 BTC in 2 days. Where real money is concerned, there is no demandWash trading and fake volume is how exchanges make their money.#Could you image the price of vet with a triple digit BTC#I agree with this but the volume on Binance is massive. They just became the biggest futures operation and that's on top of the whole exchange trading and lending. Don't underestimate the people that believe in alot of this technology, there is big money in this.#nobody can.#The number I pulled out of nowhere was $.001. But I didn’t understand how truly massive the sell pressure on VeChain has been. Wouldn’t be surprised if t hits $.0005. But at this point....no clue#Did someone say BIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTCOOOOONNNNNNEEEEEECCCCCCCTTTTTTT!!!!! ?"

Kinda confused about it would love some insight if anyone could explain.#When it comes to mainnet acitivty, would it be possible to see where the activity is coming from? Months ago we were getting hundreds of thousands of transactions but that quickly decreased. It makes me curious as to where the transactions came from as many of us assumed it was Walmart. Just my opinion but with blockchain being trustless and Vechain being transparent, these transactions should be identifiable.#Interesting, we haven’t gotten our typical transactions that come in the first couple of hours of a new day on veforge today#UPDATE on buyback progress ( [https://imgur.com/a/N6N4Yiv](https://imgur.com/a/N6N4Yiv) ). I added the deposits into the Foundation Buyback wallet that occurred over the weekend to the table I created previously. I see a total of **$4.01 Million Spent which leaves $980,000 left** to be bought by the end of the day. At .0034 per VET this is another 288 Million to be bought to make the $5 Million for this quarter. The prices were estimated but should still give a good idea of the buybuy progress. Price paid highlighted in grey is verified by the @BuyBackBot on Twitter.#This is a good day. I feel positive sentiment coming#>Another amazing night in Munich, time to go home.

A financial report should have disclosed how much vet was bought, on what date and for what price. The buyback purchases should be charted. A real buyback would have this information on the books.

Also, “keeping conspiracies aside”  *proceeds to insinuate a conspiracy* 🧐#>A financial report should have disclosed how much vet was bought, on what date and for what price. The buyback purchases should be charted. A real buyback would have this information on the books.  You are talking about a buyback of stocks, in a report for the stockholders, right? You see where I'm going with this, tokens not being stocks and us not being stockholders and thus not being owed anything like this. It's just a different relationship.That's not to say i wouldn't like to have this information too, but realize that this information will be very interesting for traders. The more transparent they are about their buying pattern the more it will likely be abused.#I've been told numerous times that dnvgl approved all of this and that's the end of it...

Once you fill a sell order, that sell order is gone#I don't know about your plan, my plan was that the amount of vet bought back equals the amount of vet drawn out from oceanex custodial wallet  [https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x64594d4e1c9296c15384441fc1640d9812b51ffd](https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x64594d4e1c9296c15384441fc1640d9812b51ffd)  (1,1 bil in 2 months)And we're just 70 million vet short of it (buyback wallet has 1,03 bil currently)These were the facts that I was saying “piling up” in my previous post. So everything goes just as I planned#I believe its a public holiday in China today#I fully agree with this however it seems the general consensus is that the purchases were made just prior to the deposits into the buy back account. I belive others have stated they see the volume spike on binance and oceanex a few hours prior to deposits.  Sunny has stated before this blockchain is built or trust and transparency so I would hope they are not playing ""shadow games"".This analysis is more or a general standing of the buyback progress. I am pleased with the progress so far and hope it continues.  I do not want to see investors start to lose trust in the foundation and then abandon there investment.#It's a possibility. First we need to grow the ecosystem by word of mouth. Get ya friends involved. Show them how. Get them excited about gaming at the amateur level that can yield financial benefits. I sure will :)#Yeah. In 10 years maybe#i think you have a reason to dream so, everything happens for a reason.#So with this stated I’m not complaining, it is just a general question. If the foundation is generating this much already with more to come by the end of the buy-back, are we seeing the true price of token right now? (with it being this low) Does it really matter if I even hold VET at this point to produce VTHO, as the company produces more than enough to fulfill the network’s needs?#Thank you. Didn’t think to even look in the financial report 😳The holdings of the foundation and the rate they generate vtho is playing on my mind more and more tbh. Time shall tell 😜#[deleted]#“ ** The ecosystem reserve was acquired through the VeChain Foundation Buyback initiative as of the end of July. This reserve will be used to facilitate the long term growth of the VeChain ecosystem.”This is the only information in the financial report vol.8 regarding the buy back. The ecosystem reserve has 190m vet in the chart. As per the report, the buy back wallet had 190m vet in it before the end of July 2019.  There is zero financial information regarding the buyback in the “financial” report.Im not insinuating anything. I am stating facts. I am trying to discuss with the community.#DNVGL did sign off on it alongside other members of the steering committee, just FYI. https://twitter.com/vechainofficial/status/1145258856399851520?s=21The long term aim of the buyback is to fulfil VET’s function as the store of value and roleas smart currency for the ecosystem (I assume that requires collateral) and to support builders, presumably through VTHO support and whatnot. DNVGL are one of the most respected companies on Earth. I understand what you’re implying, but I would suggest reading up on their business model. I’ve seen the attitude of the sub as of late. I am surrounded by engineers in my professional life and I know how integral DNVGL are to so many aspects of the business world. All I can say is, they simply could not afford to be tarnished. It’s literally their modus operandi to be above board and legit as the certifiers they are. Especially when it concerns a start up in a fledgling new industry and one that they’re risking so much with by attempting to digitise their entire business model and operations with.Of course, you guys can think as you wish. But I guarantee this will have already had legal scrutiny (there is a lawyer also sat on the steering committee FYI), because this business model simply cannot afford to be anything else but above board and compliant to operate globally and with the clientele it does.#I didn't take his comment as being genuinely annoyed lol...

Thank you for figuring it out!#[deleted]#Great insights T! :)#I don’t think this is the consensus, personally. The market data doesn’t show some of these large purchases which suggests to me a portion of them were bought OTC, the data for which doesn’t usually hit the market in the same way. I suspect they did a mixture of both. For example, we don’t see the 200M purchase impacting the market. However both Binance and OceanEx have OTC desks which we do see purchases from so that would fit this narrative. It’s always best to err on the side of caution to prevent disappointment. We don’t know the whole picture, we can’t therefore fill in all the gaps with guesses otherwise we’re just creating a false image. We don’t know how much is left, nor does the bot. Making an unequivocal statement is just setting people up to be disappointed. They’ve still spent millions of dollars so far, certainly nothing to be disappointed about IMO.#[removed]#Forget about the prices. It is quite obvious that at the state the market is right now, BTC dictates everything. Price is what you pay, value is what you get, and I think Vechain provides a lot more real world value than BTC does. Price will follow at some point.#It's not in the interest of the foundation to front-run the vtho market. They're too big for that. They can do that, but it would plummet the price of vtho.#Do you think we’ll burn more than 10 million daily VTHO in the future?#I have the same question/concern#I’m not the biggest fan and believe it’s the biggest hurdle I face with the token aka “my investment” increasing in value in the future, that coupled with the understanding (I believe?) that the foundation could adjust the amount of vtho required (so they could simply level it out with the amount they generate)  and we could all be “removed” from this equation and it would still tick along perfectly.#I'm guessing the next quarter will have full disclosure as the buyback was completed during that time period.#Ok.. so they did mention it then. What else did you want to know? The specific hashes to every transaction? The balances of all their accounts? What are you asking for? They’re purchasing a huge sum of $ of their own token to support its future and people here create drama about it? What even is there to conspire about? They said they’d spend a large amount of money of their own accord on their own tokens, which they have proceeded to do. And it’s still not good enough? I’m not surprised the engagement of this sub is diminishing when all onlookers read is a bunch of petulant, entitled ejits infighting about how a private company spends millions of its own dollars. I’d rather cover my eyes in jam and let wasps eat it than listen to more of this entitled behaviour. And you guys wonder why VeChain stopped releasing information about partners and projects. It’s because you’ll literally trip over yourselves to create FUD (some of you. Plenty of you this doesn’t apply to). Enough Reddit for me tonight. Peace out.#Thank you for reminding me of this information soloman. I am trying to remain skeptical of vechain, even though i am 100% in to the vechain ecosystem with my crypto investments. I have been burned in the past and try to manage what i can to not get burned again. This is the sort of reply i was welcoming.  Keep up the great work. Cheers!#Thank you for taking the time to type out exactly what I think everytime anyone questions the legitimacy of the operations of VeChain.#I do understand dnvgl is well established and well respected.Crypto currencies are not as well respected and well established. Exchanges are plagued with wash trading and numerous other activities that would be illegal in other markets. The fact is that, observing this buyback has produced questionable things. Namely hundreds of millions of vet being transferred to binance, and hundreds of millions transferring out, with no noticeable bump in volume especially, or price. Some chalk it up to buying small amounts over longer periods, some chalk it up to buying otc.The thing is that we don't know, but we know it was not a market buy.So I will continue to question the goings on of this buyback until I am satisfied things are on the up and up.So far I am not convinced... And just because dnvgl gave their consent, doesn't 100% guarantee its being done properly.#Check his history. Nothing but neggatronium. In that context, you might see it differently.#Can't wait to see what annoying bs you cry about tomorrow.#So it’s best to sell Xnodes when vet price is down. Get more vet. And then when vet appreciates again, buy your xnode back for $2k equivalent#Yep you're right. Seems to be pretty stable around $2k. Ever since the X node market was opened it's been hovering around that amount. And even before that people were selling their X nodes for $2k (selling their private key and charging $2k extra for the X status). This kinda leads me to believe that X nodes will never really appreciate in value, making it not as good of an 'investment' as some people think it is.#I dont really have any numbers I mean I was just guessing and ball parking.#I’ve been here for almost a couple of years now, the progress I’ve seen the last few months excites me a great deal. I don’t expect valuable tokens until they start delivering proper economic value, we’re close, but still not quite there yet. I don’t base my feelings on price so, for me, I haven’t been all too bothered. It would have been great to have a crystal ball so I could have taken better advantage, sure, but the company is still progressing very nicely and the metrics that will lead us to success in the long run are developing well. I’m just happy I found this project before it really takes off. I’m sorry you don’t feel the same, but we are still much better off than two months ago by the metrics that matter most (Tx growth) cause that’s where we ultimately derive our value from.#Appreciated! :)#$1 is possible. $.10 is most likely the high within next two years, and that’s with mass adoption. Speculative of course, but the gaming industry is much quicker to adopt new technology compared to any other industry.#Good point, furthermore VeChain would need to amass way more tokens to match daily vtho generation right? I think it was you who did that calculation in a previous post.#Not “very”, but def positive#This may help give us an idea of the number of transactions that are coming from china.#one week off for China#Puh i was shocked for a moment , thanks for the info#You choose to be negative, I choose to be positive. You are worried about being disappointed, I am not. With the data we have available this is the best way to have a general idea of the progress of the buyback. Take it as a baseline and adjust according to your beliefs of when the actual purchase happened.  It is not a false image, it is a generalized image that gives a better dollar value than the one listed in Veforge Explorer. That value is just the real time $$ value of the wallet and some people are using it to judge the progress of the buyback.#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

Just wanted to try and get a snapshot of exactly we are looking at if possible.#[removed]#I do, so in that case that would make my VET valuable by producing VTHO however, how much VTHO must be burned on a daily basis to increase the price to at least $0.2? Obviously speculation plays a factor in price when predicting. Does all of this point towards the current price being an accurate/reasonable price for the token and the only thing making it fluctuate is speculation? Still trying to understand everything within the space as far as price, so please bare with me. I just want to become a little more knowledgeable on the inner workings so I can make investing decisions.#When VTHO burned is less than VTHO generated in the long run, 27% of the VET total vet supply wouldn't be able to sustain it.  It would need more, and that's where we come in.#At one point, there may be much less VET to go around. Think complete success.. like the back of an old I Mac shirt.. once said, Think different. I can see what you are saying, but just possibly, vthor becomes used in droves to power valuable transactions and blockchain solutions across the globe. Like how Microsoft had direct x and made it easier for programers and game devolpers to on board their ideas. Or perhaps closer to the internet, and how it gave birth to valuable transactions. How does one use thor then? How does a company buy Vet then? They probably would have a difficult time, but then again, by that time, if at all, the world would be flooded with thor transactions. And if you don't hold any VET, then you accept Thor. I don't really worry about it as much as you do, because the end goal is proper. I honestly believe they are thinking way bigger than you have ever imagined. There will be a future where people are paid in real time with something similar to thor. And big business could pull it off probably better than anyone else.. Since they pay our politicians bills. It is time to move money instantly. It is time to get rid of our over inflated dollar. Let's roll.#Yes and i said they didn’t release any relevant financial information.Are you even trying to understand what i am saying? Have you ever read a companies quarterly financial report in your life? They are very different then this. I told you what i’m asking for. If they want to be transparent and have financial reports then do it properly.Just because you don’t like what i have to say, doesn’t mean you need to get defensive and go on a tantrum. Get some exposure in the real world and maybe you will understand.#No problem. It’s natural to feel uncertain with any investment. The future is unknown, all we can do is make an educated decision and hope things work out as planned. If they do, the rewards can be great when it comes to emergent technologies. It’s happened many times (smart phones, internet, computers etc). For me, knowing what I know (from my real life work) about the imminent digitisation of the global economy, how integral blockchain is to that new age of data collection/collation, how integral DNVGL are systemically and what I’ve seen thus far with the partnerships and progress and the fortune 500s that are staking their digital futures on VeChainThor, I feel very confident. I know it’s not the same for everyone though, we are 50,000 people with different lives, opinions and thought processes. We just gotta help each other through the natural see-saw of the human psyche until things can truly unfold. 2020 isn’t far away. Lots of use cases to start coming online. Very excite.#If the price was a lot better, but the buyback was still like this, would you feel less invested in your crusade here?#Meh, not worth it. Could be, could be#At least that's the theory. Sold my X-Node because of that almost 2 days ago. We'll see how it turns out.I also realized that my VTHO bonus with only 600k in the wallet is so freaking small and that it'd be much more worth it to have an Eco-Node with 1.2M. That way I'd generate about 100k+ VET more in 5 years (assuming all the parameters stay the same). Plus I deem it very improbable that an X-Node would sell for something like $600k if VET ever reaches $1. So even if VET skyrockets and for some miracle reason X-Nodes rise to 700k (VET/USD), I didn't even make a loss (except for those other (marginal) X-Node benefits).#Price isn’t something that really matters currently to me because I’ve seen what VET can go to. I know this is only temporary. I just want to see those 400k+ clause days again 😋#Hey guys, I love Plair (I'm actually balls deep into VET and PLA), but you have to be realistic...$1 PLA means a market cap of $100 Bn... even Twitch doesn't have that...$0.01 in the next 2 to 5 years is already a nice target and very nice gains if you get in now.#To match daily generation rate you'd need 100% of the vet.They will generate the %of daily gen rate based on the % of total vet they have.I believe they have around 27%, so they'd generate 27% or so of the vtho#The majority by the looks of it so far. The main net without Chinese involvement is as flat as 2 week old pepsi.#I can assure you I don’t feel negative nor was my message, I’m just presenting a more realistic case to temper people’s expectations because that’s how you create disappointment by stating: “we are due X amount more tokens” when you actually have no idea. When you make assumptions, you set people up to be disappointed.#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

I find it quite unbelievable that people quibble when a private company chooses to spend its own funds on its own products and even that act can be turned to a negative. It’s not a tantrum, it’s disbelief at the sight of what I assume are adults expressing attitudes I would assume of a 14 year old not getting their own way.#What more can i say, you nailed it. Thats why you are a mod. Hopefully all of us can look back at these rough years with the benefit of hindsight and laugh at some of our comments. I feel particularly excited about the next quarter for some reason. But the next few years should be interesting to say the least!#I've said it before... I truly believe vechain will be the most used blockchain in the world, and by all rights should be a top 5 currency.And I think when this market smartens up it will be. Until then I want vechain to be a shining beacon of what crypto and blockchain should strive to achieve.However, when I see things that don't add up or don't make sense I'm going to question it. Vechain has enough people calling it a China scam so it want to fight that the best I can.I won't be convinced until I am satisfied how you can claim to purchase 200m vet when the daily volume on the exchange is 39 bitcoin total.If it was otc then fine, but I want proof of that, because that is not the open market like they announced it would be.And I don't believe they bought small amounts over months and just transferred when they felt like it because that itself is derelict in their duties by leaving funds on an exchange for an extended period of time.#Only a matter of time my man! DNVGL coming online soon. Should lead to some tasty action#I should of clarified. $1 in the next decade. Not necessarily next few years. $.10 in a few years is possible if adoption materializes quickly.#C’mon guys.. The next report will have the buyback included. No need to argue. We’ll have to wait and see what the next instalment has in store.#Not sure why you say i am acting like a 14 year old when i have done literally nothing but state facts and ask for a discussion.  This conversation has been derailed, so I don’t see much point in trying to discuss with you.#Instead of claiming you understand well enough to know something fishy is going on, just admit to yourself you don't understand. You may want to see big market buy orders on a single day but it is a silly expectation, and all of your other assumptions follow from there.#I know it might just seem an annoying nuance, but they never actually promised it would be bought from the open market. Just that the value of the total ($5M) would be that of the open market at the respective time of purchase. It’s a tiny but important piece of wording because it completely changes the outcome. They bought some from the market by the looks of things, but they also bought some from OTC addresses, which suggests a mixture of the two took place.#900k wallets 😍#I’m sorry. It’s late and I’m tired. Peace out#One day we will reminisce about these times. We watched a beast be born, blood guts and all#Have a good sleep!"

This was during that long ass AMA he did. I think it was 8 hours or something? or 16 hours, I dunno. Take that with a grain of salt sure, it's nothing concrete. I take it as the information he's able to share.#They have done a few of those the past few months. They're videos on YouTube#Would be great to hear from you after the presentation!#I think the market that they are after is huge (and getting much bigger by the month). But the execution so far has been slow  mainnet beta was delayed 6-7 months compared to the original roadmap, and very few features are out. No chat, still can't create your own tournament, and 3rd game is yet to launch despite promises of it launching in September. It's a pretty primitive platform still, which is not so bad considering that it's far more difficult to implement than most people think. Also, not much marketing yet... looks like the same 15-20 players participate in the matches. Definitely not much traction there... YET. This could drastically change by Q1 of 2020. Worst thing is virtually 0 transparency. No communication from the team except the occasional (once every 2-4 weeks) chat by Pat on telegram, thanking the community for being patient. Only one AMA session so far, and that was almost a year ago. This gives off a bad image, and apparently has been raised on telegram multiple times with no reaction from Pat or tg admins. I'll be honest  I'm invested in PLA, but currently I'm not VERY confident about it. If other feature updates roll out as a quicker pace, and the team actually starts to market the platform outside the tiny scope of VeChain fans, then holding my bag will feel a lot better :)#i was a gamer( only counterstrike) in my teenager years and i was damn good at it. if we wanted to play tournaments for prices, we had to go to lanpartys and game a whole weekend and at the end of it our price was like a 100-200$ , a new keyboard or a graphic card and a ticket for an other lan party. and we went on an on. back then, there was not even a possibility to get rich or earn good money of it like it is now. but if there was a platform back in my days like the plair platform where you can earn crypto rewards for winning games, streaming content, etc.. and i calculate all the time i wasted on that computer and winning all these tournaments i could have made good money i guess.. you get me, im balls deep in plair. and ""IF"" (not saying it will but IF) they succeed and this platform gets very popular by gamers, hell this is a very good investment and i will be a happy camper some day..#I got a bit just in case.

Maybe. But.

X node would be more worth. But just my opinion.#Most of them are VIP 191.. so cant be Walmart or ?Can u specifiy what Transactions u mean?#It’s Golden Week in China. It will probably be low all week, it’s a national holiday.#Chinese holiday week#Economic nodes don’t cost a thing . Just hold a million , press upgrade and wait 10 days . Don’t let anyone fool you  )#you wont lose the 1m vet#Never buy economic nodes.#>News flash to the whiney little bitches: The foundation owes you nothing.People are definitely whining but I think I dislike this attitude even more. You say this like it's supposed to make people come to their senses but the fact that people have invested millions of dollars into an unregulated organization that has no responsibilities to you is just more fuel for people's skepticism. Especially when they've gotten paid and the people here have borne the losses. The whining is just a symptom of investors who currently have lots of losses yet little info about the future of their investment. Unless they address people's concerns, or people see enough vtho usage, or just price action to feel more confident then this whining you're talking about probably isn't going anywhere. Frankly, people should be skeptical.#[deleted]#VeChain’s tokenomics are dependent on more VTHO being burned than is being produced daily. We haven’t hit that yet. This is how the economy is designed to detach from Bitcoin, which currently, largely drives the market. If you zoom out from VET, the whole market has been sliding since January 2018. Everything has taken a significant hit after the bubble we saw in 2017. There are many projects with no futures and much uncertainty. There will likely be a trigger again to fuel another speculative rally, that trigger will most likely be real world application and utility, ushering in a new wave of interest. Regards VeChain, it has been consistently achieving, forging key partners with Fortune 500s and building out the ecosystem. We need those partnerships to translate to activity on mainnet now to start driving scarcity in VTHO and value in to the ecosystem. DNVGL, for example, recently said 900,000 of its enterprise wallet would be in the hands of its clients by Q1 2020. 2020 and beyond were cited as years when operational income would start in a meaningful way for VeChain (as per the whitepaper). In essence, it’s a waiting game, as with any investment. You are speculating on future value. By their own projections, 2021 and beyond will be when things are really kicking off. VeChain is a real business - 5+ years of development before massive success is fairly par for the course. VeChain has been around since 2015 and is certainly on the right track and 2020 is not far away. When DNVGL and its many use cases come online, it should be quite fun to watch.#Crypto market cap dropped, bitcoin dropped, altcoins dropped even harder. Now market waits for a new wave of investors that don’t read financial reports.#If you bought in when it was VEN, there was a mainnet release (VET) that brought the total supply up to ~55 Billion. That was the main cause of the sharp decrease in price. Other than that, it's the irrational market and crash from the 2017-2018 ALT craze. The partnerships that VeChain have announced would have caused a spike to at least $.50 in the 2017-2018 ALT season imo.#Good point below: Do you have VEN or VET? Because you’ll need to convert your tokens if they’re still VEN.#Don't tell me what to do!!!#You too mate#[removed]#When total volume goes up past 15 btc and each Satoshi sell wall gets less than 30btc#We are on it. Heading back to earth. Fasten your belt for the most turbulent ride of your life.#The price is over 50% less than when the buyback began. The value of the pot has dropped which would explain the discrepancy. We don’t know specific times when the VET were bought, either which muddies the value we see now.#I would appreciate a timeline from their side when they are done. Other than that I understand why they don't go into specifics during the phase.#It probably is 5m and those who try to guesstimate when and how much they bought are off with their numbers.#I updated this table on Monday ( [https://imgur.com/a/N6N4Yiv](https://imgur.com/a/N6N4Yiv) ) This is my best estimate of how much was bought back and the dollar amount associated it with. My ESTIMATE is that the foundation was a little under $1 Million short. Some of these VET could have been bought days prior (at a higher price) before they were transferred into the buyback wallet. The wallet has 1.031 Billion VET in it, if total USD purchase was $5 Million this is an average of .004845 per VET. It is reasonable to think the foundation did purchase $5 million worth.Big picture, I am not worried about this at all and have trust in the foundation to keep there word. I would like to see an overview of the buyback for the quarter published by the foundation in the near future. I do not doubt the foundation and do not want to create more of a negative sentiment.If you are looking for red flags or do not believe in this project I am sure you can find a different coin to invest in. Just my thought.#Where are you getting this 3.5 million figure?#Oh damn, I didn't think of this. That would be awesome if they were full VP191 clauses. This would make sense since they'd need to have fee delegation for this. This is going to make me check these every day now. Damnit.#They did just apparently go LIVE on the 1st, right?#[https://medium.com/@ziheng.zhou/what-you-might-not-know-about-vechainthor-yet-part-iii-transaction-fee-delegation-vip-191-4ee71d690f1b](https://medium.com/@ziheng.zhou/what-you-might-not-know-about-vechainthor-yet-part-iii-transaction-fee-delegation-vip-191-4ee71d690f1b)This will help break it down.#Probably all of them, hence “multinational.”#He was talking about the company being a multinational. Also those are multiple nations. What do you mean, ORP?#Yep the simpler the on-ramps, the more likelihood for widespread adoption#Ah cheers Jk. Always enjoy your posts - and all the other die-hards out there. Keep on Vechainin'#Ah nice, I must have missed them,#There are medium articles tooExample:https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/partner-update-and-spotlight-series-enn-9c5a61db7c5d#It is so frustrating to want to be able to buy the crypto you want only to see it on an exchange that currently not available to your area. This to me is the MOST irritating problem in crypto. There are other projects I want to invest in but a person is restricted from doing so because the exchanges allowed where you live don’t have them. For so many things I have to sit on the sidelines and wait to see if things get approved 1. By the country or state, and 2. By the exchange.#Sure but you realize we get negative flashback when chinese holidays are used to explain poor crypto performance yes...#Is the low carbon ecosystem enabled in those trucks? I thought it was just 6 models of their electric cars.#It's the same as Walmart, it's not such a big setup, more of a POC in a couple of stores or a bunch of lorries in this case.#Is that Chinese New year's Eve or regular new year's Eve? 🤣#So? This needs to be emphasized. We will soon be in the 2020 phase, which they stated would be real building and value generating.#You only have to pay for the VTHO to be transferred to your wallet. This only costs about 2 cents per transfer. I got a Node and do it about every month or so.  You can do the calculations by yourself here: [https://vechainstats.com/vtho-calculator/](https://vechainstats.com/vtho-calculator/) I'd definitely say that it's worth it! Do you already have enough VET or are you contemplating to get more to get a Node? If you already have enough you should definitely get one as you'd be missing out on free VTHO!#:(Thanks for your reply.#I was referring to the current transaction volume on mainnet, but you made a very good point.Since its VIP 191, i agree with you. We should not expect current volume on mainnet to be Walmart.Thank you for this insight!#I wish we could tell what transactions are coming from what entity.   Like is Walmart literally closed all week in China?#I remember this happening before during a holiday. Thanks for the info.#Thank you#Thanks for the answer.  that I wanted to know.#[deleted]#People investing millions in a high risk investment, in a highly unregulated market are a) stupidb) greedyc) informed People investing based on information still need to think about how much money they put into this. Sometimes you can be informed but greedy and you invest too much.The whining comes from people a) and b) or from very impatient c) typesI mean, bear market is disappointing but it‘s nothing else: a bear market where every project suffers. You won‘t find a more transparent and reliable crypto project than VeChain right now. Everything else (even BTC) is pure speculation. With VeChain at least you have (small level right now but still) adoption and top partners. So it‘s one of the smartest investment decisions you can make in crypto.#It's what every project in the crypto space says. They don't owe token holders anything. They build all their companies on the back of crypto holders, but ofc they owe nothing to them.#luckily I'm not here to look smart or cool.Edit: I don't disagree with you, though. I get the VTHO that I'm entitled to and a foundation that's working to increase its value.#did you know what you were signing up for? obviously not.#What was the ICO price? 1 ETH = 4,025 VEN (402,500VET)?Edit: it was regular price 1 ETH for 3500 VEN (350,000 VET) Price has tanked from ATH, but still above ICO price#Agreed. They have been hitting their milestones in stride and making tons of meaningful partnerships. At the most recent chinese blockchain conference (Wanxiang), they revealed that VeChain has over 100 fortune and 1,000 enterprise company partnerships already in the pipeline... that is reassuring to say the least.To see the partnership stats: https://twitter.com/benyorke/status/1174015246568218624#Did I miss the bitcoin financial report?

All we can see are TX's incomming to the wallet. But what's the point in hiding your buys if you have already bought?#Yes would be great indeed. Dont know why everybody is downvoting this, this is an important question imo.#But its still a 1.5 Million$ gap thats not a little bit if can understand my perspective. Why are they so mysterious about their buying prices? I just simply would love to know more whats going on behind the buyback-scenes.#Wow first comment with acctual content and no excuse. Thanks for sharing this, helps me alot. I had a number in Mind that was arround 3-4 mill aswell. You have a good attitude Im not worried at all either, I just want to know whats happening, and why, thats the only process of learning. To understand whats going on. Sure Im diversifiying my portfolio, but I dont mind VET in my folio.

So.. if thats the case, these trucks havent got anything to do with Vechain.#Need to be emphasized with “hold onto your butts”?You can then reemphasize everything since China Tobacco and continue with vaccines solutions to be rolled out across the China.Let’s bring things to the surface when there is something substantial to talk about.#I did it 💪#Keep in mind. Vechain is built with a 500fortune usage-vision. In the future, when real adoption of those companies kicks in... you will wish you got every possible node you could get your hands on today. Regardless if it were an Xnode or Economic node.#Youre welcome. Dont get distracted by my comment. VeChain is still a great investment with or w/o economic node. When you hit 1Mil VET just get a economic node. Its for free. :D#The Golden Weeks in China are huge national events, tons of people go on holidays, visit families etc. I can’t speak for the whole country, but many key facilities and functionalities shut down, even government services such as tax#Upgrade then wait#>You won‘t find a more transparent and reliable crypto project than VeChain right now.You're probably right about that. It's the only alt coin I'm willing to take a risk on at the moment. But at the same time, just because it's transparent compared to other projects doesn't mean it's transparent enough. This is the primary reason some well known investors call btc and other cryptocurrencies ""rat poison"". Not just because they think specific projects are scams but because there isn't enough info to make an informed valuation in this space. We still have no idea what kind of money customers are actually spending right now to use Vechain let alone what we can expect them to spend in the future. While future adoption looks positive, the lack of information coming out of this project would be alarming to any traditional investor.#They owe us what they promised us, and they are basically the only project to have delivered on every single promise thus far. They don’t owe us the crazy things people are demanding sometimes in here.#[deleted]#>What was the ICO price?...still above ICO priceCrypto projects release only a small percentage of the supply.  Hype the project.  Pump the price.  And dump larger and larger percentages.  That is where the money is made.  It's is misleading to say they only sold at $XX at ICO when the foundation and founders still held most of the supply after ICO.#Ico price is still less than half of current price in usd#Maybe they’d rather remain aloof to stay one step ahead of the market. Better to keep your enemies guessing then tell them your war strategy and have them preempt your moves. We are likely to see more detailed information in the next financial report. Whether they will detail fiat dealings I can’t be sure, they usually only disclose the public holdings of the foundation.#I think the more transparant they are about their buying pattern the more it can be abused by traders. Also in general the more information they give the more questions and fud#A bit hypocritical here bud. We're mostly salty because of all the people whining about the price/buyback/etc. Everyone feels mega entitled to know literally every step of every partnership and every purchase of the buyback and exactly at what price and everything.Guess what. They didn't have to announce buyback, let alone from open market, and EVEN give a public address where they'd send all the tokens. And then people come here and complain and ""just wanna know whats going on"" as if they've been personally targeted by the foundation doing something slightly different than everyone false expectation in their mind.That's why you're getting down voted. And this isn't the first comment. We've been talking about this for weeks and the matter of fact is no one REALLY knows. It's all speculation but we mostly agree that /u/jeff_5_7 and /u/vx7777 are pretty close with their predictions/theories.Everyone wants to know what's happening and why. Guess what though. This is crypto. Those are 2 things you'll hardly ever get here. No one knows and anyone that does is making an educated guess or straight up talking outta their ass. Vechain community is more towards educated guess on the spectrum but we got our fair share of ass talkers too.#VIP-191 transactions spiked up about 24 hours before the counter on World Food Chain's website hit zero.  Doesn't mean it isn't related, but if it is, then I'm not sure what the counter actually corresponded to.#:-)#Ohhhhh, I see. Ha, the difficulty of reading text VS hearing it. Didn’t even interpret it your way!#yet....#Good thing I can express my opinion here without being criticized#You do realize he asked if he should get a strength node. You said no. He says thank you. And you reply by saying to get the exact thing he was asking about. Read before answering.#That‘s why investing in crypto is actually not a very smart decision at all. Too many risks, no regulation, no transparency, shady actors, immature social media communities...Hell we should be relying on relevant and independent news platforms with a high reputation. Instead we rely on team website, youtube shill videos, Twitter fanboys, Discord „paid leaders“, Facebook groups and Reddit trolls.Not talking VeChain but crypto as a whole is a pretty ridiculous space for any outsider. It just doesn‘t make any sense to normal people.#Dude, all I'm saying is that this is fucking crypto - anything can happen. We're gambling. I'm not sure what your're going on about with your ICO argument. Yes, ICOs are are designed to raise money? And as far as I can see, they're delivering with the money they took from investors. They can't control the market, and they didn't force you to hit the ""buy vet"" button on Binance. And I'm pretty sure the ENTIRE market was in full hype mode at that time - it's just that VeChain had a lot more than most projects to share. No one is asking you to act like none of that happened. It did. What's your point?""when you take someones money you owe them something.""Uh, dude, again, you invested in the most speculative market in the world. That's not how any of this works. The SEC isn't here to protect anyone. They made no promise to anyone about any kind of future return. When you invest in traditional stocks you're not promised anything in exchange for your money, either - only what the SEC requires. And I'm pretty sure they don't ""hype"" anything anymore for exactly this reason - because they've received so much backlash. And for the record, I don't think they ""hyped"" things in order to be deceitful - the entire market was in a state of euphoria.#Well it seems their plan did not go off if they made a 1.5 Million loss in their ""strategy"".#While I appreciate being mentioned, I am just a guy with a keyboard and to much free time at work. I do have a masters degree in Transportation from a well know US school. My education showed me the importance of the logistics and transposition behind goods and services that are required to keep a developed country functioning. This ties into the supplychain industry and the next level tracking services offered by the VeThor Blockchain. I see the big picture behind this project and believe it to be important for the future of our world. Most of my post on here are related to math and numbers behind the ecosystem as I try to understand more about the day to day operations. I have only been active in the space for 5 or so months. I strive to learn more and more about this project everyday and spend alot of time doing my own research. have serious respect for /u/vx7777 but am not quite sure I fall in the same category as he when it comes to knowledge behind the scenes.#Its true they dont have to do all of this stuff, but we started a new type of transparancy with cryptocurrencies. I see that as a standard in crypto before I think about investing into any kind of project. Times have changed, imo its good that people start to ask questions, that means they are awake. But I got your point, maybe I should have checked if someone posted about it before, but anyways, Im glad to be here like ya'll. :) Have a nice day my friend!#Good observation. Like I said, I don’t actually know :) could be all manner of things. We know there are a ton of use cases in the pipeline.#Sure dude, no problem, you just reposted an article from 2018 with zero new data except holding for our butts. Thanks for your positivity, but you can start reposting every single article from 2017 with the same level of success#Looool just lol#This is part of the problem of being too early. 5-10 years from now we will look back at this and think of how silly it all was.#You as well amigo.#I'd guess it came from a single implementation/project - So this might be it. I would be hard pressed to believe it was a few projects coming online at the same day together. The transactions aren't small fries either, and if they're going to be doing this much out of the gate, I imagine we'll see it ramp up as the weeks/months move on.That number will be interesting to graph out. It did start off on a Monday so it'll be fun to see how it does over the weekend which traditionally our transactions drop. And they COULD have started Monday before the countdown finished, just to make sure everything was rolling for the countdown to finish, I don't believe that would be too far fetched. It wouldn't be great for the ball to drop and something be wrong with the rollout.#He asked if the node was worth it. You said no. But the vet was. How can you own a node without the vet? You can't. So if vet is worth but the node isn't, then a strength node is still worth getting because those 2 investments are linked at the hip. Loool yourself man.#I correct you he asked if an Economic Node was worth it not a node itself. Thats why I reminded him that its free anyways.#i think he meants something like if you own 800k vet you shouldnt hurt yourself and buy 200k extra to have that node status because atm that status isnt really worth it. and hes right too.#What do you mean. An economic node = strength node = ""a node itself""."

When you see buy and sell orders in the 20-40M (!) range and everyone comes to the party at the same time, you can assume whale wars of course. I still think there‘s a chance the buyback program was partly put in place to allow team bonus to be sold without hurting the price. Imagine if all team members would start selling their bonus from the last 2 years (not the C-level, the regular members), that would be a bigger disaster for the price development.So a buyback program makes sense.#I've been out of the loop for a week or so.

No I wouldnt market buy and neither would they if they really wanted to buy. I would buy in parts, few mil at a time. You accumulate in a way so that people dont notice it. That takes time. Whales that bought up thousands of btc at 3-4ks didnt do it by placing a mutlimillion dollar wall. They bought silently, in parts, then pumped when they were ready. Same goes here. If this was a real buy, it wouldnt happen this way. Plus the 100mil wall popping up and down about 3 sats lower. You really think thats a legit buy order....? Im tired of this manipulation. This simply smells. I hope we arent all getting played again and once the walls get removed we continue da drop. Which if I had to make a bet, would probably be the most likely scenario imo, but thats not the point. Im not here to fud, just wanted to point out that the manipulation continues, irrelevant of the direction.

Yet because we‘re still underrated and because of manipulation, pessimistic views are dominant. No reason to be lower than Top 5 MC right now.

Even if you are able to calculate the time-discounted future value of a network, it won't matter much in the short term if no one else is using the same metrics.  You might be able to correctly evaluate a crypto network, but if the rest of the market has no idea how to do so, then the market value might never catch up to the true network value. But let's say the market value will eventually come into line with the network value.  How do you determine the network value?  You bring up a business doing 20k/week in sales, and that metric probably works in traditional businesses.  But those business tend not to get value from the network effect.  A better comparison for value might be social networks who get most of their value from Metcalfe's Law.  Social networks have valuations based on daily active users though, and if that's the framework we want to use, this whole crypto space is likely WAY overvalued at the moment.  [There are only 90,000 daily users](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/stats) in the entire crypto space, compared to [1.59 billion daily users on Facebook](https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/).  A network is only useful if the person you want to transact with is also on the network.  For instance, I can't send my SHA tokens to someone who only has a Bitcoin wallet!It might be easier to compare against other crypto-platforms instead. As for comparing our VTHO burn to other networks, how much gas did Ethereum use this week?  How much BTC was used in fees this week?  Paying for transactions is a good indication that people are getting more value out of the network than they are putting in.  Otherwise, they wouldn't pay the fees to use the network.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the numbers on ETH burn, but if someone else could, that would be awesome.Another metric is transactions.  [Blocktivity](https://blocktivity.info/) has a neat metric called Activity Valuation Index (AVI), which divides transaction count by marketcap and then compares that value to Bitcoin's ratio.  According to this AVI, Ethereum is undervalued by 8x compared to Bitcoin, Nano by 22x,  VeChain is undervalued by 45x, and EOS by 3,342x.  EOS can spam transactions for free though, so how much value does that network actually provide?Clearly, none of these metrics can provide a full picture of valuation, but when taken together, I think they can help to assign value to a network.#I would agree that valuation could be considered as fair. But relatively to 90 other shitcoin projects below or above, it‘s not.#Yup...I have been doing that...and nothing#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

VET is currently not, so the network effect is not as big of a deal. Is there a network effect to using AWS? Probably, but it's not really something you take into account when it comes to modeling its market value. The biggest variables we currently need for VET is to figure out how many transactions there will be and how much they will cost.#Feels like our balls might return to their normal color.#Holding Vet feels like a never ending prostate check anyway haha#Hmmm that is puzzling.

It has very low utility. You cannot practically use it as a currency since either the transaction fee is too high, or they are too slow. Bitcoins only ""utility"" is that it is considered a ""store of value"", which could be said about any cryptocurrency (VET included) out there.Point is that Bitcoin is a very poor comparison for anything, since most of its valuation is pure speculation with 0 real world utility.#AWS probably doesn't have much of a network effect, you're right.  But imagine if AWS instances were shareable with other AWS customers.  Then the network effect would start to add some value.  Public blockchains are like that - they can add value to a database via the network effect because they are publicly accessible databases.#But it can't be said about VET because most people are not using it for that and it doesn't claim to be for that. People are actively using btc as a store of value and people are actively making purchases with it(even if it's not good at it). At the end of the day regardless of what you think btc is, it is heavily defined by the size of the network. It's not a store of value or a currency if there is no one you can sell it to. VET on the other hand could potentially still have the same value to you even if you're the only one on the network.#VET is actually considered a store of value and ""smart money"" according to the white paper. Though, I agree with you that most people don´t consider it as such at this moment. My point is that there is no technical limitations why VET (or almost any other crypto out there) couldn´t be a store of value or a currency such as Bitcoin is. It is just what people believe, which makes Bitcoins valuation full speculation, since it does not offer any other utility, unlike VET."

We started talking about blockchain and I told him about Vechain and gave him some examples of how you can track foods/drinks, how you could validate a Gucci bag to be real and some things about supply-chain. He then asked me if I could make a small document of how two of his new companies could benefit from using Vechain. (He really likes new technology)one of the companies is focused on biodegradable fluids used in geothermal well drilling/pumping to improve pipe-flow and leave no toxicity behind in the earth, these fluids can also be used for cleaning/improving other pipelines (oil pipelines, water pipelines etc) but the starting focus is aimed at geothermal and oil drilling. This product is finished and ready for usage.The other company is building a more efficient and eco-friendly drill that can also be used in both geothermal wells and oil wells.

The article states “the VeChain Foundation recently announced a VET buyback plan worth up to $25 million. The first phase of the buyback, which amounts to no less than $5 million on the open market, will be implemented over the next quarter, starting in July 2019.”   It doesn’t actually say they will buy it on the open market.  They are calling it a buyback plan that will be worth up to 25$ million. It says the first phase of the buyback will be implemented over the next quarter. It also says that the phase will amount to no less than 5$ million on the open market. It seems clear that they transferred vet to Binance wallet then transferred it out to the buy back wallet.  Perhaps they are naming this fund the buyback plan and it is not technically a buyback plan as a ploy to dupe holders?I understand vx’s post regarding the Vechain financial report. It definitely is positive that they are locking up funds that they would have otherwise sold without the buyback plan. But to imply that they were going to buy this vet off the open market is pretty low. We all thought the same thing when the buyback medium was posted. “The information related to the buybacks will be disclosed in VeChain Financial Executive Report, starting from Report Vol.8.” Is the final sentence in the buyback medium.They did not disclose any relevant information in the vol.8 report. Am i the only one seeing this right now?#I’m so glad VeChain isn’t a Marvel movie in the making, because all of us detectives would’ve spoiled it, and then complained about how Marvel was letting us spoil their plot with our sleuthing.  We would be sending tweets to Stan Lee to make a statement because Avengers: Buyback didn’t play out the way we dreamed for it to pan out. We are all Tom Holland.#This seems like the most relatable application of VeChain we know about so far: [https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-partners-with-shanghai-gas-and-enn-to-pilot-blockchain-enabled-liquified-natural-gas-5b6f517b22d9](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-partners-with-shanghai-gas-and-enn-to-pilot-blockchain-enabled-liquified-natural-gas-5b6f517b22d9)It's focused more on the supply chain, tracking, quality control side of things but maybe you can find some parallels.Maybe there is value to tracking and monitoring the first product like the Bright Foods application: [https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-signs-a-partnership-with-bright-foods-and-its-it-tech-subsidiary-shanghai-xiandao-food-to-e4a38b331d41](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-signs-a-partnership-with-bright-foods-and-its-it-tech-subsidiary-shanghai-xiandao-food-to-e4a38b331d41)#Rather than Vechain why not put him in contact with DNVGL. Certification may be more useful and he may be able to utilise their expertise and clientbase.They may be able to confirm its environmental benefits.#Check out  [https://www.vechain.com/product/toolchain](https://www.vechain.com/product/toolchain) U can incorporate Toolchain in those firms#Slap a qr code on the drill bit#Sorry this is just brainstorming without knowing the product or the sector so might not be useful at all.First thing that comes into my mind with the fluids is counterfeit. But I‘m not sure how big of a problem that is for this sector because it‘s very niche. Might not be a relevant use case at all.Then you could try to put the fluid chemistry on the blockchain and figure out which fluid has been used by which company and where based on where it was shipped to. But this could also be done without any blockchain technology at all I guess and not even sure it‘s useful at all to know 😂#They could always use it for marketing.#Can someone eli5 how this doesn’t affect the price? Not complaining, I want it to stay down for a bit so I can dca but I would like to understand how they’re buying large amounts and no price movement.#Totally expected. Everything is going according to the plan#This is really lame#It wasn't bought on the spot, but heck, I am happy it didn't pile on to the already thick sell walls.#Where can you see it & which exchange did the by from?#So over 1 Billion vet are locked in the buyback wallet right ? That’s a lot :)#Pretty LEET if you ask me...#I would think other crypto projects.#Traders trying to make money by manipulating sentiment#In a broader sense, ABC’s new blockchain solution — reportedly called E-Blockchain Loan — will be ideal to resolve the complexity of the loan process.It's not on VeChain.#Security?#Use the vtho calculator on vechainstats.

If so, it's really a ledger and windows issue, vechain cannot fix this. It's happening with MEW also. If you can't find a trusted computer with a different operating system you can try to roll back your version of Windows.  https://youtu.be/N8usuErtgPc#It is indeed made invisible. The mod (SolomonGrundle?) asked nicely to discuss such subjects on the daily to  keep the main page clean. The few responses were: VeChain doesn't aim to be decentralised. The foundation picks who can be an Authority Node. Mining like for BTC (and forks) or ETH can't be done for VeChain.#It wasn’t VeChain related, the main feed is reserved for VeChain related posts. Daily discussion is the place to discuss ideas or non-VeChain topics, hence why I asked OP to relocate it here. I sent them a message before removal to clarify .#How do they know when it was bought?#"" gave them the benefit of the doubt and calculated these prices based on highest daily value ""lol the whole purpose of a buyback is to get as many ""shares"" at the lowest price possible, if anything he should have calculated somewhere between the average and the lowest daily value.#That deadline passed a year ago. The only way to get an x-node is through the wallet auction. Keep in mind that these nodes don't include any VET themselves, you still have to add the minimum requirement yourself.#1m you can ""convert"" it to an strengt node1.6m you can BUY (with extra vet , like 500k vet f.e) a strenght x node. so 1.6+ (in this case) 500k =2.1m for a strenght x node.#No. Only if you buy the X-node status along with it. You can still mature an economic node though.#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

My thing is if they're OK with trying to pull this somewhat shady stuff then what is going to be next?#[removed]#Thank you for the useful links!#They are already in progress with certifications. Not sure if it's done by DNVGL though. I do know that they are backed by two universities that have tested some products as well as a European institute that is well known in the oil and gas sector. I did not talk to him about DNVGL's relationship with Vechain so it might be good to bring up. Thanks (:#I've talked to him about Toolchain but I'm not sure in what way he would really benefit from using it. Perhaps I'm missing something?#Hahaha. I thought about embedding certain parts of the pump/drill with chips to track wearage/maintenance maybe?#lmao#Yea I thought about that as well but since his company will be the only supplier of the fluid for a pretty long time I personally don't see a benefit in proving it's authentic (as buyers would have to purchase it straight from his company). I don't think he would want to put the chemistry of the fluid anywhere near any kind of blockchain since it's a secret formula.#How could it be utilized for marketing?#Wrote explanation here [https://www.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/d9zgqa/daily\_vechain\_discussion\_september\_27\_2019/f1mv8hu/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/d9zgqa/daily_vechain_discussion_september_27_2019/f1mv8hu/?context=3)#I call shenanigans.A purchase like that is double the daily volume of binance.There is no way they've been buying small amounts and just transferred today.There is no way you buy twice the daily volume of the exchange in small amounts and not one trader noticing. It's more likely the hundreds of millions we saw getting transferred to binance has something to do with it.Sunny needs to make a statement about what's going on.#They transferred that much today, but it could have been bought back earlier in small chunks#https://twitter.com/BuyBackBot/status/1178377238439440385?s=19#Yes#Hehe....still love VET, but Ripples effort to grow the ecosystem underneath XRP has just accelerated lately, but VET was up 6pct against XRP today....I had to carpe the hell outta that diem!BTW, Solution: Found that something related to the latest windows 10 update caused the rejection of transaction! I used my girlfriends old PC (with an Ole version og Windows!) to send the VET from veforge to Binance.#Good point. By the looks of it the author has used the dates when the VET was sent to the buyback wallet not when it was actually bought so not completely accurate but does give a rough idea of what has been spent to date.#So in an unregulated market ""the best way to get as many share as possible at the lowest price"" is to firstly force the price down with selling and then buy it back cheaper at the bottom. Ok.. I am with you. But wait..Edit: this was a response to a now deleted comment telling the audience ""the best way to get as many shares as possible at the lowest price"".The writer holds vechain  )#It can be read in multiple ways. It can either mean the value would equate to $5 million if purchased on the open market, or that $5 million would be purchased on the open market. We've all been assuming they meant buying on the open market, but they could mean the other meaning.#Nope, you are correct, that post makes no sense.#It actually does make sense if you dissect the paragraphs in the medium article....“The information related to the buybacks will be disclosed in VeChain Financial Executive Report, starting from Report Vol.8.” Is the final sentence in the buyback medium.They did not disclose any relevant information in the vol.8 report.   Are we all just glancing over this statements as well?A REAL financial report would have disclosed how much vet was bought, on what date and for what price. The buyback purchases should be charted. A real buyback would have this information on the books.  These financial reports aren’t actually financial reports. They do not give you numbers. They are smoke and mirrors documents.Fucking downvote me all you want people but wake the fuck up. The buyback article is written as a hype article.  The financial report doesn’t give you actual numbers but instead gives you highlights of the events the team attended throughout the quarter.#Planchain ICO?#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

I explained it well in my posts#Nah, he really doesn’t.#Do any of you understand how OTC works?#>A purchase like that is double the daily volume of binance.That means it was done in 2 days, at minimum. If it came from binance that is. Very simple.#Thanks.#I’ve been looking into XinFin over Ripple lately.  They are making moves and apparently the XRP community is taking notice.   Idk#I mean I said it over a month ago, the buyback was never intended to increase the price. Not many were sharing the same sentiment as me back then.#Hmmm interesting interpretation#Tell me where it says they are actually going to buy vet in the buyback article? IT NEVER SAYS THEY ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BUY VET.#The best part is that they plan on releasing a mobile app as well (cough Safe Haven cough)#That makes sense! But I do have trouble seeing why I would need blockchain to do that, as in that storing that data on blockchain wouldn't benefit you more then using a centralized server right?#I agree! That's why I'm looking for valid use cases, otherwise I won't even bother him (:#Does any of the things you want to track... Drilling fluid or pump/bit need to be verified outside of the company? I mean if it's internal and only they care about it then probably doesn't need vechain.If it needs to be verified by another agency or someone outside the company then it probably would benefit.As to how it's implemented, you'll want people with explicit knowledge in drilling to get feedback I'd think.#Not a single 50m sell wall affected.It's almost like the people who put those walls up knew that they wouldn't get touched.I'm not a professional trader, but when someone announces a buyback like this, you probably want to protect your coins and remove them for the time being, and yet no one has removed their sell walls.Also buying twice the daily volume is impossible without any one noticing.#[removed]#Buying and selling at the same time doesn't explain the low volume on binance.A 200m vet purchase is more than two days of entire volume on binance. Unless they are literally transferring to binance to just transfer to the buyback wallet.Talk about taking money from one pocket and putting it in the other.I appreciate your effort to explain, but I wanna hear it from sunny.I don't buy whats going on. Not one bit.#Do you understand that asking things like ""do any of you understand how"" something works and then not going on to explain said something makes you look like a know it all without actually showing you know anything but simultaneously casting shade on those who genuinely don't know what the fuck OTC stands for. So Einstein.. explain to all of us noobs how OTC works? In detail please.#Oh and every other trader took 2 days off with zero trading#This buyback is turning into usual shady VeChain territory. Stop allowing staff to sell tokens and stop buying back tokens - if nobody wants to use it and the price flops then this is natural selection of sorts - but this orchestrated buying and selling of ones own coins is just undermining the entire projects integrity.#Some people would prefer getting dumped on for $25 million worth of VET instead. Go figure 🤷🏻‍♂️#Well it will be an aspect of trust with the maintenance data/ ware data on the blockchain it will be available to show that the maintenance is indeed real (trust) and the need for maintenance part is not just for the “money”. So with that data public it can be used in a internal database or if wanted it can stay on the blockchain for the transparency aspect creating a edge over the rest of the competition. So if the data collected by iot devices is used to create stronger drills costumers can also see the positive development of creating stronger products.#From what I understand they deliver fluids to a ''mud supply company'', so they do not use them internal. Before the mud supply company uses a new or different fluid they will do a lot of testing before they use it in a live oil well. They do need to know that the product they use is good of course, but as of today they use fluids from suppliers that have been reliable and have a good reputation, without the need of blockchain verification.#Pretty sure they just transferred it to binance then just to that vet wallet...#Dude, when you don't understand something really just be humble and admit that to yourself.

Since Vechain wants vethor to be relatively cheap/affordable so it can be used by companies and adopted worldwide, I wonder if this means they are also aiming to make sure thor will be stable in terms of pricing.#He pretty much announced it himself.

Or do you mean the buyback already happened? This looks as if someone is transferring funds from Ocean to sell on Binance since Ocean has zero liquidity.#Nice find. One assumption: it‘s a a „funding wallet“ from the foundation. It‘s used to sell VET for fiat needs and is now used as a transfer wallet for the buyback process. The foundation will use this wallet for buying AND selling purposes depending on the short term strategy.Could be something else but if this is not a Foundation wallet, I would be surprised.#The weird thing is they send it out of Binance directly after#Except one of our long term members who lives in China said that products that previously had a QR code don't anymore.

As if they are going to buy it back from themselves? You would think they would buy into the walls, not loading up more vet into Binance. I really have no idea, all very confusing.#Transaction cost need to be low or stable not VTHO#Probably they prefer it to be somewhat stable in price, otherwise they'd have to micromanage the transaction prices.#Vtho price will likely go down.#Yup, a vote could literally be held overnight if a quantum breakthrough was enough of a threat to the ecosystem. What awesome foresight by the VeChain team.#Change is not always a good thing, what if you woke up one day, and the max supply is now 999 billion ?#That was exactly the kind of response I was looking for. You are awesome :)#Dnvgl is tokenizing their certificates, companies need their certificates, they have no choice but to use the wallet#I think this will be something they cannot work around, so they'll have to use it#So two situations:* PoC is done and we are going to scale up* PoC is done, we are not satisfied with the results, so thank you and good luck#Indeed. What a quote that was last week!!#5 million $ at todays price is 1.25 billion VET. That about 2% of VET's circulating supply. Would be devastating if they already bought all VET and price is still tanking. But I don't believe they bought 5 million worth of VET on the open market because we would have seen volume and price spikes on binance. If you look at the official buyback wallet it indicates they have to buy additional 3,5 million$ or 875 million VET this month. We will soon see if they keep their promise. If not, I'd be seriously pissed because I have relied on Vechain doing the buyback and I would have held different coins during recent mini alt season for more gains if I wasn't expecting Vechain to buy a significant amout of VET on the open market.#Feel free to make your own conclusions based on the facts. You can dig even deeper as I did, but I don't want to make a huge longpost. Those facts are curious enough as for me. Someone is surely transferring funds. To sell on Binance. But while there was an attempt from AN to sell Vet through this deposit address, I find it very interesting.There is a reason I left question mark in the end. But now I think that buyback very probably is going to happen soon. And there will be enough liquidity  )#This is a process of funds moving from personal binance deposit address to main Binance hot wallet. It's not going ""out"" from Binance like that. All outs are done from Binance hot wallet.#This scares me. Missed it completely. Who and where did he say this?#I know, I read this too and I do believe he is telling the truth. However I also believe Walmart could simply be tinkering and fine tuning their operations, hence the spikes on test net last week. There may have been some adjustments required from an outside  source eg mushroom supplier could have an issue somewhere along the line. It's really new tech. Teething problems are inevitable. However with the team we have I believe all issues can be overcome.#Because there is no year 2 O 2 0.#2020 is too far in the future#[removed]#[removed]#0.03$ in Jan 2022? This isn’t stock market#$0.03 in 2022?? What a low ball lmao see you at $1#VET will be far more valuable than 0.03 in 2022.#Well, i am in a hard situation rn.I have to move out cuz my current house situation is giving me mental issues.I dont want to cash out all my VET, just the right amount that gives me the possibility to move out.I am living in the Netherlands btw.#Thx!#What you did here, I see it#Ah right. 👍🏻 Thanks#For 800M Vet to be bought someone has to provide enough liquidity, right? Watch the sell walls now on Binance, they are growing bigger, but aren't sold into the market. In the previous cases where I looked at traders/ANs selling, they just market sold and weren't building the walls. That's how it happens most of the time when some entity\\person really want to qiut or make a trade. I think those sell wals are being built for a reason. 53M at 41 sat, 54M at 42 sat. I expect volume to explode soon, while price stay in somewhat reasonable range (but up of course). Let's see how it plays, very interesting week!#It will go up first. Decreasing the amount of vtho cost per transaction is easier to implement. Changing the amount of vtho produced requires a fork which will come after we've first lowered vtho cost per transaction. Both give VET increased value.#Yup this is an essential enterprise factor. This is literally the reason for the governance model.#but i dont see how they will burn vtho for accessing  since vtho burn is only happening if you write data on vet blockchain#Exactly#[removed]#All this stuff is quite exciting. No one in my real life knows apart from my wife and she isn't interested at all, so you guys are all I got lol.#Why are all the ins from ocean ex?#Oh yes, I see. Thanks for the insight.#At the beginning of the last daily, tldr  is basically what I just said, previously tracked products aren't being tracked anymore.#[removed]#Hey vx7777. I'm not sure what you mean?#I'd be very (!) happy with it. That's 750% profit from now and it would equal a valuation of 1,5 billion+ for VET token supply. I'd even take 0.02 in two years (500% profit). I think it's an illusion that there will be a second crypto hype/bubble like 2017. There are thousands of projects now and new money will flow into all these projects which makes it harder for one project to go 5x or 10x in price.#Wow, really? From $0.004 to $1 in 26 months?  I like your style.#Ah, that's a pity dude- I'm sorry to read you are in a bad situation. I am sure if you do cash out some, then you will get an opportunity to buy more sometime down the line. Good times ahead for you and vechain!#Thanks for the reply my man. Still don't understand why they would shift it from ocean ex to Binance. Didn't they just buy it off ocean ex? Why not just transfer it to the buy back wallet from ocean ex? I don't trade so don't have my brain switched into the way of the whale. Its always an interesting week around here 😂 Edit: perhaps a lot of the staff vet becoming unlocked (2 year period) and put on the market to be brought back by the buy back scheme. Nice way to unload all their bonuses without destroying the price even further. Cunning as fuck.#You just answered your own question. Only when new data is uploaded is vtho burnt. Viewing data does not burn vtho. New certifications are given every day for all sorts of things, if uploaded to the blockchain they will burn vtho. Pretty simple. Perhaps even old certificates will be digitised and uploaded, we just don't know.#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Vechain) if you have any questions or concerns.*#haha that sounds so cute xD#I know the pain :)#My assumption: entities tied to foundation now store their Vet in OceanEx custodial solution. So when they decide to use that, they move it from this custodial solution out. Previously they had personal wallets, but this custodial solution should be more convenient to handle and more secure.#We'll see soon enough. For now we can still believe Walmart is finetuning like /u/sevletor describes. I would be devastated if this is not the case though. In that case I will most likely sell....Like many others.#[removed]#I don't want to speak for them, but I think they're trying to say that your expectations for gains relative to your timeline is too conservative, and don't reflect the reality of crypto markets. 2+ years is a long time to see only a 3-5X gains in a bull market. We'll all be left in the dust based on your predictions.#if you are a believer of crypto you will believe  in 2022 bitcoin will be more than 100k $imagine if vechain still sits at 40 sats ( but fuck i damn hope we recover in sats) vet will sit on at least 4 cents. so 3 cents would not make me that happy sorry..#What bubble are you talking about dude? End of 2017 was merely a small poop. The real bubble is yet to come.#This is crypto after all 😋#Thanks m8. Appreciate the nice words.Wish you the best.#Bonuses for staff were never locked up, only management's. Let's not invent narratives, please: ""Nice way to unload all their bonuses without destroying the price even further...""#Well this one is difficult question, maybe they want to influence trading volume exactly on binance. Maybe there is some deal with payment for Binance US going on ( pay with Vet, buy it back with USD(T) ). But that's a far stretched assumption.#[removed]#the problem is everyone just assumes another bull run will occur. Why? When more and more crypto's are exposed for BS vaporware that provides no value and no real world usage, why wouldn't the market actually crash again versus go up#I'm talking about the big, fat, monstrous bubble where token without the smallest sign of proof of concept or a working product had absolutely crazy billion dollar valuations. Like ADA 26 billion, NEM 16 billion, LISK 4 billion etc. Right now interest in crypto-assets is very low compared to 2017 and many people got burnt (that means the narrative of a fancy new asset class that only rises in price does not work anymore). I don't see any signs for a significant growth of crypto assets in the coming years. Some projects will develop and get adopted but that is already priced in to a certain degree. Additionally big tech companies will step in with massive resources and take over a large part of the market if at some point a lot of money can be earned. But that's just my opinion. VET going to 0.01 or 0.02 would be a great return of investment for me. I think it's very unlikely that it will go much higher in price in the future but we'll see and I'd for sure be very happy about it.#Just throwing ideas out there my man. Do you have any ideas as to why 283 million vet has gone from ocean ex to Binance?#[removed]#It might crash again but once real adoption hits then a bubble will form!#Learn cycles#That was not a bubble. That was a small poop. We will see the real bubble in a few years. Right now, crypto is in a state comparable to the Internet in 1994. The big dotcom bubble only came in 2001. That was when regular people and the masses had started USING the internet and expectations totally grew out of proportion. Crypto has yet to reach the masses and we‘re still far away from an adoption level worth talking about. Like, really far away.I understand that what happened can be perceived as a bubble but imagine what a real bubble will look like in 5-7 years when crypto starts to show up everywhere in our lives. We will look back and have a good laugh I guess.#Apologies, I thought you were stating that’s what happened. I’ve seen things like this spiral out of control before, apologies if I jumped the gun. On your Q, I do not. There have a been a few accounts seeing large in/outflows between exchanges. I have no idea what those accounts represent. Possibly bots, or people. Creating intrigue whatever they are!#The only way another huge alt-run/bubble occurs like you say is if crypto/blockchain truly prove real value - meaning massive large scale usage by regular joes (whether they realize they are using it or not). No one is going to be fooled into betting on BS ICO's and $Billion dollar valuations on overhyped vaporware again. That time came and is now 100% gone. Unfortunately outside of maybe a small handul of the 1000+ crypto's (say VET, IOTA, a few others which are still crazy risky and more likely to fail then achieve large scale usage) the vast majority of crypto will prove to be 100% useless. Which actually could lead to another massive crash. Just because most ALT's are down 90-95% doesn't mean they can't easily drop another 95%-100%. So honestly this could really go either way but frankly I'm reallyyyyyy struggling to see where massive crypto adoption for the everyday person is going to come from...#I can only tell you that this is a very pessimistic view based on a nearly 2y bear market. Right now, thousands (!) of very smart people work on blockchain projects. I‘m not talking the shitcoin project people, I‘m talking Fortune 500 IT departments, governments, tech companies with a high reputation and the kind of PWC, Deloitte and so on.There is a MASSIVE industry slowly growing and unfolding step by step. It will take a few year but this will be beyond expectations even for the average crypto investor these days. Not even talking average Joe. Might not even be Bitcoin, might not even be VeChain, but blockchain will be massive in 5-10 years. And it won‘t go away anymore. And yes: 99% of the projects we know will die.#Same thing was said about the internet!"

Going to move it to binance and sell it there.#The price is pinched between two big walls on binance, usually when an entity wants to sell/quit  (like Tictalk guys) or buy they just sell or buy (indeed). This looks like a play here, price is being held like that usually smells distribution or accumulation. Based on the chart it looks like accumulation finally happening here with higher probability. Indeed this could be a smart money play after foundation selling pressure is exhausted. Take this with a grain of salt, it’s just my observation I wanted to share.

Seriously someone just listed a VeThor X Node for 5 Million Vet. Two other VeThor  X this morning were listed for 2 Million and 1 Million VET.I have not seen any X Node sell for over 650,000 VET recently and personally I dont see the slightly extra VTHO generation being worth this much VET.If you buy a VeThor X Node you still need 600,000 VET just to hold it.  Holding 600,000 VET and a VeThor X Node generates 36 VET (270 VTHO)  per day. At that rate it would take you 49 years to generate the 650,000 VET you paid for the node. If you paid 5 Million VET for your node, 380 years to generate it back at the current rate.I understand they can have value in the future but that is still based solely on speculation. Even knowing you can buy a VeThor X and upgrade it through the ranks, these asking prices are getting insane.EDIT: Someone actually bought a VeThor X for 890,000 VET 2 days ago. Given the current market how is this considered a smart investment?#Interesting how on there are little transactions on Oct 1 in the veforge explorer.  This proves that most of the past few weeks volume was from Wal-Mart, because Oct 1 was a Chinese National Holiday.  They are now in their golden week holiday so I think the tx volume should be low these next few days.#Can we have a discussion about the foundation holding more than a quarter VET. I have serious concerns about this in terms of VET price. They are creating enough vtho where companies and businesses can interact directly with the foundation to run their blockchain projects. Not to mention selling tokens to pay employees or for whatever they need Fiat for to run business operations. This goes directly against decentralization. I'm not spreading FUD. I'm just concerned.Instead of down voting, how about a comment and a little back and forth#I would not be here without DNV-GL.  The day they walk out, I'm a gonner too.#I work with DNVGL.

Will the utility of the coin allow it to eventuality break away from bitcoin? Everyone wants to talk about how XRP ran to $3 then crashed back below a $1. I hope in the case of VeChain the Bitcoin bullrun will help it grow exponentially BUT the tokenomics will allow it to retain most of its value and not completely crash one day soon after.   Obviously the most important part is adoption and transactions on Main net. I am excited to see what this brings in the next two years. IF we are lucky the tokenonmics are really kicking it just a the bullrun is starting to send alt coins parabolic.#B)#Yes#Plenty of projects do (or could do) traceability. It is at the simpler end of the implementation spectrum.#The blockchain supply chain market is several trillions, so I think Vechain can deal with a few competitors...cf Amazon/Alibaba or Apple/Microsoft...#Management holds major cardano bags?#I asked the same question a few days ago, didn't even know Cardano was usable yet 🤔🤔🤔#It's blockchain and authentication is a slam dunk use case for blockchain.

I would imagine selling from existing investors is also at near all time low, as basically no-one except those that got in at ICO can sell at a profit here and in USD probably 99% of retail investors are currently at a loss. Those that got in at ICO probably already cashed out ages ago anyways and made millions. So we're stuck with whatever moves the foundation or huge whales (like partners, or other projects on VET) decide to do for now besides some active traders, until there's another increase in general interest (like good, or bad, news or a general bullrun).#It's related to Bitcoin#Good god no#Well from a governance perspective I think we can say that for decisions like tradable x-nodes and major buybacks, the foundation does consider these topics ones where the community should vote upon. That is insightful IMO.#[deleted]#It all depends on how much vet you (plan to) own.#[deleted]#[deleted]#Walmart isn't the only client in China#Most clients at this point are probably operating in China. It just often doesn't intuitively occur to us because in terms of PR, marketing, community management, VeChain is more focused on Western audiences.#Just 4 days ago in your post history you said companies shouldn't purchase VTHO from investors as it's not good for cost. Make up your mind#Naturally, when they created VET they held a bigger portion of the total supply. As time goes by, more and more are released in to circulation. This is natural progression. There are various funds they would hold on to, like the VTHO bonus pools and the enterprise pool that will take much longer to enter circulation but that’s not a bad thing. In the case of the bonus pools, possibly never, I’m sure you don’t lament them holding 12.5B VET for that purpose? Ultimately, the tokens they’ll own are the ones they buy back. This is essentially a new age business model where the tokens are initially used for funding. It’s analogous to a crowd funded IPO, instead of only having high net worth companies and accredited investors invest. They also have to wait for a few years of their funding to elapse before they usually reap the reward via a valuable business, this isn’t really that different in that sense. VeChain needs a few years of runway to establish itself as a viable business.They hold about 25% of VET and shrinking every quarter. The VTHO this produces soon won’t be able to sate daily VTHO demands. No where close. As more projects start coming online and they have an increasingly small portion (hence the buyback) you’ll see increasing market VTHO activity (and we’ve already seen large sums being sent from OceanEx to smart contracts so we know they’re already buying from the open market). You’ve no need to be concerned, this was all stated in the whitepaper - 2018 and 2019 would be almost entirely self funded from ICO funds. When they have operational income (as they do now and increasingly so in the next few years) they won’t need to fund themselves this way. The project becomes increasingly decentralised (from a token perspective, not in terms of actual blockproducers) as time goes by as a proxy of this release. Time is a key factor to achieve that goal.#you guys are a special kind of something. first some ""investors"" of this sub are whining about the foundation is not  gonna buy back as told. and afterwards some are crying the foundation owns too much of the tokens. give me a break.#Under the assumption that enough clients never create enough transactions to burn enough VTHO to bring value to VET, yes that would obviously be a problem. But I don’t see how that has to do with however big Vechain’s stack is. We’ll all lose if that’s the case it’s not like screwing over other VET holders is their key to success#Almost every coin has this problem . I hope that vet being in the foundations hands is better than some random btc whale holding it Same with ripple where they hold over 50% of the supply , it will be smaller over time but we need patience#One entity can acquire all of the coins if they wanted to and sellers were willing to part with them. This doesn’t go against “decentralization”. Learn what that term really means in regards to cryptocurrencies.#We are in the early stages. Ofcourse they generate enough VTHO to cover most days' usage at this point. Also look into the governance. Vechain foundation is not Vechain.#This has been my biggest concern for a long time now, I’m fairly confident even at this stage the foundation could run things single handily with a couple small tweaks here and there.I can’t begin to image the vtho they have stockpiled up considering the amount of Vet they have staked. Enough to last a lifetime 😂I don’t know how to alleviate my concerns, so the best I can do is hope that the foundation doesn’t “screw” everyone over 😜#That's big praise indeed. Of course there could be a scenario where the scope and volume on the vechain network is so colossal you would be unable to tell if they have left or not...#I work in maritime and all my certifications are stamped by DNV GL#Ah! Thank you for the timeline. Much appreciated.#Why would hyperledger tweet today, about a project that is 3 years old#[deleted]#Hyper ledger isn’t a direct competitor.  It is basically a Blockchain-as-Service.  So you setup and program a blockchain to do whatever you want#They specifically point out hyperledger being used to trace pork sold in Walmart China. Not looking too good. The only part of this article that gave me hope that VeChain is still in the mix was this line: “For example, in building a truly open system, the Walmart team worried about interoperability with other blockchain-based traceability systems.”#You're right, I have a roof over my head and food on my plate, I'll always be grateful for that. Just hurts to sell at a significant loss.#Thanks Solomon, hands down you're one of my favourite admins on reddit, completely neutral and not biased. Keep doing what you're doing! I look forward to seeing you in here some time next year :)#It's a basic X node, I've put it on the market hopefully it sells within the next few days.#yet.#A bitcoin run may have no bearing on vet price. We may even go down. Token economics- possible. That's the one I'd choose led by DNV GL, Delloite, Walmart (PWC) and of course BYD. Those 4 beasts can burn us 50 million VTHO daily between them when they peak.#Can’t wait for a bull run then ! And yes I agree , almost nobody is in profit , there can’t be that many people left in the market#good comment!#[removed]#I have done the math to determine the additional VTHO produced by each level of Economic and X node. The VeThor X is one of the worst performing in this area. If I were to move to X Node I would purchase enough VET to buy the node and also be able to upgrade it to a Strength X. I understand future value is speculation and generation rates can change but I think we are to early for X Nodes to be priced this high.  It looks like 600,000 (or more) VET to buy any X Node. If VET makes it to a $1.00 is that X Node worth $600,000 to someone?#Yeah, that's not how it works chief.It only shows interest if they actually get sold for those inflated amounts, which just doesn't happen.Also, calling someone who is merely stating some facts a 'wah baby' is completely unnecessary.#Keep the replies constructive please. He is just making a solid statement. Or maybe you're the buyer of 890k he's referring to? Anyways.. no need to act so patronizing.#He is just sharing an opinion based on maths, no need to be salty.#Thank you for the detailed and thorough response. Much appreciated#[deleted]#According to VeChain stats the current VTHO pool across the entire VeChain Ecosystem is 15.8 billion. Yes we are still generating significantly more than we burn daily. But the long term thought it eventually all these major clients will launch and ramp up on the main net (hopefully over the next 1-3 years). Then we will start to burn more than the generation and some of the stockpile of VTHO. However it is still a good idea to have a large stockpile of VTHO available to attract new clients. If I am a major company why would I want to partner with a blockchain that is going to run out of gas or have a limited supply of gas? This would be alarming to me and cause concern about long term stability of the project. You guys worry to much sometimes. We are still at least 2 years early to seeing VeChain up and running at full speed. Sunny said 2021 is the year of mass adoption.#Based on latest financial report foundation only hold about 23B VET and 15B out of 23B is allocated for Nodes pool. And remaining 8B is allocated for Investors pool. From this perspective they do not own much left.Edit: with first 5m usd they bought back about 1B with remaining 20m usd they probably able to buy back another 4B  VET assuming average price remains the same until june 2020.Also if the biggest stakeholders in the ecosystem is bullish (accumulating VET) that is actually a positive sign. This action alone should already stopping anyone selling their holdings. But in crypto most of the time it defying logic (economic fundamentals)#Look into the governance.#This is my concern as well. If there's no demand for vtho, Vechain can just sell their stockpiles to their clients. Every day that passes there's millions more vtho created, and with no large clients being onboarded, the stockpile grows. For every supposed ""FUDer"" that posts here, there's several more  that have the same worries.#Because it's news.#Please stop spreading misinformation.#[deleted]#[deleted]#Walmart China Blockchain Traceability Platform is built on VeChain, and will be powered by VeChain.

It’s how every public blockchain works. Without a central organiser, there needs to be a financial incentive to run the hardware and bare the costs of supporting the network. Every blockchain does this.

I am unsure as i am somewhat new to the field myself. I go back and fourth between GitMeister/Server administrator and coding. I have the ""title"" of software engineer.

That would probably classify as programming.#You are Data (Pipeline) Engineer#My title is ""Senior Programmer/Analyst."" It has been for 17 years.

This reddit HATES that fact though, and likes to insist that CS *by definition* means programming, despite literally decades of evidence to the contrary. ""Software Engineer"" is a made up term by non-engineers to mean computer professionals. It can mean dozens of different subsets of CS, including programming. Lots of SQA people are called ""Software Engineers"" (or ""Software Quality Engineers""). Big Data guys are called software engineers even though they rarely if ever program. You have to remember that most of these titles are completely meaningless and made up. There's literally no such thing as a real software engineer. You will find ZERO ""software engineers"" who are P.E.'s (Professional Engineers). Use whatever title you think will help you get your next job#you sound like a data analyst more than a SWE, but the title really doesn't matter, does it?#where can i get a job like this? i prefer this over writing code#Know of any similar positions in Philly?#So many people saying the title doesn't matter, and as an individual I would agree that it does not. But what happens when OP looks for a job that suits his experience (Data Analyst experience) however the HR person flipping through resumes doesn't see ""Data Analyst"" on his/her resume and instead sees ""Software Engineer""? Often times it is HR doing the initial filtering, and you can bet they don't read the bullet points. They read the job titles to match to the job description requirement, for example: ""5+ years of data analyst experience""#well SQL is code to me, and some problems are even more interesting than mainstream application code :)#I do the same thing as you and my job title is Data Architect/Scientist. I write a bit of sql, python and java at work. Most is for data flows or transformations. However, most of my time at work is spent doing implementions/tests/NiFi workflows/analyzing data. If I write code, it's mostly to make my life a bit easier or make the environment more maintainable. Such as writing storm toplogies to dynamically replace data based on a key value in a database rather than hardcoding a replace statement.I write code mostly in my free time on OS projects such as lucene or NiFi.#if it fits on a spreadsheet, it ain't big data#I think your correct title is either Database Developer, borderline Data Engineer (if you mentioned using more python I'd call you a Data Engineer). They covered their rear ends by hiring a full SWE to do the job.#I work with SQL and also customize existing java code and write little pieces to build small elements on top of the core software . However, I have never had to create code from scratch. For example, I never have to declare any variables. They are all pre-made by 'higher' engineers. I can only reference them within the confines of what the engineers have have deemed safe for customization.#People over-index on titles.#I've learned to shrug off titles unless I find them detrimental to future resumes. *A rose by any other name...*#Everyone here saying that data analyst might be a better title fit, but unless you're actually pulling and analyzing said data, sounds more like a Data Warehouse Manager position.#BI Developer, not Software Engineer#Well today I wrote 15 lines if we include CSS, then I was in meeting or trolled in blind and reddit so... But I am getting a 15% raise this month anyway :D#Unfortunately this is quite common in the bigger companies.

I write code all day long. It’s mostly SQL.

Delete this or make it a lot less obvious.Edit 2: Just read through your comments on this post and it definitely is. PM me if you need confirmation.#+1. Perhaps your title should be data analyst. Most of the interviews are algorithm and design based so as long as you know them you will be fine. But make sure that when you talk about experience it comes as you write code as well. I am almost sure that if you say that you work only on sql then lots of recruiters/hiring managers will have reservations.#[deleted]#This is one field where most of the titles don't correlate with the job functions. I frequently see LinkedIn profiles where the person has a title of ""Server Administrator,"" for example, but their listed daily duties include things like: developing mobile apps with react native, provide on-call product support to clients, front end design with HTML/CSS, etc. I have also seen Data Analysts that don't do any data analysis lol.#[deleted]#It really only matters very much when you are trying to get another job and people who aren't familiar with what you do are trying to figure it out.

I need to know more about the environment and whether they offer relocation though#And when the background check turns up a title of just SWE?#I was telling a joke#TLDR focusing too much on one data point in a large system, leading to invalid conclusions because they're overly worried about a specific feature of the data.#[deleted]#[deleted]#You gotta post that role then so he can call himself a data engineer#That's a good idea.

Learn one language really well and understand it and help build your knowledge of computers via that language. Understanding how computers function in general will allow you to apply concepts in any language. This is because no matter how well you know a language, any job you go into will place you into a situation where you will learn new things. How well you understand the underlying concepts will determine how you face adversity.In my opinion, just knowing how to program doesn't mean shit.

Yes, i would look into some interviewing books and work on my confidence.And I have already started learning python in more depth and write some programs.. I will just be implementing some existing data workflow/pipeline at work which are currently implemented in other technologies.

I have used it primarily to migration existing ETL processes. You can also implement your own processors in Java.#Will check it out, i have heard and read about it a little."

Happy friday, hope you got a dayjob and paycheck today#Happy Friday to all#Whoa.... what happened with that flash drop in price to 379 on oceanex? (Wish I had set my buy order waaaay lower)#I apologize if this is a long comment but if anyone can help me with the strength node, I would really appreciate it.I recently accumulated enough VET for a strength node. I will wait the 10 day maturity period, but I have a question for what to do afterwards.I can simply press upgrade to a Strength Node and I am enrolled for the rewards? What if I wanted to sell some VET (I am a long-term holder. Just want to clarify.)? Then will my node automatically go away? I don't know much about this so I just want to ensure my VET won't disappear randomly.Also... I think I read somewhere that the rewards you have to collect manually. If that is the case, can I collect over a long period of time? Let's say I go 1 month without collecting anything. Then will all the VTHO accumulate for the month and I could claim it in full?I tried to do the proper research, but I am still a little bit confused. Thank you for all the help.#Hi!I keep reading about the Chinese holidays as explanation of the main net transactions dropping. As far as I can see the big stores like Walmart are still open during the holidays. I assume it would actually be more busy than usual. So to me it seems a bit strange, and I'm really curious if it's really the holidays or if there's another good explanation. Not trying to fud, I'm genuinely curious and I hope the transactions will be back in full force next week 🙂#I haven’t been here in quite some time. What’s up with the mainnet regression?#You 2 Vtho x node sellers can keep going down 1k at a time if you want. Nobody legit will buy until 600 or below.

Implementation and licensing of a professional chart engine is costly. Please give Fabian some time and also don't forget to tip him.#I was thinking something similar to this yesterday. I want to find a way to export the transaction data from Veforge explorer into a spreadsheet.  Then I can filter and sort by wallet address, date, ect. I think I might have stumbled on a big business wallet but I want to be able to see/filter all the transactions to help verify it.#Yes! I’ve thought of doing a spreadsheet and figured someone has had to been keeping track#Several times it was asked to Fabian.  Nothing so far.  It is a fact though that, as time passes, the monthly transactions are insightful enough.  Even though I would like to snoop into historic daily differences also, it might be considered less and less important.#VetCast is awesome!#What do you think is happening?#Might as well expand on this, you've hinted towards something greater going on in a few of your posts. Plus we're bored lol.Either way, greatly appreciate your analysis of these movements.#Nice open loop.#Someone is about to dump coins on Binance? How do I make money on this... by getting ready to buy cheap tokens on Binance and sell expensive tokens on OceanEx?#Without a stable coin a lot of businesses wont touch crypto.  They need to settle to something close to whatever currency they do most of their business in.   If I took out a loan in USD for $1 million so that I could buy something I could sell for $2 million... I dont want to setup that deal, get paid in crypto,  and then by the time I convert back to USD watch the market tank and my profits with it.#I don't get it#Vechain is the joke. I am the punchline.#Thanks, buddy! I actually just received my first paycheck ever today. Great to enter the working world after years of schooling. Cheers!#Happy Chinese holiday#Same, mine got filled but it wasn't as low as I was thinking. haha#Also big spike of volume on binance right now.#I just gained enough for a node as well, 9 days ago :)You do not wait 10 days and then request the upgrade  You request the upgrade when you hold enough VET, and only then the 10 day period starts. Should you sell VET so your account goes below 1M VET then yes, the node goes away. As far as I could see, you do not need to claim manually. You can if you want, but the rewards are paid out automatically every monday.Mind you, this is what I have found out reading stuff (mainly here). I could be wrong as my node has not matured just yet (1 more day...yeeh! :) )#Simple Steps to get your first Strength Node: (The way I would do it)1. Purchase or acquire 1 Million VET and store it in the VeForge Wallet using a Ledger or similar hardware (Safe Storage).2. Download the VeChain Thor app on your mobile phone and set it up to **observe** your VeForge wallet. You can see your wallet but none of it is tied directly to the mobile phone.3. Once the app is Synced to your VeForge wallet and it sees it has 1 Million VET, go to the rewards tab in the app and hit upgrade. The countdown of 10 days will start.4. After 10 days the node will be placed in you VeForge wallet. You should see the word ""Strength"" in the node column in the Veforge Explorer.5. The initial 1 Million VET will generate VTHO in real time in your VeForge Wallet. The bonus VTHO from the node will generate in the mobile app under the rewards tab. They show up as ""bubbles"". You have  to manually collect the reward whenever you feel like it. Every day, week, month, year, its completely up to you. Once you collect it, it cost 100 VTHO of the reward to move it to your wallet and will be there within 4 hours.The 1 Million VET and Strength node should generate about 523 VTHO a day. 432 directly into the VeForge Wallet and about 91 VTHO from Node bonus that generates in the mobile app.If you ever fall below 1 Million VET the node is gone. If you get up to 5 Million VET you can upgrade it to a Thunder which takes several days (more than 10)#First, rest assured that no VET will ever « randomly disappear » from your wallet. The (economic) strength node status is free, you only lose it if you revoke it or if your wallet amount drops under 1 million VET. You can regain it for free once you get back over 1 million again, it will be the same process and maturity period as the first time.The Vthor you will have collected in the meantime just piles up, you’re free to claim and do whatever you want with them anytime.Economic nodes are basically worry-free : )#Selling VET and falling under the minimum amount, you will only lose the node, no VET will disappear.You can claim whenever you want.  Every hour, day, week, month, year or (hopefully) decade.#The thought currently is that walmart pulled the codes while they restructure them. This isn't anything unusual, they ran them for a time and have more of an idea on how they want to utilize them.  The current thought is they're going to be rerolling them out at the end of the month.As to why transactions slowed down this week during chinese holiday MY thinking is that the regular transactions aren't actually walmart. I believe those have stopped for some time until they reroll out their codes. My thinking is that someone besides walmart who's been doing the majority of the transactions or a few people are chinese companies that are down this week during holiday and that's why things have dropped off this week.But hey, at least it's not out of the blue, this was kind of expected.#Chinese holiday#Love to start every daily thread the same way this week.#Average sale price is 620k. Median 600k. I agree there are a lot of silly prices. Like the ones selling for the amount of VET needed to keep, hoping to confuse poor folks. Remember We control supply though so if you're the only person selling, why not ask more than 650+ ? It's a perfectly fine capitalistic opportunity.#Looks like a functioning market to me. All good.#Since when has dealing with bad people ever stopped companies from making a few bucks? Especially with such a big player like China.#Concerned no, China was one of the reasons i picked Vechain because China is pretty big by itself#The rest of the world has no choice in this matter.#Vechain is Singapore based I thought#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

You were sleeping.#umm lets see an entire VET supply of 86.71 billion and you want to see a value of $100 per VET token. That means total market cap (value of the company) would be 8.67 **Trillion** dollars. Basically VeChain would have to be worth **8.6** times the value of companies like Microsoft (MC 1.05 Trillion), Apple (MC 1.02 Trillion) , and Amazon (MC 856 Billion). You could be waiting a while.........................#Why use a licensed professional chart engine, when there are al lot of good open source “chart engines” ?#I would love to be able to export all data from for example 1 wallet to a spreadsheet. I don't have the skills to build something like that :(#“A big play”#Vechain isn't moving, is joke.#he means the price of vet is not going up or down so its stable... (pssst its a joke, he means vet is the stable coin)#What a movie , huh#Welcome to the ranks of the ungainfully employed..#Good luck in your career and so now if we drop you can cheer and buy more#Buy more VET and BTC!#So last week‘s drop was just Chinese cashing out for their holidays right? 😎#Basic vtho generation is distributed passively, so no need to claim. VTHO generated as node bonus must be claimed manually.#[removed]#[removed]#[deleted]#[removed]#[removed]#That would make more sense! Thanks for your reply.I just hope Walmart will be back again since it's such a great partner to have.#I agree with John Crypto here.One thing to add: listen to the latest Vetcast podcast in which Ben and Fabian discuss this topic as well.#I thought you were dropping the classic meme on me.But it is, in fact, a Chinese holiday. Wouldja look at that.#I totally agree. It was mostly in jest because the two sellers keep undercutting each other every 10min or so. it's all good :)#Are you may be correct, at which point it largely makes my initial comment irrelevant.#As a follow up I realistically think a **stable** marketcap of 250 Billion is possible one day and would be a home run for VeChain. That would put it along the same value as companies like Verizon, Mastercard, Intel, Cisco.At 250 billion MC each VET token would be worth about $2.90.This is strictly my opinion and has no real facts to support it. Just an observation. You have to remember Crypto markets can explode and we could see a huge MC for VeChain one day but it can disappear as fast as it came, That is why I mentioned **stable** market cap above.#Just to add some clarity beyond this... it took companies like Microsoft (whom created a life changing invention) over 20 years to reach 1T dollar valuation. The entire crypto market may reach trillions some day, and BTC may reach 1T Mcap one day... but the likelihood of 99% of other crypto’s is nigh on impossible.#Good question. I think Fabian is considering all options. However, knowing him he aims for the best. Let's see what he comes up with.BTW he did some great updates to Wallu couple days ago.#[deleted]#This is my thought as well. I am currently working on a way to do it.#Oh boy that sailed over me lol#Look at livecoinwatch then Vechain .

The additional 600,000 VET and Strength X node generates 55% more ""rewards"" than the 1million VET and a regular Strength node.#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

But unfortunately at this time nobody knows Vechain if they did “bad publicity is better than no publicity”.. And if we can spot chinese counterfeits, I think that’s a win anyways#I think the top enterprise blockchain has a good chance of hitting 1T in time (decade or two)#I hope to see some other coins such as VET break away from BTC. Hopefully the utility of VET allows it to runs its own course of value. BTC is simply a store of value, unfortunately as it moves it generally takes all the other coins with it.#That's a good point, but we still have no idea how to value a crypto network. As of now, they mostly only provide speculative value. But when they actually start having utility, they might start seeing value from network effects that Microsoft could never even imagine.  In the future, just being a network that allows seven billion people to transfer value to each other might be worth a trillion dollars.  It would make more sense to compare Bitcoin to the worldwide USD cash market at that point. Trillions.And since Ethereum likes to brand itself as programmable money, you could argue it is more akin to HTTP than it is to Microsoft. What's the value of HTTP? That's like asking what the value of the internet is.  Tens of trillions?And with VeChain, we can have the internet of authenticity, the internet of trust. How much would that be worth? Hundreds of trillions? Think about it. The world runs on trust. Lack of trust is the single biggest source of friction in any business transaction, at every scale. Super markets provide me what I need to live, food, based on the trust that my credit card company will reimburse them for the food. If they didn't trust credit card companies, I'd have to rely on checks. If they didn't trust banks, I'd have to rely on USD bills. If they didn't trust the government, I'd have to bring in gold coins. If they didn't trust the gold was real, they'd have to keep a jeweller on site to check the coins. Imagine how slow business would operate if we had to wait on verifying on transfer of value. That trust is valuable to businesses. That trust is so valuable that they are willing to pay 2% on every purchase to the credit card company, just for the promise that they will get their money.Now, imagine if that transfer of value happened automatically when certain conditions were met. No more energy, thought, or laws would have to be put in place to prevent cases where someone was trying to defraud someone else. If you say you're good for the money, then I can be sure that you are. If you say that these shrimp never went above freezing, then I can be sure that you're telling the truth. How much is a network worth that can prove someone is telling the truth? To me, that sounds like omniscience. How much is omniscience worth?#[removed]#[chartjs](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/master/README.md)  for example, but there are others out there, one Google Search away 🙂#So this is good because eventually it will decouple from BTC movements all together?#[deleted]#Infrastructure week?Might be getting my memes crossed.#You're thinking way too small man. We can't compare blockchain networks to companies. They're more akin to protocol networks like HTTP, SMS, and smtp. How much is the internet worth? How much is email worth? How much is texting worth?#So $100 in the next few years got it#Your comment was automatically removed as it did not meet our minimum karma requirements.

Audited and approved. It will continue to go on for a while, until this pool is depleted.&#x200B Basically, where the supply comes from in crypto? In BTC and ETH ecosystem it is miners mining new blocks, getting rewards and selling that on market.In case of Vet it is foundation selling premined Vet to fund ongoing operations, research and so on.Btc inflation rate is 3.73% yearly now, ETH is about 4.4%Why BTC shoots up every time during the halving event? Because basically **inflation rate is cut in half thus limiting the future supply**.(sidenote: that's why Algorand and Hashgraph are going through the floor, their inflation rate is insane,50%+, Zcash: 34%)&#x200B When foundation sold about 1 billion Vet per quarter, it was generating approximately 1\*4/62\*100 = **6.4% yearly inflation**, (where 62 bil is approximate circulating supply)&#x200B **Supply and demand dynamics is key for the price**With the help of buyback program, effective current **inflation should become about zero, at least for the year**.**I think of that as very positive and bullish sign from now on.**#>Just want to emphasize how legitimate and credible VeChain now is - Board of Directors for trusted blockchains in China with the big boys, Alibaba, Huawei, Tencent, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange 😳 VeChain must be doing something right!https://twitter.com/BenYorke/status/1177635369166073858#“Top of the list” of “The Board of Directors”. I’m sorry whattttttttttttttt!!!! Are we witnessing the birth of the next: SoftBank: https://youtu.be/YgkQdUB0JVQTencent: https://youtu.be/m5yFhJFqw5wAlibaba: https://youtu.be/gk69hV6LEgI?? ?#The VeChain Executive Financial Report vol.8, which covers the period of May 2019 to July 2019, is now available!https://medium.com/vechain-foundation/vechain-financial-executive-report-vol-8-f9a8ef88b5d9#> Announcing Beta Mainnet Launch![https://medium.com/plairlife/announcing-beta-mainnet-launch-1a608d3e8b14](https://medium.com/plairlife/announcing-beta-mainnet-launch-1a608d3e8b14)#Now, when I've talked a little bit about supply question, there is the other one important: demand&#x200B Where the demand for BTC came from? Initially, it came from... yeah, black markets. You know, Silk Road and so on.BTC had important qualities: anonymous, transparent, fast, non-repudiable, high portabilityThis where the organic demand came from. When it started gaining value, speculators kicked in.Spectacular rise, crash in 2013, then finding a bottom. Every speculation comes back from where is started until there is a real demand for an asset.You know, Bitconnect spiked and then crashed and never recovered, because there was nothing except speculative demand.In 2015-2016 Bitcoin found the bottom and started rising when organic demand  (store of value for people whose currencies are overinflating like Argentinian, so on) for BTC started outweighing the supply. Then another speculative bubble kicked in 2017. Now BTC is again trying to find that organic demand and is doing pretty well.I won't talk long about ETH story, but basically the demand for ETH came from when ICO funding started to gain interest and traction as new technology, smart contracts, so on...&#x200B Now, where the organic demand for Vet should come from. This is pretty simple - demand for VET comes from demand for VTHO. And demand for VTHO comes from transactions on mainnet. So key here is big dapps running on vechain thor. Getting as much VTHO burned as being generated. Then simple laws on supply-demand kicks in. **Speculating on future usage is fun, but you can live on news and partnerships for that long, in the end, we need that real usage**. As we know, team is working hard on that, so we wait for that to happen. When? Who knows. Then, speculative demand will follow again... and you know how hard speculative demand kicks in in crypto. Stay tuned.#starting to put more weight on the ""we're (too) early"" sentiment as a reason for why we don't see major buying pressure from big $$$ players, even though we know that plenty of people with resources have knowledge of this project and the potential.they calculated the timeline better and realize there's still a lot of VET to be released (downward pressure on price) and time before mainnet buildup (slow tokenomics) so their money is better parked somewhere else for now. there's also considerable chance of capital loss in the short to medium term (overall market and VeChain) even if it seems like such a sure thing to those of us who believe strongly in the project.focus on Medium articles and the partnership network, not the price. soon enough though.#I'm in a super good mood today and just want to pass it on. I know these are rough times, but I will do my part in lifting the price today, just to all make you feel better. Now, I don't know how big that 60k VET will impact the market, but I'm already preparing an email to announce to CMC that they should reduce the circulating supply by another 60k. VET by VET the supply will dry up, just you watch  )#Just did a quick analysis of the buyback progress (LINK BELOW). I only considered the transactions of 1 Million VET or more into the buyback wallet. There are some very small deposits left out. This table includes 700 Million worth of deposits. The Price Paid highlighted in grey is verified by the @BuyBackBot twitter.Price End of Day (EOD) was sourced from Coin Geicko  and is a good estimate of what the foundation paid during each transaction on the given date.I see a total of **$2.9 Million spent so far out of the $5 million** outlined by the foundation. If these numbers are remotely correct we still need to purchase about $2 million worth of VET by Monday.  That is about another 600 Million VET tokens @ $0.0033 each.Second verification to this is using the avg price paid $0.004195 (highlighted in blue) \* the 700 Million VET currently in the wallet is about $2.9 Million dollars spent so far.  Which agrees with the summation of the $ per transaction above.Thoughts? I looked at this for a while and believe it to be correct. Could be an interesting next 3 days.

I know it's not much, but its something.#Can someone knowledgeable explain - will the funding of Foundation's operational costs by selling VET on the open market continue ""forever""?Or there are some exact timeframes/limitations? Will this supply dry up with time?Do we know how much Foundation is selling in terms of VET/month or USD/month?#edit: Removed as I'm a complete idiot :)#Is anybody keeping track of the $$ amount spent on the buyback so far? I know the foundation is supposed to buy $5Million worth by the end of the quarter.  As of now the wallet has 700Million VET valued at $2.3 Million. On July 1st the VET price was  $0.0081 and now it is $0.0032. This is a big range to be buying at through the quarter. The average price though the quarter would be $0.0056. If we assume it was all bought at avg price then $5million would buy 884 Million VET. However, I know the foundation has added alot in the last week at a cheaper price, meaning more bought below average price. Anyway seems we maybe close to $5million spent this quarter. Just trying to see if anyone has more exact number. I guess if I really wanted to I can go line by line on the deposits to the Buyback wallet and calculate price depending on amount bought and the date it was bought. Then just added them all up to get a total $$$ value spent this quarter. I have a feeling we are at or very close to the $5million being all spent.#This just isn't a bull run at all.#[deleted]#I'm so intrigued as to where we are going with this project in 24 months. I wonder what we will have achieved by 28th September 2021. I wonder what anyone else thinks we can do in 2 years?#[removed]#[removed]#Has the Foundation ever addressed why there is no accounting of the 5 bil VET X Node pool in the Financial Reports?This has been brought up in the past and the fact that it's not in the report seems to suggest that the X Node pool is NOT forever as most people think.Feel bad for everyone who bought into the X Node program.

Such an awesome milestone. Now I can use my PLA. Probably lose them in the process, but hey, I like gaming so why not 😄#Flamethrowing VTHO is certainly key. Both utility and speculation like no other for the win#Problem is that the demand for vtho can be entirely provided by the foundation, and can be for a long time to come.There won't be any real demand for a very long time to come, until the foundation is unable to provide enough of the vtho, which means mainnet is burning much more than daily generation.#I mean it's pretty obvious it's very early still, vechain themselves doesn't expect real blockchain commercialization until around 2022#I've been saying this since early 2018, undeterred by the dozens of stupid downvotes: This is going to take YEARS to come to fruition. It's not magic. Anyone who has taken the time to review the fundamentals should be sitting back comfortably, hopeful and confident that VeChain will relentlessly pursue its goals and remain faithful to its vision, and cognizant that his/her investment may also go to 0 for a million reasons that are beyond VeChain's control. Nothing else matters.#Literally as I posted this, another 589 VET were deposited into the buyback wallet. Seems weird considering it is 3 AM Saturday morning in China right now. I haven't really seen them buy at this time of day. Generally they buy through middle of the night/early morning US time.#My thoughts, they won’t make it.#Sarah seems so fun and genuine  love it!# #### VeChain becomes part of the Board of Directors to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology list of Trusted Blockchains&#x200B &#x200B Big if true! No?#Also non executive reward VET that is not being locked up is being reported as of vol7. No mention of the lockup outside of exec team before that#Occam’s razor would assume, as with all quarters before where large numbers of VET were used for ongoing operations, that they were indeed used for operations. The simplest answer is the most likely. You are insinuating something is true without evidence so it would be I who would be correct in using Occam’s Razor in this exchange. Yours is not the most simple answer. And you really think they released that much VET, just to build some sell walls? That seems more unlikely to me.#Please don’t start making unfounded accusations. We’ve seen how quickly a single comment can get a foothold from a seemingly throwaway about Walmart. You don’t know what you are claiming is true so please don’t imply that it is. I enjoy your factual posts, let’s keep it that way. In the last report they used over 900million VET from the same pool, for example.#Source?#It will dry up with time, there is 6 974 187 078 Vet left in ""ongoing operation and technological development"" fund.We know how much  Foundation is selling in terms of VET/quarter, every Executive report shows that.Basically learning those numbers and doing calculations = doing fundamental analysis. You can take all executive reports, sum the spendings, divide by twelve and find out how much they spend monthly on average.  You can even calculate average monthly price for vet and find very accurate USD estimates. Watching youtube videos from the influencers is not fundamental analysis, but many people think it is.#Have you seen the second transaction page?

People forget the MA Vechain had that put us around $.0075USD, shortly before as high as 140 sats around time leading up to the buyback announcement. Painful to remember how far we’ve come, but buyback is potentially complete#Yeah, I highly doubt it’s going to read $5Million in the address before the end of the month. The medium article states “market value” and as that’s been at random times throughout the month, as you rightly note, that likely means the final value will show less than $5M. I’ve not seen anyone keeping check the way you describe, but I don’t doubt VeChain have been. I would also suspect we aren’t far off hitting the $5M.Edit: not saying they won’t have bought$5M worth,just that it likely won’t be worth $5M due to recent events#You mixed the numbers a bit.If you want to calculate how much the  ongoing operations fund will last, you should take not the total increase in circulating supply, which also includes funds form other pools, Enterprise Investor Pool, Co-Founder Pool, Business Development Pool, but just the Ongoing Operations pool.April 30 2019: 7 771 390 706July 30 2019:  6 974 187 078so the spending for ongoing operations in last quarter:  797 203 628, divide by 3,  265 734 542 monthly6 974 187 078 /  265 734 542 = 26.2 months roughly&#x200B What is curious also, ""Co-founder and development team"" fund should run dry in less than 2 quarters from now.

It's right there#[deleted]#Just re-read all the financial reports again. The only note I can find which can shed some light is this one, from the Financial Report Vol 6:&#x200B >Economic Nodes Reward Pool Change — as stipulated in the whitepaper section 3.6, the VTHO reward pool for economic nodes reduces by 2.5 billion VET every six months from the start of node monitoring (i.e. Sept 1 2018). The first reduction occurred at noon UTC+8, March 1, 2019 and returned to the Foundation’s reserved pool for business development, operations and R&D.There was no change though on the Ongoing Operation and Technological Development category, they didn't add those 2,5bn tokens to this category so.. yeah, it's all mixed up together. By the latest financial report (Vol 8) the Economic Pool should still have 12,5bn tokens and the X one 5bn so a total of 17.5bn. The Foundation controlled approx 22bn tokens adding up Operation, EIP & Business dev. So the VTHO rewards come from the VET held for everything, there's no specific category for them.So it seems your statement is correct, the X Node pool is not forever although at the current rate they are using their VET, it'll still take some years to go to 0.Which is contradicting what they wrote on the Medium article of 2018 when it was announced, as there's a phrase that says ""the 5bn will NOT be put into the circulating supply, and that in fact the Foundation will lock them up"". And now we see that those 5bn are all mixed up with the other operational funds... so yeah, nice.#It'll be worth the $8 + whatever the generated vtho is worth, if prices are somehow stable for 50 years. So technically it's worth it *today* if you werent gonna use those $8 anyway.Currently the yearly ROI with VET is 2,18%, which is over 100 times my current ROI on my savings account.But that's not even the point of investing in VET. In stocks, people are speculating on the stock price going up. They don't necessarily intend to get rich off of dividends. Same with VET, you're betting on VET going up, not VTHO.#If anything, I'd take a nice vacation every year paid in Vthor. Companies may need to use it, but maybe they wouldn't all want to buy a bunch of Vet? Perhaps those who pay in vthor would receive a discounted rate over a highly inflated dollar that may become less popular over time? Idk.. maybe.#Wouldn't say it was a dodgy company, hell they are most transparent. And price up? Give it time,  let's get everyone onboard the main net. Then we can judge.#Programming, advertising, researching laws of investing =)#:) I’m always staying objective and never did shilling or fudding.

It’s not accounted for, which means it’s jumbled in with the dev funds, which means it’s not forever.Judging by the downvotes, seems like anyone with a brain has left this sub. Such a sad state.#> There is no planned reduction of X node pool or the rewards associated with it.  If there was the Foundation would make it a priority to communicate it to all of us, especially to us x node holders.The Foundation has never actually stated that the X Node pool lasts forever. So though there may be no plans to reduce it at this time, that doesn’t mean that they can’t or won’t in the future. Would love to see them comment on this.#That statement doesn’t specify that they will lock them up indefinitely though.Could just be a few years or until they see fit... would like to see them comment on this.I’ve never seen it stated by the Foundation that it is forever, though that has been the perception of some of the community.I think it’s because they specified with the economic pool how it would be diminished, but didn’t mention anything with the x node pool.#Totally#you can ean pla for winning games. and in the future by watching them#So the buyback has a double truth - to fund research and to sell back to themselves so operational funding doesn’t drive the price down?#Of course they’re selling it. Your comments implies something nefarious or that they’re gaming the market or something. That’s the only way for non-circulating supply to enter the market.#Sorry, I misunderstood your comment. I accept my downvote fate. I see from your other comment what you meant. It’s the term “walls” it’s had bad connotations forever.#People talk of the sell walls as a device to manipulate price, they are put up and taken down at will, they are not actual orders sitting waiting to be filled, so saying the foundation is responsible for the walls implies they are involved in manipulating prices on exchanges, which is dodgy.  A better term would be sell pressure not sell walls.#Then they would have enough for 50/10 = 5 months... Dont forget that they might also have usd/eth/btc to pay the bills.#Downvotes are a part of life#Blatant vote manipulation IMO. You can see that when a certain community manager starts answering, certain posts go from down-voted to positive and the other way around as well.. Your post was upvoted on the financial report. I also want to have clarity on this. The 5bn VET held by the Foundation to give extra VTHO rewards to X Nodes is mixed with the funds for R&D, operational costs, etc? Or is the 5bn held by the Foundation mixed up in the “soft lock-up” VET held by X Node holders? If it’s the later, I think they should specify it in the reports to not give the wrong impression that token holders own 12bn VET on their X Nodes, when almost half of that is Foundation-owned. If the first answer is the correct one, then yes, X Nodes should worry because the Foundation will eventually sell those 5bn VET.#I think this is highest possibility scenarioBoth processes canceling each other in terms of supply demand#My comment doesn’t imply that#Sure our responsibility as investors to correctly analyze “cash flows” and supply demand dynamics.#Yeah I should use different wording#[deleted]#When someone says ‘walls’ it makes it sound like they’re implying something dodgy. That term has been used time and time again as a bad things. Sorry man. Been here a long time and have seen it be used as a bad thing repeatedly. I doubt the foundation are gonna make walls. Just market sell that shite 😄 plenty more walls to sell on to#And magically after my post the guy goes from -10 to -1 :) Anyway, you didn't really reply to my question: is the 5bn allocated for X Node rewards mixed in the ""soft lock-up"" section of the financial report (that'd be misleading as to how much the community holds, basically lying that we hold almost x2 the reality)  or are the 5bn on the non-circulating supply? And if so, where exactly? Certainly not on the co-founder section, so we're left with Ongoing Ops and Tech Development, Business Development (both need to sell VET every quarter so eventually they'd use the X Node portion if it's there)  or the Enterprise Investor Pool, which means if enough big strategic partners come they'd also sell those VET for the X rewards.#A wall in a healthy market is dodgy. A wall in an immature market to provide liquidity is more like bootstrapping"

If not, what do you mean by the platform is live? How will it burn VTHO then? As far as I recall in the recent medium about the Wechat app going live, they said they're doing 1 blockchain based token and 1 non blockchain based one for easier onboarding.#Reading BYD developments make my spidey senses tingle# [https://twitter.com/crypto\_savage69/status/1174887343435550720](https://twitter.com/crypto_savage69/status/1174887343435550720)Did that go unnoticed?

If you provide greater reward and incentive to those individuals who positively contribute to society then the results will be more people contributing positively in variety of innovative ways to create a better world. Why just reward low carbon lifestyles when you could also reward those volunteers, carers, innovators, bloggers, educators, coaches, etc in a similar ecosystem. The possibilities are endless and the outcome is unfathomable good throughout the world.Go Vechain!!#VeChain have now added DApps onto [dappradar.com](https://dappradar.com) Good to see the focus switching from 'supply chain coin' steadily.#So, I have just found out about the vexchange in the wallet and I have a fair bit of vtho stacked. Can anyone suggest what is the best to do with it? keep stacking or exchange for OCE or something else? CheersBall park...over 5 digits worth of vtho...#A little off topic but everyone should avoid coinmarketcap and use either [openmarketcap.com](https://openmarketcap.com) or  [https://onchainfx.com/](https://onchainfx.com/)These websites have considerably more accuracy than coinmarketcap with actual trading volume and an up to date circulating supply.Coinmarketcap currently reports VeChain's daily volume at $36 million, onchain reports the daily volume as $650,000. Which one seems more realistic to you?#Settlement Coin speculation to the highest degree :Dhttps://twitter.com/wazapepe/status/1175466438154489858?s=19#I remember watching the rebranding event, when everyone was expecting a heavily hinted bmw partnership. I also remember that brutal sell-off as the event was nearing its end with no announcement in sight. I believe it was something like - 20% in a matter of minutes.Then, right before the end, Sunny said the rumors were true and the whole sell-off was bought back in seconds, leaving burned non believers behind.I imagine something similar might happen next week as the buyback clock starts ticking its last hours and minutes. They did it once. They might do it twice. Place your bets, take a seat and enjoy the show.#when do you guys reckon carbon credit tokens will be minted on chain?#[deleted]#Yeah I am trying to figure out how exactly this burns VTHO. That's all I want to know, honestly. Not about that hype life. Just want to see the world burn VTHO#You seem to be working under the impression that the carbon *credit* is a crypto token. I'm not sure that's been specifically stated anywhere (please jump in and correct me if I'm wrong). Data can be written onto the blockchain without needing to have its own seperate coin/platform. The data from user actions could be on chain but the carbon credits could be awarded offchain.As for how it'll burn VTHO, anything that is written to the blockchain requires a payment in VTHO.#Sorry bud, I was away for the weekend, I wasn’t ignoring your message. Seems people below have gone over the topic quite well. Feel free to ask if you have more questions!#Carbon Ecosystem is a huuuuge, and multifaceted project. We’re seeing parts of it come online, a piece at a time. This is gonna take a good while to really contribute to meaningful transactions. It’s great to see it coming alive though. So now we have My Story, Walmart, Carbon Ecosystem, ENN, DIG Wines, Bright code, L28, Norway in a box? any others that I’m missing? And most of them at no where close to full capacity. The list is growing, and looking better and better.#China is so sneaky  I like it... It's always the same: The Chinese, on the surface, appear to be lacking in some areas / industries, then boom! Out of nowhere, they're suddenly viewed as ""leading"" or ""disrupting"". I have a feeling it will be the same with crypto, with this piece of news being one out of a million little foreshadowing developments. Already, there is consensus that China is quietly leading the way in blockchain, despite its apparent aggressive stance against crypto. Overall, China has impressively moved forward for decades without at any point boasting or drawing attention to its intricate strategies. Not that there aren't a thousand things wrong with the country, too. But it's just extraordinary how they've developed so efficiently over the years.#How. Will. It. Burn vtho.#There is no perfect answer for this. Do you think the price of VTHO/VET will rise soon? Then wait for that. Do you think the price will drop or stay the same for a long time? Sell. You can ofcourse also always sell a part of your stack. This way you can spread the risk.&#x200B If you want a better answer it's best that you do your own research on the topic and calculate the different scenario's. Good luck!#I'd wait for VTHO to rise to about 16%, then I'd go for some OCE. although OCE is at a great price (comparative to VET) right now. Or just keep stacking VTHO. That's what I'd do, but take it with a grain of salt.#[removed]#Vexchange doesnt have enough liquidity for that amount of VTHO. Your best bet is to transfer it to OceanEx and sell it for whatever you want :)#Interesting how OceanEx isn't considered a trusted exchange on openmarketcap.com#Coinmarketcap is in partnership with VeChain, so i Think it should be AlrightEdit: Oke. It is OceanEx? Still highly possible that is correct...shareholders of DataAlliance of CMC?#>Then, right before the end, Sunny said the rumors were true and the whole sell-off was bought back in seconds, leaving burned non believers behind.Ironically, this was the moment to sell, 80 000 sats back then = 800 sats now. Because market is not about some blind belief. It's about making smart **timed** strategic decisions.But returning back to the current moment, currently this is perfect spot to DCA here (and I don't care ""I heard this bajillion times last year""). This moment is **now**I’m talking about usd value here. Won’t try to predict sats value in sight of Bakkt launch.#When regulators make it possible. I think the current lack of regulatory guidance and direction is putting the pause on developing ""currencies""#>!The carbon credit here is something that has nothing to do with VTHO really, you could have another system dedicated for that outside of the blockchain. !<Like....a settlement coin?   )#So does the driver have to do something for BYD to write data onchain? Or does it write it automatically?I know for driver to spend the credits they have to read the QR from the car.#It just seems weird that it wouldn't be a token. They can be gained via interacting with products from multiple companies like BYD, ENN, H&M, and Haier. It looks like it will be used to buy things in the WeChat app mall. It will likely need to be traded in a carbon credit market. It could gain traction if it was recognized as a way to pay taxes like SMIT. To me, all of that just screams token.Edit: Also, [this](https://imgur.com/a/7FZ5Y39).#just went to a local walmart today and not seeing the stickers that tracks the mashrooms. all the products that i used to find them with those qr codes are no longer there. i am not seeing any other products with the qr codes that relates to vechain anymore. not sure what it is going on#Stealing intellectual property is very efficient...#Similar to that of the low carbon ecosystem. Through various quality assurance avenues, the data behind good deeds is accurately captured and written to the blockchain which requires vtho to do so.#Sound advice!

This happens at a big scale.Fake it till you make it.Edit: look in the order books yourself before you downvote me.#Yet they have the circulating supply wrong, oceanex uses coinmarketcap too, so also supply wrong..#All of this is wrong.#So you think the buy back will happen on september 30th which is a monday and the last business day of September?#Anything that has to do with Vechain has to do with VTHOR!.....Like....a settlement coin )#[deleted]#You can't expose mainstream users to market volatility like that. The credits being exchangeable for goods means that it would have to be a stable currency.#It wouldn't be good IMO if it were a token. I think of it like our grocery store ""points"" you use them at the gas station to get an amount off of your gas. those 'points' don't mean anything for anyone except the gas station. This is a killer system because I get points just for buying groceries, I don't care what is going on in the background, it's just an added bonus I get for doing something I was going to do anyway. where the vtho burn comes into play, this is how I think of it, is when someone exchanges those carbon credits for something, that has to be recorded, which will be recorded on the blockchain from dnv gl. we don't need to be using vtho or carbon credits as a token. the whole point of being 'powered by vechain' is that when any information is recorded on the blockchain, that uses VTHO. the smart contract owned by dnv gl is the one paying the VTHO. We also don't want it to be a token per say because we want everyone to use the system and not have any idea they're using crypo. we also want it to be super cheap, that way the volume ramps up. I suspect as more companies come online for people to use carbon credits on, and users start actually spending their carbon credits, we'll see mainnet activity ramp up.#A token will end up being traded on an exchange.  I believe they want these credits specifically only used with the carbon credit market .   Idk just thinking out loud#That does not sound good at all. And it would be a devastating explanation for the decreasing mainnet activity. When Vechain announced the Walmart partnership they said:""*The Platform is expected to scale by another* ***100 product lines*** *by the end of the year covering more than* ***10 product categories*** *including fresh meat product, rice, mushrooms, cooking oil, etc.""*The end of the year is not too far away. I somehow feel we should see increasing and not decreasing mainnet usage at this point if everything went as planned. There is no way to check if a data clause on mainnet is related to Walmart without buying the product at a local Walmart store, right?!Please keep us updated! Highly appreciate your posts about Walmart product tracking!#I've thought for a few weeks now that the pullback in transactions was Walmart related. My guess, proof of concept is complete, they are now working to scale it to the full lineup that was mentioned at launch. I fully expect transactions to increase and surpass where they were in the coming weeks/months if this is what's happening.#you need to share pics with a comment like that really.#That's potentially disturbing news.  Where is that local Walmart?#Thank you for sharing!#😲                   😖#To be fair, so long as they’re permitted to do it, why wouldn’t they?#Vexchange is a perfect tool, but it has approx 1% fees. If you are talking about 5 digits worth of VTHO, it might be worthwhile to exchange manually at oceanex where the vet/vtho pair for example only attracts 0.05% fees (minus potentially your trading fee discount coming from your oceanex level membership).#Sorry, I just assume everyone thinks like me I should have clarified. 16% of VET price. so .16 - Right now we're almost 15% (.1476)#https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2019/05/01/happy-6th-birthday-data-alliance-block-explorers-and-more/Ok. Then correct me? What is this in  your opinion?#From what I recall the few buyback days we have had were Mondays or Tuesdays, usually in the evening (Central European Time). So could happen, Mondays are one of their favorite days.What I dont see fitting in here however is that spending 3mil USD in one go would mean buying a large part of VET at a much higher price. They pump it to 80 sats with their buys, (just an example) so their last buys are going through for almost twice the current value. That makes no sense from a financial point of view. I would buy back in smaller parts but regularly if I was in their place, to not create that large of a price swing. Somewhere there has to be a line between oh lets wait till the absolute end and then surprise MF (like the mentioned BMW announcement) and common sense (in this case financial discipline and simply not throwing away half a mil USD in value if you dont have to).#There's no guarantee, but risk:reward is very good here.#I thought its linked from the moment you drive off the dealer, wasn't the app meant for spending the credits your car earns based on the data it writes to blockchain?#Yea, I agree that volatility would be bad for end users.  That's why I think tying in the settlement coin with the CVCT would be incredible. The CVCT's value would be based on how much good your actions do for the world, and I can't think of a more appropriate unit of value or unit of account than that.  Transitioning from fiat currency to that though seems like an uphill battle.#So what do you make of the fact that it is listed as a token in the screenshot in the app store?#from what i see, within walmart itself there are competions. there are qr codes from the producers that tracks similar info as what walmart does and they are basically in direct competion (different brands of mushrooms and other produce). from the consumer ends, they really dont care about the tracking. at least i am not seeing anyone scanning qr codes. they just trust walmart. the qr codes are nice to have but its are to justify the value at the moment. personally i think the strength should be b2b for vechain or machine to machine like carbon credit and not b2c#OMG random user reports not finding mushroom with QR code at Walmart.People on this sub start panicking. How old are you guys?!#It could equally mean Walmart ran their proof of concept and they didn’t get the result they were hoping for, so they’re pulling the plug on it. Probably not the case, but cause for concern nonetheless.#i will try to take one next week#Exactly, very reckless statement to make. My company does batch/lot testing all the time. Maybe Walmart ran their lots and are now accessing the results and planning on their next moves.#the store that i went to locates in dongguan#Stealing is wrong whether it is permitted or not, and there's nothing impressive about it.#A couple days ago there was a typical buyback like movement with 10-12million bought every 10 minutes for a while. I suspect they are not withdrawing it to the buyback address to hide the timing.#Is it possible to buy 800 million vet in a couple hours though? Those whales must have huge stacks by now. It seems the bots are programmed to keep placing sell orders.#[deleted]#I'd be disappointed. The carbon credit system was one I was hoping would be the one that 'uses crypto without using crypto'. Although, if it's a token but not in the traditional sense, maybe they have it in the app so you can store your CC into your wallet, but there won't be anywhere to trade the token (with the exception of spending them at retailers that opt into the program), the wallet is used just to hold them. I'd be fine with that. In fact, now I'm hoping that's the case here.Edit: If they did have it as a holding spot for carbon credits then the vechain wallet could act as the wallet you attach your carbon credit apps to (the one you configure with your electric car) - And that would be cool. it wouldn't just be a wallet, it would be a carbon credit app as well.#Fair enough, they might not be scanning the codes, but I believe people will subconsciously start buying goods with the codes rather than those without it. Just seeing a product having the code might be enough to have a buying edge over other products.#Seems pretty damn useful to have someone in other countries like China with resources like that. It’s not like us in the USA can go to our local liquor stores and see Vechain QR codes on our Penfolds bottles. I really value those observations rather than just trusting any rumors#Completely agree... talk about taking some random stranger's word as true and running with it. Classic crypto. There's a multitude of reasons that there may or may not be QR codes, but first, let's ask the key question - pics/proof? or it didn't happen.#That could be the case, but I remember Sunny said that since the implementation of VeChain tracking solutions, their net earnings went up by 10% (by both the combination of selling more and saving money they were previously spending on their own tracking solutions). Even if it was half of that, there's no way someone wouldn't want to scale up. */endhopium*#Definitely could be the case, we'll find out soon enough#thats what i have been hoping for too. it would be nice if someone in china would share their local walmart observations too#In some sense.  If western companies are tacitly agreeing to it to access low cost Chinese labor markets then it’s not precisely “stealing” and more a quid pro quo arrangement.I don’t support it, mind you, but that’s what it seems to be.#It is possible to buy 800 million vet in couple of minutes, I just don't know why you assume it will be done in the last day.#Depending on HOW MUCH of my data and what kind of data is being taken from the car. Is this data about how much I drive? If so yeah. That's fine. If it's about HOW i drive. Or where I go or things like that then I'll definitely pass. I'm a fairly privacy centric person and don't like the ever intruding info companies are asking us to provide.#Still confused I rewatched [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVWPYT0RU0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVWPYT0RU0s) and got this:""apps installed on BYD vehicles CAN collect driving data""""by scanning the QR code, users will be able to authorize and synchronize the data collected by the vehicle on the mobile app""So sounds like the car's data is put to use (written to blockchain) only when customer wishes to use the BYD Di-link carbon credit app. From the looks of it its a trade of data and the carbon credit ""tokens"" initiated by the driver. Raises the question why in the hell does it have to be driver initiated.. I mean yeah sure to use the credits I have to open the app but I think it would be better to see the credits accumulate in the UI passively and get a prompt to offers.  Does China have it's own version of GDPR or what's the deal here?#Pics of something that is not there anymore, yeah right!#He wasn't talking about Walmart but the Australian wine company#The project wouldn't be public if they hadn't already run a lot of tests remember. Let's not panic on small things. It's unlikely a company like Walmart invests heavily and then pulls something after about 2 months. It's not long enough to gauge success/failure.#They could easily take a pic of the product without the QR on. The product has a date on so hardly a difficult thing to do.... all i read is hearsay until then."

I'm gonna have y'all over to my local bar to celebrate..it will happen. https://www.bonaccordpub.com/#Vechain said that they are very picky with who they give support on their blockchain.  So with TicTalk are we really thinking it is going to be left to die? or is something coming?#Just read an article about footwear company New  Balance doing a pilot project using Cardano to authenticate products. Its encouraging to know that more and more companies are investigating blockchain to trace the origins of products. Wasnt even aware that Cardano offered that as a service to trace authenticity like Vechain, but it seems the demand is certainly growing in this area. Surely Vechain's solution would be far superior to what they are offering, a large part I guess comes down to project visibility to source a solution. Still good news though I believe#Happy Saturday to everyone checking in on VeNews#For the Dutch and Belgian folks here, I recommend [bitvavo](https://account.bitvavo.com/dashboard) for converting fiat to and from VET. You can buy/sell VTHO there as well. It's KYC though.#X-node prices are really holding up here and providing a reason to hold the vet that is needed to keep them even when the price is crashing to ATL and beyond - almost 1M for x-node today#Haven’t been active for a while. I don’t really care what happens now because I know the future is bright. I just came back from a long trip in SEA and one of the first things that I read in my own bed was Spencer Dinwiddie of the Brooklyn nets is tokenizing his assets. His earnings basically. I couldn’t dig too much into it because I have a lot of paper work to catch up on but I bring this up because Spencer and Sunny Lu both follow each other. Or have in the past. What this means in short is if this is related to VeChain at all, we are going to get tons of publicity in all age groups. The NBA is huge and is basically the story line of 3-5 major networks for the next 6 months. The NBA isn’t allowing Spencer to do this but don’t for one minute think he isn’t talking to the players union and other players alike. TL DR Huge NBA fan,  read that a professional player from the Brooklyn Nets wants to tokenize his earnings. Sunny Lu and Spencer Dinwiddie follow/followed each other on Twitter.#An interesting perspective on ranking Cryptocurrencies [here](https://wisecryptos.com/wise-crypto-ratings/) Not reading too much into it but I was just interested to see a ranking system independent of price.Original tweet:  https://twitter.com/kubli_kan/status/1177611390002970624?s=21#2x 25 million vet from OceanEx to buy back 2 hours ago: [https://explore.veforge.com/transactions/0x040ce9c8f04189149a5a6854964523b89c288ce88a948bd4b519a9d6ba5d77bf](https://explore.veforge.com/transactions/0x040ce9c8f04189149a5a6854964523b89c288ce88a948bd4b519a9d6ba5d77bf)  [https://explore.veforge.com/transactions/0x35ca58b0054e86038a7d811deddd7d7a9325b1355e25b849d01520322943bb10](https://explore.veforge.com/transactions/0x35ca58b0054e86038a7d811deddd7d7a9325b1355e25b849d01520322943bb10) So we will probably see some more deposits either later today or tomorrow. We're still far away from the 5M dollars though.#Had some real positive dreams last night...I just have to say: we’ve been hearing a huge amount about how TA has us setting up to bleed hard. Newtons law is for every shitty TA there is an equal and opposite shitty TA. They were saying the same at $3xxxBTC. My smartass friend was saying buying $3k BTC was foolish since TA was set to drop lower and if you don’t follow TA you shouldn’t be in this market at all.But you gotta trust your gut because TA is too either/or. That’s what I did buying $3-$4k BTC. Got the same feeling now.BTC was $8k ahead of the BAKKT announcement. A correction was expected. Not saying null run 2019 but I don’t think we’ll be in bear market all year#Yeah interesting. I didn’t want to write a post because it would be too speculative, but while I was researching all this AN movements and Oceanex movements and so on, I stumbled upon some curious bits of info which made me believe there are wallets with some insider info making very interesting moves.#Just picking up a few x nodes before VET hits a dollar next week. Don't mind me#Been looking into some stuff with the vechainstats rich list and even though these are very short timelines and small sample size, I've found that between 9/25 and 9/28 (today) the number of wallets with >100k VTHO increased by 40 and wallets with over 1 million VTHO increased by 12. Thought this would be an interesting way to see how many wallets are saving/stocking up on VTHO, for speculation or use. Projects will need VTHO to start pumping out transactions.9/15 - 9/28 wallets with 1M VET or more increased by 65 and 5M+ VET increased by 25. I was thinking in terms of new investors but now I see it might be people moving things around for various reasons such as X-nodes like you've shown. Started looking at this because I figured even with a slow mainnet, more wallets accumulating more VET is a good thing.As I typed this another wallet crossed the 1M VTHO mark.#Oh interesting.. let me just... *Runs to market and cancels xnode for sale*#Nice catch. Maybe an institutional investor betting on the future value of X-node benefits? In terms of fiat, X-nodes are pretty cheap right now for new entrants to the market.#I also noticed this guy a couple minutes ago and it seems like he has another X-Node.[https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0xb83b4fc064b231d2cdb8f9e8ba632927f898c215](https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0xb83b4fc064b231d2cdb8f9e8ba632927f898c215)I'm assuming this because that address sent 1.2 Million to the main one. Edit: this is also the account that sent 1k VTHO to the first X-Node that was purchased:  [https://explore.veforge.com/transactions/0x62b6cba906eacbcde437a6d1c2d6692e55f92cd8a22c40292374a6153f7bef0d](https://explore.veforge.com/transactions/0x62b6cba906eacbcde437a6d1c2d6692e55f92cd8a22c40292374a6153f7bef0d)And I also found this account (Strength X) from which the 15.75 Million were sent to the main one initially:[https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x51683a4e7577ba51b7feefd5d12323e5e0a529d8](https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0x51683a4e7577ba51b7feefd5d12323e5e0a529d8)Tx ID:  [https://explore.veforge.com/transactions/0xbe93ea6ab541c4f7c6c871d85a04b68b64932dd05a74167446b616aed2a5f4b4](https://explore.veforge.com/transactions/0xbe93ea6ab541c4f7c6c871d85a04b68b64932dd05a74167446b616aed2a5f4b4)Edit 2:   And the 5th wallet you sent ([https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0xaa35d22bf06e5d6638f458fdcf78c92bd1bf0532](https://explore.veforge.com/accounts/0xaa35d22bf06e5d6638f458fdcf78c92bd1bf0532)) just bought the next X-Node**So it looks like a total of 6 X-Nodes and 1 Strength X in his possession so far.**#For some of us with day jobs to own a VET node we need to be 50-almost 100% invested in VET (my definition of VET addict). While others with actual money can buy plural X nodes and only have a couple % of their blockfolio invested in VET. My guess is the latter.But if you wanna go on with $1 VET EOM by all means brøther, proceed.#I'll be there. Whole round on me for whoever comes.#Your kids can invite our kids to your local bar to celebrate the foundations we laid, because non of us will be alive!#I thought you meant you were going to buy a pub with your profits#🤞#I’ll sit on a wall opposite with a bucky it’ll be fine#Saved this post and I'm in.

Have always wanted to visit as well.#Count me in, but let's define 'beyond the moon' so I know when my attendance is expected.#Thats an awesome idea. Just imagine the vibe in there when we're doing a toast on our 1$ VET investment#You don't need support from Vechain to start anything on the blockchain. Tictalk was never a Vechain endorsed project in the first place - in retrospect there was probably a good reason for this. Sunny said they advised Tictalk and Tictalk did not take their advise. Result was a lot of supporters getting screwed. To me this is openly distancing yourself.  You have to understand that these companies stand on their own and Vechain or Cream can't force them to do anything. Sometimes your children go rogue that's just how it is. DYOR but please be aware. Vechain can't start taking responsibility for these projects. Next couple of years the number of projects will start growing exponentially Vechain and Oce can't police that.#I suppose CREAM showed that they're not that picky.#They have to pick themselves up from the mess they created#Tell myself I won’t but I still do daily#Why do you recommend?#I'm annoyed that Litebit and Anycoindirect cover Vechain yet.#[removed]#Pretty sure the nba won’t allow this#They determine the cost of tx by what binances charges are to withdraw?Binance sets it at 100 vet, so that is not really the cost... That's binance fee.The actual cost of vet tx is what sets it apart from any other crypto and the fact that cost is designed to be constant. Also I don't take any website seriously when they outright disregard nano or pretend it doesn't exist.#We’re getting pretty close. VET was way more expensive at the start of the buyback and we don’t know how much they bought at what time.#Seriously, telling us about positive dreams is just unnecessary and makes people who start every post with 'I feel' look like Einsteins#I was thinking you probably have noticed certain trends while doing your digging & research. I'm sure you've hesitated to post less concrete observations, but I would be interested to hear what else you've come across, even if a bit tin foil-ish. On that note, I'd like to say your posts have been great to read.#This morning I have been moving my X-nodes as well. I've posted in the previous daily, but I think I was not clear: in my Veforge Vault a new token showed up called 'VET+'. I don't see it in the mobile Vechain Wallet. If this is linked to X Nodes, that would make sense selling an Mjolnir X node, splitting the money into several X-nodes and sell them once the news comes out.Did you find anything related to ""VET+""?#X node benefits?? what is this mystical thing you speak of? :D#I mean, I’m not sure what the definition of day jobs is, but vet is around 20% of my port and I have an x node.  I work as an IT Project Manager (9-5 if that is your definition). Beyond that, it depends when you enter the market.  At this point in time you can buy the Xcode and the required amount of vet to maintain the status for around 4k, so I think it depends less on money and more on priorities.  My focus is on early retirement (28 right now) so I’m conservative in my spending beyond investments, and it would be a no brainer to me to drop 4k for the potential massive upside.#😂😂😂😂😂😂#Its Glasgow#WHISKY!!!#[removed]#[deleted]#Me too, but now I've limited myself to morning news update and before bed news update lol#You can pay/deposit with Ideal (instant) and they do not charge a deposit fee.

Frank Yiannas, former Walmart VP for Food Safety and a strong convert on the use of blockchain for supply chain tracking for food safety ([https://www.computerworld.com/article/3309656/qa-walmarts-frank-yiannas-on-the-use-of-blockchain-for-food-safety.html](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3309656/qa-walmarts-frank-yiannas-on-the-use-of-blockchain-for-food-safety.html)) became the US Food and Drug Administration's Deputy Commissioner in charge of food safety late last year ( [https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/frank-yiannas](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/frank-yiannas)).While not immediately and directly connected to Vechain yet, having the chief US food regulator bullish on blockchain for food tracking like this can only serve to grow the use case and set standard practices.It does look like there was some attempt at connecting him with Vechain ([https://twitter.com/FrankYiannasFDA/status/1100856006538596352](https://twitter.com/FrankYiannasFDA/status/1100856006538596352)), and he is on the program for next month's China International Food Safety and Quality Conference in Beijing ([http://www.chinafoodsafety.com/conference\_e.htm](http://www.chinafoodsafety.com/conference_e.htm)).

They over-deliver. Nobody expected shit like Walmart. The only thing that is disappointing, is the price (and ok, maybe the amount of transactions....But that's still growing). And yes, we all agree on that part. But that will hopefully follow eventually.#[deleted]#[deleted]#Every time the user claims carbon credits, essentially. That involves the car sending off some data for processing and converting to carbon credits#[deleted]#[removed]#At a glance it seems like DBET is just trying to cover everything whilst PLA is more focused on gaming, e-sports and streaming coming in the near future.#Peeps too salty, hands are swollen holding heavy bags. They forgot that crypto moves up as fast as it goes down. ATH is visible within 2 years. And probably even more.#No, it is not pessimistic. It's nearly a 25x from current prices, in five years, so hundreds of percent per year. That's your idea of pessimistic?#See @Amazon.Not saying VeChain is anything like Amazon but 2017 was a massive bubble and I wouldn’t be surprised if it took us that long to reach ATH.#[deleted]#But would we not be able to see the minted token on the blockchain atleast? Could we not find it now?#[deleted]#Are the transactions really disappointing? If they started off at 50k and worked up to 150k we would probably all be ecstatic.#[deleted]#Your throwing numbers out of your ass#Wasn't it 900k ppl?#[deleted]#I hope i’m wrong. But first off - what is the time commitment to link your car?Second off the rewards. If they’re not that large I think many people won’t bother linking.

Did you just join crypto?#What most people see as a bubble will probably be considered as a „early small spike“ compared to the real bubble in a few years. We haven‘t seen the masses entering a more mature and regulated crypto market with many convincing use cases. This will be for much later and it will be epic.#1T isnt shit. A bubble relative to real word usage at the time no doubt, but I would hardly call it a ""massive"" bubble. A long term blip.#You can test your existing seed words by going to create/import wallet on current phone then choose import from seed, put in seed and if correct it will say something similar to, ""this wallet already exists would you like to reset it's password""#[deleted]#Someone could likely find it on the blockchain, yes.#It's fine if you don't agree.. but at least give some reasoning behind it instead of just saying it bluntly.#I'm here from ICO and I hate those comments. Eventually you run out of money to throw at investments. Everyone got their chance to buy cheap, it's time for growth. Current price is a pure disaster looking where we came from and with what VeChain achieved in the meantime.#The majority of what he wrote makes no sense.#Just for clarification: I'm not Ben. I just share his content in this sub, among others.#How intelligent are you, thinking skythe4 is Ben?#do you think that because skythe4 posted a link of Ben's video/tweet, that means that they are Ben?#According to this video demo ( https://youtu.be/zVWPYT0RU0s ) it’s just scanning a QR whenever you ultimately decide to.

One of those things probably appeals to most people. And you’re right, not everyone probably will, but that’s fine. We just need a solid majority - a normal distribution chart of engagement kinda thing.#[deleted]#IMO they should find a better balance for the fake volume.

But that doesn’t mean that I won’t take 5+ years to see it.#The real bubble in a few years..?The bubble that just happened was as real as it gets  It's inflated prices compared to the real value. You're talking about convincing use cases, that doesn't sound like a bubble to me, more like organic growth based on adoption.#Just curious, after you have done that you can access your wallet on both phones or is the old automatically deleted?#It's time for people who are late compared to us to actually feel the pain  )#Rekt#Lmao#I bought a new washing machine recently, it had a QR code sticker on it that said 'Scan to Register'. Without even thinking about it I got out my phone and scanned the code. No incentive needed. I think most people will set this up simply as part of *unpackaging* their new vehicle.#Just that....a great many people will simply not take the time to get involved in any way. This happens time and time again in the business world....a product solution can seem like an absolute no-brainer and yet the company is shocked that, simply put, it didn't catch on. It's way, way, WAY harder than you are giving credit to just suddenly integrate any change into the lives of hundreds of thousands of people instantly. You are being grossly optimistic to assume ""10% won't opt in.""#So you should know better. A x25 can happen anytime in the next couple of years. But it won‘t take 5 years. That‘s basically saying we wont see any bull run in the next 5 years. Unlikely#Could be. I hope it will be earlier but 3-4 more years (or 5) is probably realistic#That was a very small bubble (that appears big because the reference is on a very low level). I think that we are so early stages for blockchain, that it feels more like Internet in 1994 right now and not when the dotcom bubble exploded in 2001. So many years to come with adoption rising. And then one day we will have a real bubble, based on unrealistic expectations and hype (not only because of the adoption itself). There will be another bubble and it will be huge. But only a few years down the road.#Think of the seed word as a key to your house. Your house never moves, you can always get into your house with your key. The wallet apps you use are just your car/bus/Uber that gets you to the house.#[deleted]#[deleted]#Knowing better is understanding that losing 96% is a heck of a lot easier than gaining 2500%.#I live in a vehicle. My house moves often.#Thanks!#1) Realists are valuable people as well, nowhere in the sub's rules does it say you need to be full blown ODing on hopium to be allowed to post here, and 2) as a fellow optimist on this project, only ridiculous overstatements like yours could make me appear otherwise.# No. It‘s the same value up or down.

wallstreetbets;d7y002;1569193441.0;/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d7y002/conspiracy_theory_time/;Conspiracy theory time;Okay so over the weekend I stole some adderall from my little sister and decided to read Flash boys by Michael Lewis. If you haven’t read the book, it’s all about the flash crash of 2010 when a bunch of high frequency traders algorithms stacked on top of each other causing the market to bend over and grab its ankles for 36 minutes before regaining most of the losses moments after. Queue spooky music Fast forward to 2019 we are in arguably the longest bull run in history (can’t emphasize arguably enough) where data is the new oil and everyone is willing to give up there data to dodge commission fees. This big data is thrown into a super computer with crazy algorithms and data sets that can recognize patterns and trends 100000x better than the average autist can. This big data has never been more accessible and has to be effecting the market in some way, and I think it’s effecting it a lot more than other autists believe..;"Sir, this is a WeWork office space.#No conspiracy this is real.#Think about how accessible the markets were to the average person only 10 years ago compared to where they are today.Robinhood, M1Finance, other commission free trading platforms are allowing anybody to throw a few dollars into the market and getting them hooked.It is drawing in people who would otherwise be blowing these dollars at a casino because they are gamblers not investors. People who have been mastering the markets and adapting to the way they evolve for generations are no doubt doing the same today, and figuring out the most effective ways to separate this new type of investor from their money.Only now, they are more empowered than ever due to the advanced algorithms and technologies that they employ to do their bidding.#In other words, HFT? where is the conspiracy?#Conspiracy theory without a conspiracy... Infact there's no theory here#Thanks op, bought 100x supercomputers.#I would agree, except I think you're conflating algorithmic trading with HFT.HFT algo's don't exactly play the long game.  To quote Matt Hurd:> don’t worry about the next tick. Encourage market structures that are competitive, fair, and cheap. Then you can stand back and watch with glee why those HFT firms kill each other fighting for the lowest spread. This enables their liquidity to serve you, despite their motivations. After all, only buying higher and selling lower (i.e. narrowing the real spread) works to compete for the next tick. That is not a recipe for easy HFT money. He points out that most HFTs are trading thousands of times per day, often only for the next tick.  They aren't concerned about how the stock is moving, only the micro of it.  Asset managers have way more say in how the stock market moves.A better explanation would be the rise of ETFs like Vanguard who control billions in assets when people invest in them.  They have to purchase multiple stocks at the same time for something like the $SPY, stocks that the average user wouldn't normally purchase.  Along with QE at the beginning of this, along with how long the bull run has been going (since the market doing well gets more people to invest in it), it provides a better theory for the massive bull run.#You forgot the punchline...#what the fuck is the conspiracy? you just went on a meth rant without ever stating your point#This is a new low point for this sub.#Did you ever wonder how Robinhood exists? Payment for oder flow my dude. Right to the quants#there is supposed to be a movie or series on this in netflix, wish it would come out already...#Maybe the effect it has is a never ending bull run? I mean you could build like an overseer algorithm that keeps the charts going up, if it controls enough capital.#Ngl I always thought Flash Boys was about gay college dudes#So much data, all of these numbers what do they mean?   707 707 707 5318008#Flash boys didn’t really age well.#where is the conspiracy i already knew all this shit#That's why I reset my limit sell order for 420 shares of AMD always @$6969.35... daily.#This ain't no conspiracy nibba, this is da truff.#Ah you think this is a conspiracy, yeah the autism runs deep, you belong here.#Affect=verb  Effect=noun#I thought this was a Kinko's?  :)#Oh that explains all the money that's lost#Wish I could double upvote#Idk bro maybe that it’s been 9 years since the flash crash and our trading data is 20x more accessible and the Data sets are 20x better and it’s the fuel for this bull market#The conspiracy is that these hft are fueling the bull run more than we think...#Lemme borrow one, but not for trading....#Well explained thank you#""AMD to 69"" -OP#Yes.#wsb  isnt for himhe belongs on r/personalfinance or r/investing#Ah?

Or inverse that?#This is Pop Copy, bitch#Look up what happened in the 1980's when computer assisted trading first became a thing.  It contributed to one of the worst stock collapses in history.

Shows you're eager to learn more, so I'm happy to reply.VIP-191 is aimed to supplement MPP by providing extra flexibility for TX fee delegation. VIP-191 allows a TX sender to seek for a random party to pay for the TX. If we compare VIP-191 to MPP directly, biggest change is that VIP-191 gives control back to the TX sender wich has to activate the protocol.In short  [VIP-191 enables a 3rd party, such as a dApp or a wallet, to pay for transaction fees on behalf of the sender, while still allowing the sender to maintain full control over their transaction signing and sending lifecycle.](https://medium.com/@totientlabs/vip191-the-key-to-mass-adoption-1beccd902a78)#"" VIP 191 is an upgrade to the VeChain core blockchain. Initially proposed  by Totient, it allows users to bypass a transaction fee (VTHO) by  delegating it to an application they are using. Many are familiar with  MPP, a multi-party payment protocol that allows a smart contract owner  to sponsor transaction costs. VIP-191 expands this by allowing sponsors  to pay for transaction costs, even if they are not the owner of the  contract."" From Vechain101.#More consumer-side usage as the developers are paying on behalf of people who aren't expected to even know what a blockchain is.#You are totally correct! MPP is basically useless to D'app producers. It's only really an institutional / enterprise solution (hello Walmart), where they want to fund their own contracts and the persons talking to those contracts are their own guys. In terms of actually using it for a user-facing D'app it's not usefull because you can't define on what kind of transactions te middle man is spending his VTHO. Simply said: VIP-191 is user oriëntated rather than focussed on enterprise use. VIP-191 makes you create a transaction, which you then give to someone who needs to sign it (app-user), and you can sign over that again to make the transaction definite. Therefore the D'app developer can enter certain requirements to make a transaction. When those requirements aren't met, he can still reverse the transaction made by the user.VIP-191 is therefore the main protocol used for D'apps (like they made for Carbon Credits) which needs to interact with an extra party.#That Stamp Trader guy on Twitter was shilling the BXY tokens for weeks.#Can you explain this a little more?#Yea I am still looking at options for this.

Unfortunately, it's not my own or else the whole place would be a YangGang paradise. In addition, the owners are Trump supporters (one is apolitical, and the other is an unreasonable person), so I can't do much with the decor. I have been talking to my customers/patients about Andrew Yang. What I have noticed is that when I talk to them about Amazon, automation, or tech data, I don't get a strong reaction. However, when I start talking about how pharmaceutical companies are using their data to:1. Know which drugs to make (if more patients have heart disease then research heart disease drugs)2. Know where to sell their drugs(concentrate heart disease drugs in a population where heart diseases persist)3. Know where to push their sales team (the adjacent hospital is a surgical one, so I get a lot of sales rep for pain meds)When I tell them that their data is being sold to and used by big pharma to make millions of dollars and they get nothing in return, that's when they start to get it. That's when I finish them off with a Fatality. Jk, I introduce the FD. Many have asked who is this guy again? Can you write down the name for me? Of course, the talking points for the FD also helps, but the points about Big Pharma and Big Data reinforces the FD. If you plan to use this method, please remember to include that the FD will stack on top of their social security benefits.I hope this helps! Someone here also mentioned you can call (877)926-4202 to listen to Yang's DNC speech.

Thanks!  you are awesome!#Also, data as a property right is on his platform. Which means that your information should not be given to anyone without your consent and you should know who is making rent by selling derived data from it or mining it over time.Yang’s proposals include expanding Medicare and putting a stop on outrageous healthcare and pharmaceutical costs by benchmarking costs of care against other countries. Because we don’t have a healthcare system designed to lower costs for anyone for its companies we will have to force American companies to compete where other countries solved it. There is hardly any innovation happening in routine, basic procedures fixing a broken arm or ambulance visit since 1965 but costs have skyrocketed for decades. Other countries may have private insurance options that are affordable because the public option most people take is able to negotiate effectively.No other candidate is able to handle this kind of a complex reality now with their proposals. All their proposals are decades behind the reality of tech companies or healthcare companies looking for their next massive revenue generators.#Keep up the good work! :)#Part of my idea came from Andrew Yang’s podcast with YouTuber, nigahiga (Ryan Higa) when Andrew Yang was asked how much does a person’s data cost? Andrew briefly talked about how if you have a disease, then your data becomes more valuable. Something along that line. So he knows. I just elaborated and connected it back to the FD.#Thanks! I dig it too!#Awesome! More ammunition for the YangGang!#Humanity-first!#Thanks man! Trying to keep that momentum alive!#I agree. Yang has more knowledge of what's happening on the ground than the other candidates. He is also open to solutions outside his scope as long as the data support such solutions.
cscareerquestions;d7evgp;1569093458.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d7evgp/got_offerred_an_internship_at_the_nsa_and_curious/;Got offerred an internship at the NSA and curious about how pursuing it would model my career.;[deleted];[deleted]#Accept it but keep applying in case your background doesn't complete. I would not consider a conditional to withhold you from continuing to look in case it doesn't work out. The worst thing would be that it doesn't work out and you have no internship next summer.#TS/SCI, especially in the DC area, is worth some serious extra money if you end up going civilian contractor.  Coming from the NSA is another feather in your cap with a number of employers who are doing work there anyway.  I have no idea what you're talking about with the reputation of NSA folks.  I hired dozens when I worked in the area and was never anything less than happy with their skills - like Defcon/Derbycon headliner level of smarts.  I think you'd be pleasantly surprised (and challenged) by some of your peers.  Don't stress over not being able to speak to what you were doing.  Stick to the tech aspects of it, leave the details of how it was being used out.#ts/sci with full scope poly is the real gold ticket#lol Microsoft and Amazon are both looking for tons of TS/Poly cleared individuals to join their team. You can definitely have a huge advantage over others when it comes to applying to jobs at commercial companies around the DC area. Also 80k is pretty standard for most new grads in the DC area.#NSA == Poor Talent == Does Not Compute. Who told you this? If anything, your time at the NSA would catapult you to the front of the line for any position requiring a cybersecurity skillset, etc., so to me, the decision comes down to this: What do you want to do?#Please realize 80k out of college put you in the ~94th percentile for earners your age. I get its low relative to salaries for Bay area companies or seattle, but people live in DC with way less, so put it in perspective.#I have worked as defense contractor and done a lot of private sector work.  It all depends on your life goals.  If you want to earn above 250k, then the only way is to go to the Bay area or Seattle and maybe NYC and work for a big private company.  If your okay making less money, with older technology but very relaxed and easy work and environment then maybe defense is for you.  I would recommend when you are young to try the Bay area if that interests you.As far as the internship goes, feel free to take it, private sector companies will like that your tried defense and can say the pros and cons.  You will be able to talk about the work you did at a high level, just not details especially about the data.  I have worked with a lot of really smart people in the defense space.  As other said, clearances are gold in the DC area, when I was there, I would get 5 offers in a week once I decided to look.  A lot of the jobs aren't good tho, so you gotta be careful.Also Amazon is always desperate for devs with clearance, and then you can transfer once your in to a more enjoyable project if you don't like it.  With Amazon coming to DC the dynamics in the area could change.  Remember it's just an internship, it's not going to make or break your career either way.  Any internship is better than no internship.  Learn as much as you can, talk to people, ask them what is good and bad.  It's all about learning.#Accept it. Who knows, maybe one day you'll sell a book :) https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1174105969179189251#An internship is better than not an internship but you will have a much more lucrative career in private sector. You’ll probably have some very interesting problems to work on with a wide range of low to high skilled coworkers that aren’t that motivated to perform well. So is it best for someone looking for mentoring? Maybe not maybe so, depends. Is working there anything like working at any modern tech company? No.But the clearance could get you in to some tech companies doing work with the federal government so that could help. Take it if you don’t have a better offer but I wouldn’t look to transition to full time. Their goal (and all federal government) is to capture graduates into jobs and then keep them there because they can’t actually compete for experienced people with their salary/benefits. That isn’t a joke, that was paraphrased from someone at a three letter in charge of hiring when asked how they compete with private sector about two months ago at a conference.#Having security clearance is a plus for many jobs that work with the government. Especially military, cyber security, etc...#Did you pass/take the polygraph test already? I had a “conditional” offer for this high school senior program many years back, and couldn’t pass the polygraph for the life of me while telling the truth for whatever reason.The tester kept nudging me to confess to stuff I’ve never done (illegal drugs or committing a crime), but at the end of the day, the HR lady said that most people don’t pass on their first time. Thus, because the pay was good for a 17 year old, I decided to make the trek back to Fort Meade a second time, where my new polygraph tester said all my responses were spiking, signifying I was harboring some deep dark secret (as a minor). At that point, working there just seemed like too much of a hassle for me, and given that I had nothing to confess, I told the dude just to let me leave rip.Long story short, know that there is a chance you might not pass the polygraph tests, so like other commenters, I’d suggest continuing to look for other positions too.#A clearance is a golden ticket. Plus, Howard county is awesome#Doing IT for the government was one of the most boring jobs I've ever had.  Literally not a single motivated person.  Tread with caution.#I wouldn’t accept it. I got offered a NSA co-op my freshmen year and In retrospect I’m very grateful that I didn’t take that offer.The co-op was essentially something like.. every other semester I would go work for 15/hr which is really shitty for a software engineering co-op. Don’t let others tell you that you’re making in the top X percentage compared to people your age. Don’t fall into that trap. Secondly and most importantly... people don’t realize this but as you pick up “job experience” you begin to pigeonhole yourself to certain types of jobs and that’s up to you if you want to work for the DoD or related contracting work for the rest of your life.Just FYI how it turned out for me.. I now work at a top tech company making pretty close to 200k a year and I just graduated college this may. You have to think about the long game and how you compare to people your age who are also just graduating and getting software dev jobs.Lastly, top companies have been poaching top talent from the government and universities for years! If you want to work at a place filled with passionate, driven, and talented people choose your work place wisely.#[deleted]#I like how people here refuse to work for Palantir on ethical grounds, but NSA is considered perfectly fine lol#Prob not with internships but isn't hard to go from TS/SCI jobs back to civilian stuff because you can't necessarily talk in detail about what you did?#The only issue is that having a security clearance in AWS often forces you to take on a lot more DevOps than the average SDE, which can stifle your early career progression.I have a number of coworkers who regret their decision to obtain their security clearance, even though they’re compensated more for it.Edit - I should clarify that I don’t believe that it’s never a good decision to pursue the cleared engineer route. I meant to say that it doesn’t make sense for everyone. If that’s an area of the industry that you’re interested in, then by all means go for it.#[deleted]#Also, FT. Meade isn't really in DC so the COL will be lower. 80k is average for DC but pretty good for its outskirts.#[deleted]#Lmao#And then have the government take all of the money from your book.#[deleted]#I've reviewed a bunch of resumes from CIA/NSA/DoD folks. They can't go into detail about projects they worked on, but you can still get an idea of what their skillset is.#[deleted]#No developer is going to work in an environment without the internet.  I have worked in 50+ scifs and always had the internet.#How do you look up questions on stackoverflow if there's no internet?#Many SCIFs have virtual desktops but no phones, Bluetooth, or other wireless devices are allowed in.#But who wants to actually live in ft Meade?#Go to IBM and just study interview problems. When you apply to Big-N you’re still considered a new grad until a whole year after graduation. Getting into Big-N is easy. You just need to study LeetCode and practice interviewing.#I think that just depends on your tolerance for that type of work and how good you are at setting boundaries. It’s easy to fall into the trap of - clearednewgrad is an expert in X air-gapped region, just have them handle all of the deployments and high severity events for us and related teams.If you don’t like it, you can always transfer to Retail, where there isn’t a need for cleared engineers.#Believe it or not, not all devs need or use StackOverflow.#[deleted]#What’s over there? OP can live in Baltimore lol#Sounds about right. The security in that building is pretty tight.#Are you suggesting someone actually wants to live in Baltimore...?#Theres just nothing there, most live closer to DC than Baltimore but it's about half way in between each

cmu;dbzigm;1569962639.0;/r/cmu/comments/dbzigm/an_unpopular_opinion_calling_palantirs_oncampus/;An unpopular opinion: calling Palantir's on-campus recruitment activities to end at Carnegie Mellon is wrong;For those who don't know, Palantir Technologies is a private American software company that specializes in big data analytics.^(1) Palantir's controversy emerged as reports alleged discovered Palantir was working with the US government, specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), to produce analytics software used in deportations.Outcry over Palantir's involvement has resulted in a number of college campuses withdrawing their agreements with Palantir to recruit students during on-campus events.I have recently read multiple social posts calling for Carnegie Mellon to end its involvement with Palantir.I believe this is a well-intended argument. But Palantir is absolutely not the only company guilty of using its technology for morally-gray purposes, and is therefore undeserving of the particular derision it has gained.If Palantir contradicts CMU's open inclusion initiatives by cooperating with ICE, then Facebook and Google should similarly be banned from career fairs given its involvement with American (and foreign) surveillance programs challenges CMU's commitment to freedom of expression as an academic institution.By similar logic, Apple's role in the toxic extraction of rare-earth metals for its devices, which are heavily non-reusable themselves, is also deserving of scrutiny and exile from campus.I have not even mentioned the defense companies and agencies that frequent the TOC.I am not arguing that Palantir is not at least indirectly complicit in questionable government-related activities. However:**TL DR:** If a company's mission does not appeal to the campus community, then it would suffice for the student to decide for herself. This quasi-moral elitism is ultimately unproductive and is nearsighted when the technology industry collectively shares far greater sins.*This is a throwaway account*1. *Wikipedia*;"Your post is a textbook example of [whataboutism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism) Solid work. If people want to express their disagreement with CMU allowing Apple or tech companies involved in defense contracts to recruit on campus, then they should be allowed to do that also. They're NOT obligated to take a moral stance on every possible controversial issue in order to express their views on a particular one that they care about. Stop gatekeeping.Not only is it not *wrong* (whatever the fuck that means - not really sure how expressing an opinion with sound moral foundations is wrong), but students' ability and willingness to challenge institutional support (even if said support is only tacit) of entities they feel don't align with the university's stated values and their own values is critical to maintaining a spirit of intellectual freedom on campus, and also aligns with higher-level democratic ideals.What IS wrong is implying that students should remain silent because you personally disagree with them, and then using a slew of logical fallacies to support your shit argument.As an alumnus, this post is incredibly embarrassing to read.#Hey, I work for Facebook, and used to work for Google.  In both cases, if the government shows up with a legitimate warrant, they get the data they requested, which seems sane to me.  I don't know of any cooperation beyond that, and that seems pretty darn reasonable to me.  What am I missing?#There is nothing morally gray about Palantir.  Palantir exists solely to recruit high achieving people who under normal circumstances would never work for Palantir's clients because what they do is morally reprehensible.  Palantir techwashes their activities and hides behind the free food and perks.  By treating Palantir like a normal tech company, we are complicit in their propaganda campaign.#Ya this is literally just astroturfing, my money says OP is a Palantir recruiter#Do you dislike Palantir to the extent that you don't want to work for Palantir? You can achieve your objective very easily -- just don't interview for the position.I'm not sure why it has become popular to force your views down **other people**'s throats.#[deleted]#at the job fairs they never say how they discriminate against asians either lol#>Solid work.  >  >(whatever the fuck that means -   >  >As an alumnus, this post is incredibly embarrassing to read.These aren't really what one would call top tier retorts either. I don't agree with OP either, but you're throwing at them unnecessary amount of anger and that would hinder good discussion. > not really sure how expressing an opinion with sound moral foundations is wrongAre you thinking that the use of wrong here is meant as ""morally wrong""? I interpreted it as ""logically wrong"" (maybe OP can clarify here). You can have morally well intentioned motives but still cause detriment to the world from a ""wrong"" understanding or idea on how to execute those good intentions. >of entities they feel don't align with the university's stated values and their own values is critical to maintaining a spirit of intellectual freedom on campus, and also aligns with higher-level democratic ideals.What IS wrong is implying that students should remain silent because you personally disagree with them, and then using a slew of logical fallacies to support your shit argument.Again, I don't know if OP is arguing against this. One can agree that someone has the right to free speech while also viewing their opinion is wrong. This might also be a misinterpretation of ""wrong"". Furthermore I don't see OP calling for a silencing of the opinions, just, again, that they're not logical.#You have not refuted my argument.There should be dialogue regarding the companies that attend CMU's career fairs. But forcing everybody to adopt your own perspective by pushing for the school to eliminate a company's presence on-campus is another.Feel free to argue for the recruitment privileges of a company at CMU, but why can't I do the same?Selectively pruning the activities of Palantir without recognizing the flaws of other companies does little to advance the University's ethos.#Great response! I wholeheartedly agree.#Palantir builds systems for mass surveillance and sells them as a service to any government agency that wants them.  They are not turning over data when compelled to, they are actively aiding and in some cases pushing government agencies towards more mass surveillance.  https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kx4z8/revealed-this-is-palantirs-top-secret-user-manual-for-cops#Google has been [accused](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-google/googles-work-in-china-benefiting-chinas-military-u-s-general-idUSKCN1QV296) of helping China's military in areas like censorship.I don't think it's enough to just look at which companies obey warrants. I feel we should be more thorough.#PRISM#[deleted]#Preface: I am deeply suspicious of deplatforming as a practice, particularly in universities.  But I think if I were to present a steelman of the argument in this case, it might go something like this:Take as an axiom that Palantir's business is a net negative for society.  They serve, almost exclusively, customers pursuing ends which are destructive to the welfare of society and the common good, vis a vis erosion of civil liberties and privacy, the decline of the fourth amendment, parallel construction, etc.  This might be regarded as similar to pollution or another externality of a more physical business, which would typically be cause for the state to limit, penalize, or provide restitution to those harmed (even under libertarian political thought, externality-management and the problem of the commons are reasonable-if-thorny subjects for government).  Unfortunately, in this particular case, the state is Palantir's primary customer, and therefore no state action is forthcoming.  One's choices then are to do nothing, to ignore the toxic business (and to not give them your resume), or to organize against it.  The action which produces the best expected outcomes in the future (minimizes damage to the civic commons) is organizing to destroy the business.  What means of damaging the business are all of effective, legal, and ethical?  Threatening their supply chain of talent by pressuring university administrations into denying them access to careers fairs is certainly legal, and possibly effective/practicable as a means of degrading Palantir's effectiveness, and consequently reducing the damage that they do.  So I suspect the sticking point for you and I would be, is this ethical?  Is this consistent with the function of the university, as a place of free discussion of ideas?  And I think the consequentialist might argue that the civic side effect of damage to university norms of impartiality is either a) in net, smaller than the damage Palantir does to the body politic, and consequently a worthwhile if regrettable trade, or b) welcome, if it makes universities a more effective means to apply pressure to unethical people and companies (whether this results in the destruction of the legitimacy of the institution in the long term remains to be seen).#Yeah, not sure why more people don't think this way.#Source?#This is a sensitive issue and perhaps I have not articulated myself as gently as I intended.Should students discuss the activities and nature of the employers on campus? I think we can definitely all agree.But I think the dialogue regarding Palantir's removal from career activities is disproportional to our treatment of other companies. I am explicitly mentioning *other* firms in my original post to highlight that, if we were to treat all companies and weigh all their controversies equally, then many popular employers on campus would not be here.Palantir is not the only company 'guilty' of a government contract. Just one example, the DOD's $10 billion cloud computing JEDI contract is currently being hotly contested by Amazon and Microsoft, and there's an appreciable chance that the resources of that project will head towards a questionable field.#>These aren't really what one would call top tier retorts either. I don't agree with OP either, but you're throwing at them unnecessary amount of anger and that would hinder good discussion.If you're unable to engage in constructive discussion because you perceive anger in a written response - well, that sounds like a personal problem. Also, none of those statements express anger. Sarcasm and derision, maybe - anger, no.&#x200B >Are you thinking that the use of wrong here is meant as ""morally wrong""? I interpreted it as ""logically wrong"" (maybe OP can clarify here). You can have morally well intentioned motives but still cause detriment to the world from a ""wrong"" understanding or idea on how to execute those good intentions.It's neither morally wrong nor logically wrong. There's nothing ""logical"" about picking a cause and fighting for it. Students are protesting Palantir because they are standing against their partnership with ICE. That doesn't mean that they need to also protest other companies engaged in different practices that may be morally abhorrent.&#x200B >while also viewing their opinion is wrong.Sorry, but that makes literally no sense.#> There should be dialogue regarding the companies that attend CMU's career fairs. But forcing everybody to adopt your own perspective by pushing for the school to eliminate a company's presence on-campus is another.What do you think this dialogue should be, if not students protesting Palantir recruitment events?>Feel free to argue for the recruitment privileges of a company at CMU, but why can't I do the same?If you actually have good-faith moral concerns about Google/Facebook/etc.'s work with the government, feel free to protest that (I bet there will be other people who support you). But when you only bring that up as a reason for why people shouldn't protest Palantir, it does not come off as a good-faith concern.#They were probably asking about Google and Facebook’s involvement#I was one of the folks responsible for turning on HTTPS, 100%, at Google  Search hasn't worked for people in China since then, which is unfortunate, but user privacy was deemed more important than more users.  After I left, I was glad to see employee protests against possible changes to that policy, and it looks like those protests worked, near as I can tell.For being more thorough, the way to fix things is regulation, but most national governments are busier pushing for encryption backdoors than they are for user privacy, which is broken at least three ways.  :-/I'm curious to know what Google is accused of doing that would help censorship  the linked article didn't go into any detail there.  I've been gone awhile, and don't know the current lay of the land, but... significant work on that front would be a little surprising.#Google legally \*has\* to comply with court orders, or it's out of business.  I've seen Google avoid choices that would make things worse on that front, and believe they're acting ethically.That feels a league or two different than Palantir's business model people are unhappy with.#Take a very close look at [google.cn](https://google.cn)  it's a single-image, and a click on that redirects you to a secure site in Hong Kong.  Without a VPN, you're not searching Google from China, as currently implemented?   -)#Thanks for the reasonable, polite and thoughtful counterargument. It's very important for people who disagree to talk about it without being rude.Here's where I specifically disagree:> One's choices then are to do nothing, to ignore the toxic business (and to not give them your resume), or to organize against it.True. But here the definition of ""organization"" gets a little tricky.> The action which produces the best expected outcomes in the future (minimizes damage to the civic commons) is organizing to destroy the business.The majority of people who work for Palantir don't believe, presumably, that its activities are a net negative for society. (Anecdotally, I know at least a couple of people who work there -- they are no more evil than anyone else I know.) If a candidate doesn't take that axiom for granted, do other people have the right to stop them from expressing their preferences? Wouldn't that lead to a tyranny of the majority?>  So I suspect the sticking point for you and I would be, is this ethical?I agree completely with this analysis. I would just err on the side of freedom. Clearly there are some people who believe that working at Palantir is not ethically problematic -- in principle, in my eye, that's all that should be needed to allow Palantir into the career fair.I will admit that in real life doesn't always match up to my libertarian worldview. Some people are just sociopaths. Others are ethical people but lie about their ethics. Still others are honest ethical people but have no other career opportunity except for an unethical one. And in all these cases, we do have to make a judgment call  there has to be some threshold for which companies to allow in, it's where to put the threshold that varies. I'd rather the threshold be at ""human trafficking organizations"" rather than companies like Palantir.# https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/26/palantir-racial-discrimination-lawsuit-asians-peter-thiel#I agree with everything you just said in this response. There was only one sentence that I disagreed with which may have caused some confusion for others:> But Palantir is absolutely not the only company guilty of using its technology for morally-gray purposes, and is therefore undeserving of the particular derision it has gained.Specifically, ""Palantir ... is therefore undeserving of the particular derision it has gained"" can be interpreted in by some as meaning ""We shouldn't deride Palantir since we don't deride other companies"". I'm not sure if that is what you meant, but that's how I read it.Did you mean to use the word ""particular"" to mean ""We shouldn't deride Palantir *uniquely*""? Because that I (and probably a lot others) would agree with.I would argue that Palantir is definitely deserving of criticism... *along with other companies.*#Correct me if I'm wrong as I am trying to distill the info in the thread, but youre mainly disagreeing with the protestors' reasoning for kicking Palantir off of campus -- that Palantir is doing some controversial work with ICE. You think the protestors should be applying this same scrutiny for other companies like Facebook, Apple. Given this reasoning, I think your argument needs polishing to say that protestors should be looking basically at all companies. Because you can cut anything a certain way and find something that someone doesn't agree with.  It's not just Facebook or Apple.  I think I would even go far to say that all for-profit companies are doing something ""bad"". Someone somewhere in the line is paying for it-- that's how companies make profit. You can take all of companies which make/sell things and realize that manufacturing accounts for half of all greenhouse gases. Also side note, virtually all device companies use rare Earth metals, not just Apple. (So it's actually maybe only us to blame that we need so much shit all the time every year.)Ideally this scrutiny should happen and everyone do their own research but I think the reality is that CMU is largely democratic and don't support what Palantir is doing with ICE. So the protestors are just people who see something they don't like and are protesting it. Yeah, they could do more research into every company, or just not do so.To sum, I agree with what I think you are trying to say, but unfortunately I think reality is that no one is going to give all companies the level of scrutiny that should happen. I think people on the thread might be confused with your arguments thinking you condemn freedom of speech or something#>But I think the dialogue regarding Palantir's removal from career activities is disproportional to our treatment of other companies. I am explicitly mentioning other firms in my original post to highlight that, if we were to treat all companies and weigh all their controversies equally, then many popular employers on campus would not be here.Yes, and I addressed this explicitly in my first paragraph. Maybe you should go back and read it again. No one is obligated to protest every employer that recruits at CMU that may or may not be engaged in distasteful practices in order to get some kind of ""protest pass"" that allows them to focus on the one they care about.The entire premise of your post is fundamentally and irreparably flawed.If you care so much about Palantir staying on campus, maybe you should entreat the administration with counterpoints that convince them to allow that.#>If you're unable to engage in constructive discussion because you perceive anger in a written response - well, that sounds like a personal problem. Also, none of those statements express anger. Sarcasm and derision, maybe - anger, no.I don't think sarcasm is really constructive either. When people ask questions in good faith, it's best to answer them in a way that doesn't lead them down 1) cognitive dissonance or 2) feeling discouraged from asking more questions. I assume OP is asking in good faith  I'm at least willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Just to be clear, I'm also not for banning sarcastic or mean-spirited comments either (you can respond how you please) but I will still discourage it.>It's neither morally wrong nor logically wrong. There's nothing ""logical"" about picking a cause and fighting for it. Students are protesting Palantir because they are standing against their partnership with ICE. That doesn't mean that they need to also protest other companies engaged in different practices that may be morally abhorrent.First of all, did you mean to write ""illogical""? Second of all, I totally agree, but you're barking up the wrong tree (me). To reiterate from my earlier comment, I don't agree with OP either. I'm just making sure their arguments are understood so we can critique them in the proper way. I don't *think* OP was saying the protestors were acting immorally, but rather illogically. You said, and I quoted, ""not really sure how expressing an opinion with sound moral foundations is wrong"", which made it sound like you thought OP was saying that the protestors were morally wrong. I then said I didn't think that was what OP was saying. So just be assured that I'm just trying to clarify OP's statements and making sure OP's points were being properly understood. >|  while also viewing their opinion is wrong.  >  >Sorry, but that makes literally no sense.I encourage you to look into this idea. The idea is famously summed up by a quote by Evelyn Hall: ""I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"". It's better to have a free-speech society with ideas you may disagree with than to have a society with no free speech. Is this what you mean to say makes no sense, or was there something else about my argument(s) that you thought made no sense. If you could elaborate, it would be appreciated.#Don't apply to Palantir if you feel uncomfortable working there. I don't mean to sound overly blunt, but how else can you reasonably protest a company without intruding on the agency of others?#True, that’s a fair point.#> The majority of people who work for Palantir don't believe, presumably, that its activities are a net negative for society.I used to work for a defense contractor, and it was a funny mix of ""no actually the mission is good (even if the commander in chief is kind of an idiot sometimes  management, am I right?), and it's unfortunate that the public doesn't know the details (or only gets the selected details that leakers want them to get rather than the whole picture) because if they did they would agree"" and ""*shrug* I don't care very much, the money is pretty good and the work is interesting"".  And I'm reasonably sympathetic to both of those positions  if you can find a job that you enjoy where the money is alright, and you're not literally strangling puppies, that's pretty close to winning at careers.  Second-order effects are pretty well unknowable in sufficiently complex systems like global information economies, so I don't spend too much time worrying about them before they arise.  Fix bug, this causes new bug, fix that bug, repeat.  The story of human civilization.In any case, yes, I certainly agree that it is possible to believe in good faith that what Palantir does is ethical.  But I did not want to argue that particular point, because the deplatforming seemed the more interesting question.> Clearly there are some people who believe that working at Palantir is not ethically problematic -- in principle, in my eye, that's all that should be needed to allow Palantir into the career fair.CMU's a business, though (this would be an even more interesting discussion for a public university).  If a business declines to transact with a particular customer (Palantir) due to PR fallout and potential future lost revenue (alum donations, probably), is there anything wrong with that?  Was the presence of Palantir in particular at the TOC a sales point for CMU student-customers, such that revoking that presence causes a false advertising sort of situation?  I do think that if activists started trying to run off all of Northrop, Boeing, NSA, *and* Palantir, the whole defense sector, then I would start to be more concerned about that.Under ""there is no bad publicity"", this whole thing may have in net driven students *to* Palantir, anyway.> I will admit that in real life doesn't always match up to my libertarian worldview.I used to be a libertarian, and know that feeling well d:#Thanks. I honestly wasn’t sure what to make of your initial comment without anything backing it up. I appreciate your posting this article.#If they really want, people can still apply to Palantir through non-university means, so their agency is not being intruded on even if Palantir is banned from campus.In this case, I think protesting is especially effective, since Palantir recruits heavily from universities like CMU. Public opinion clearly did not change their mind about working with ICE, since they renewed their contract in August after media attention. Pressure from their own prospective workforce would potentially have a greater effect. Even if they aren't banned from campus, protesting is still a good way to draw people's attention to a significant issue they may not be aware of- I have a friend who applied to Palantir and didn't know about their ICE contracts until I told them. I think this is an opportunity for CMU students to potentially have a seriously good major impact (ending the Palantir ICE contract) by protesting.#> CMU's a business, though (this would be an even more interesting discussion for a public university). If a business declines to transact with a particular customer (Palantir) due to PR fallout and potential future lost revenue (alum donations, probably), is there anything wrong with that?That's absolutely fair to state, and businesses should be making these decisions even if the thought process is a little cynical. I personally suspect that the gain to CMU by allowing everyone to enter whatever career stream they want is greater than the loss due to students not feeling ""connected"" with the university, for want of a better word. But of course, my personal point of view holds no weight  it's the university board of directors who must make this decision. Not me, and not the protestors. The university can listen to our opinions, I suppose, and the activists are making theirs heard -- but I suspect there's a silent majority that just can't be bothered to argue *in favor of* Palantir, and their opinions deserve to be taken into account as well. This is a more general point -- focusing your attention on those who shout loudest is always a risky thing because it rewards and incentivizes activism for the sake of activism, and soon enough you have a campus full of people who think that holding placards is a better use of their time than learning about the dining philosophers problem.>  Was the presence of Palantir in particular at the TOC a sales point for CMU student-customers, such that revoking that presence causes a false advertising sort of situation?Honestly, I'm not too sure about the particulars of this situation. You're right that false advertising should indeed be taken seriously. But I'd imagine this problem is very easy to solve, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was already implemented -- just put up a poster next to the career fair stating that the opinions of people there don't represent the opinions of the university.> I used to be a libertarian, and know that feeling well d:Who knows, I might not remain one for much longer (I certainly wasn't one ten years ago). I try to keep an open mind."

If any of you guys know about it please tell me, I am still an undergrad and would like to learn more uses of the discipline.;"I double majored in sociology and computer science, yes this is possible.

Also, there are programs that already exist that do this sort of hybrid study and I would recommend looking into that route rather than gluing together a degree like I did.#I'm guessing you've read Savage and Burrows ""The Coming Crisis of Empirical Sociology"", but in case you haven't it deals with the problems sociology faces by not having access to corporate big data sets.

Aside from the - now probably dying Digital Methods - it's good to have ways to analyse and gather data.

And machine learning: automated content analysis, textual analysis, image classifiers and so on, are all pretty cool.Work-related, knowing coding and QN methods opens many doors.Bonus: if you are in certain institutions and thinking about academia, being the only sociology person with a CS background opens lots of doors, people will follow you at home to get help, offering co.autorship (never hurts).#I talked to one professor who received his PhD in immunology/biology and then got his post doc and professorship in psychology and his advice (that he received from someone with a similar track) was to develop expertise or get your PhD in one field, and then apply it and get your professorship in something else.

analytics;d6fa0f;1568905331.0;/r/analytics/comments/d6fa0f/analytics_without_numbers_viewing_products/;Analytics without numbers: Viewing products through users’ eyes; Here are two things you’ll hear a lot from product teams:1. A lot of data is needed to reduce uncertainty and get an accurate picture of users’ needs and behavior.2. People working on products understand and know their users well.The above statements are misconceptions, and in both cases, the reverse is true. In this post, I will discuss how analyzing user behavior without big data (debunking the first premise) will help us avoid the unpleasant outcomes of thinking you already know your users (debunking the second premise).## First misconception: We need a lot of data to reduce total uncertaintyImagine an infinite sized pool of black and white balls. Your task is to find out the share of white balls. Initially, you are in a state of complete uncertainty. How much data do you need to find the answer to this question?If you take 100 random balls and calculate the proportion of white balls, then you will know the answer with an accuracy of ± 9.8%. If you add another 100 balls, you will increase the accuracy of your answer to ± 6.9%  Add 200 more balls—you are up to ± 4.9%. Another 600 balls—up to ± 3.1%. With 9,000 more balls, you will achieve ± 1% accuracy.Did you notice that the first 100 balls gave us a lot more knowledge than the next 100, and going from 100 to 200 balls had much more impact on the accuracy than the 1,000-10,000 range?Let’s keep this in mind and move on to the second misconception.## Second misconception: People working on products understand and know their users wellThe second misconception assumes we understand the products we are working on.The truth is, we don’t.We are always looking for ways to close the gap between the product model we envision and the actual product we build. To do so, we try out new tools and approaches, communicate with users, conduct experiments and analyze data.The goal behind all of these activities is simple. We want to improve our understanding of the product and users, to find opportunities for growth and development, and to increase the proportion of the right decisions we make.## Viewing the product through users’ eyesWhat was this long introduction about? I want to introduce you to a method that will allow you to learn a lot about your product. It is very simple:*Take a few users and observe how they use your product.*No, you don’t have to conduct an interview with these users. There’s also no need to calculate the metrics that characterize their behavior in the product. We literally need to take a specific user and monitor how she interacts with the product throughout her entire period of usage.How can you do it? If you already have event logging set right in the product, it is very simple:1. Select the group of users you want to study (you will need different users to get answers to different questions).2. For each user of this group, create a sequence of all the events they generate, including the event parameters, from the time they start using the product.3. You will end up with a sequence of events for each user in your product. You can divide this sequence into separate sessions for convenience.You can also do it with the help of Amplitude’s User Look-Up tool.Now you have everything you need to view the product through the user’s eyes. Look at the sequence of events and start analyzing it. Take notes along the way.You will observe what the user does while going through the onboarding and afterward, what difficulties she encounters along the way, at what point her first session ends, whether she has experienced the product’s value by that time, when does she retain and how long it takes her to do so, and much more.Now, let’s go back to the first misconception. Studying a small number of users (50-100) with this method will help you find out the following:1. How and why do people use your product?2. What problems do they face at different stages in your product?3. How does the actual usage differ from what you designed the product for4. Which users tend to stay and which tend to leave? What are the differences between them?Another benefit of doing this type of analysis is that it helps you come up with a bunch of hypotheses that you can test/validate through data analysis, experiments or user research.## Case studies of analyzing user behavior through session analysisThe method we described above solves a wide range of tasks, so it can be considered quite universal. Here are a few cases where session analysis proved to be very useful.## Yandex Maps RedesignRedesigning any old popular service is extremely risky. It’s very important not to break any of the existing use cases in the new design.A few years ago, I worked on the redesign of the web version of [Yandex Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.yandex.yandexmaps&hl=en), the most popular online map service in Russia and CIS market with over 30 million users. Due to the complexity and scale of the task, we wanted to make sure we understood thoroughly all the use cases our users have. To do that we decided to manually analyze user sessions.We selected a few hundred random users, manually examined their sessions, categorized them, and wrote down our observations. The result was a table of existing product use cases and their popularity.You might argue that this approach was not necessary, that we could have just calculated the share of people who used the product to build routes, those who checked the traffic jams, or searched for organizations, etc. But these quantitative indicators would have hidden a lot of useful and critical information about the way people solve their problems with the product.It turned out, for example, that different people used the same features and solved similar tasks in completely different ways. And it was something we should have considered in the new version of the product.In the process, we made a number of unexpected discoveries. For example, it seemed obvious to us that in the task “to find an organization on a map -> find out how to get there,” users build a route directly from the organization’s snippet (see the orange arrow in the screenshot).In reality, however, it turned out that only a small percent of users did this. Most users simply copied the address of the organization and pasted it in the routes tab to build a new route (see the green arrow on the screenshot).I don’t know any other way to learn about such unexpected twists in users’ behavior other than tracking their events and examining their sessions. And the fact that such behavior exists entails many questions. Creating routes directly from the organization’s snippet is clearly easier than copy-pasting its address in the route tab. Why are users missing it? Is the organization’s featured snippet overloaded with data? Are users not noticing the button?## Finding problems in the first versions of [King of Thieves](https://www.kingofthieves.com/)When creating products, we usually assume people are going to use them in the “correct” way. We design a product in a way that helps users discover its core value as soon as possible.Surprisingly, “silly” users always do everything in their own way instead of the way we anticipate. This is exactly what happened with the first versions of King of Thieves.King of Thieves is a mobile game in which you have to break into dungeons and steal treasures and gems. You can play the game in single-player mode, but the true value of the game is in its competitive multiplayer mode. The key feature of the game is to steal gems from other players to become the wealthiest thief. At the same time, players must defend their own treasures and build traps in order to stop rivals from stealing their treasures.King of Thieves turned out to be a very successful game—but the launch of its first version was a disaster.The game’s retention was a poor 26%. Most players left the game shortly after they tried it and never came back.To understand the reasons behind this, we looked at the user sessions in the way described above. We wanted to understand what was wrong.The core value of the game was in its multiplayer mode. When creating the game’s onboarding, we assumed that we would show how the game mechanics work in the first levels of the single-player campaign, and then players would switch to the multiplayer mode when they were ready. That’s exactly why we made a huge red multiplayer button after all!But it turned out that most users simply went through the single-player levels without ever paying attention to the multiplayer game mode. After some time, they got stuck in a difficult level, or just got bored, and abandoned the game.There were few who switched to multiplayer, but in most cases the players saw no difference from the single-player mode. The opponent either had no gems to steal, or he did, but when players completed the level, they weren’t awarded the gem, even though stealing gems from other players was part of the game’s core loop.After analyzing the sessions of several hundred users (the sessions were very short, so it didn’t take us too long), we figured out that less than 10% of users had a chance to experience the essence of the game in their first few sessions. Those who grasped it were much more likely to keep playing the game.Of course, we should not forget that at that point, this was just a correlation—it did not necessarily mean that players kept playing the game because of that experience. Nonetheless, it was a good starting point, and the hypothesis that walking more users through this experience will improve the metrics was worth testing.We could have probably found this problem through metrics alone: We would see that a very small percentage of new users try the multiplayer mode. And in most cases, those who do try do not steal gems from their opponents. But we didn’t know exactly what we were looking for or when we needed to pay our attention. Perhaps everything was fine, and players simply didn’t find the mechanics of the game entertaining enough.We launched a new version of the game in which we walked players through the multiplayer mode in the onboarding and also made sure that when players attack a dungeon, there’s a gem for them to retrieve and they actually get it after completing the level. As a result, the game metrics significantly improved: Day 1 retention soared from 26% to 41%, while Day 7 retention increased from 9% to a healthier 20%.While examining the sessions and looking at the product through the eyes of our users, we found the stark contradiction between what players experienced and what we wanted them to actually experience.## Optimizing the Funnel of adding a flight in [App in the Air](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/app-in-air-best-flight-tracker/id527299553)Here is a wonderful example that Bayram Annakov shared in his [blog](https://medium.com/@bayramannakov/funnel-analysis-investigating-why-users-drop-6cccbbe41968#.d6c2vl77l).App in the Air is a mobile app that keeps track of your itineraries, boarding passes, and frequent-flier programs. The application helps ease the frustration and complexities of finding and managing flights.However, the product team found that 30% of users of the App in the Air didn’t add a flight after opening the app screen where they were expected to do that.The problem turned out to be pretty trivial, as has been the case in many similar problems. The users would search for the name of the airline or airport they sought in their native language—the search worked only in English.The funnel demonstrated that 30% of users churn at a certain step, but in order to find out why, it was necessary to go one level deeper and look at what exactly people were doing at that step.After making sure all the app’s localized languages were considered, the churn rate at this funnel step declined from 30% to 5%.## Personal sales firstY Combinator co-founder Paul Graham has an iconic essay titled “[Do things that don’t scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html).” One of the things Graham mentions is that founders should personally find their first customers and help them onboard into their product, serving as a tutorial manual in a way.Why? Because it gives the opportunity to look at your product through users’ eyes, which in turn allows you to quickly find points your users don’t understand, where they find the maximum value, and what is and isn’t important to them.It is true that this can be labor intensive and not fun at all. It is way easier and less stressful to look at a drop in the funnel at a specific step than to seek and observe lack of understanding in real people to whom you’ve recently spoken about all the advantages of your service.Personal sales work great for B2B products. In fact, session analysis is a variation of this approach that is more suitable for B2C products (though it can also work for B2B). Now you can select the users you need and study them in detail, like in the previous example with App in the Air, where users reached the screen where they could add a flight, but for some reason didn’t complete the step.Moreover, you can also contact these users personally later and ask them the questions you have in mind. This will make the overall picture as complete as possible.## Pros and cons of analyzing user sessions manuallyAnalyzing user sessions will give you a more decent understanding of how people are using your product. This is not an abstract knowledge of how various popular features and conversion of various funnel steps work, but a vivid idea about your users’ paths within the product from the moment they start using it until they either churn or your service becomes a part of their life.Another bonus of such an analysis is making it easier for you to work on new things in the product. Having a clear picture of the current paths of your users inside the service, you can better predict how and at what stage the planned changes will affect them. This increases your chances of making the right decision.Unlike using metrics, this method loses much less information along the way. But, as is usually the case, it also has its disadvantages. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to compare different versions of the product based on the manual session analysis method. You will have to analyze too many of them to obtain statistically significant results. In this case, metrics, cohort analysis, and A/B tests will help you.## Summing it upMany think that analytics is all about numbers and mathematics. In my opinion, analytics should help you to understand your product and answer questions you have about it. Numbers and metrics can help with this and solve some problems rather well, but you should not limit yourself to them. For some tasks, other approaches, including manual session analysis, will do a much better job.Try examining the session of 50 users of your product. If you don’t find anything interesting, you’ve only lost a few hours of your time. However, and I can bet on it, you will probably find a few pleasant surprises.;Fantastic text! Thanks for sharing! We have a lot of good experience with manual usability tests, really a lot of good surprises!#[removed]#Thanks a lot! Glad you liked it :) Want to read more posts like this?

gamedesign;d4xrw5;1568622448.0;/r/gamedesign/comments/d4xrw5/dream_job_game_economist/;Dream job: Game Economist;Hello everyone,  I'm an Economics student, currently in South Korea as an exchange student. I really want to end up working creating and regulating in game economies but I'm not sure how to start learning about it and include that knowledge in my CV so I can find an internship related to that. I'm taking a few Big Data courses and I plan to read a couple of books I've found about the subject, but I'm looking for more resources and even courses to take about in game economies. Also I would like to create or participate in any project that needs economy design.   That's why I'm asking you guys if you have any advice on how I can learn and start aiming my path towards my dream job.;Managing an economy isn't an entry level job, so assume you'll start out as a general game designer. Which means you should be able to do all of that work - writing detailed specs, implementing and testing config, understanding player behavior, critical analysis, and so on.Get a job at a company making free-to-play games. They have the most complex in-game economies that need the most work. Tell the beleaguered designer working on the economy that you want to help. You will immediately have econ work to do. It will be a lot of 'How does the game feel if X cost Y instead' type things. Be dedicated and play it and get all that feedback.Once you're there, start breaking out the analysis. Look at shortages or surpluses of resources in live economies, things like that. Use real observations and your own theory and experience to craft something new as a systems designer on a new game. Congratulations, you are now an experienced economy designer. I'll look for you at the secret meetings and teach you the handshake.#Make the best economy out there! Because the ones out there in current large scale games now are pretty bad.#In addition to the other comments I would like to add, just create one. Design an in-game economic system on your own. The subject you're working with is one that doesn't need to change a lot between games if it is designed well. Depending on configuration your system could work for simple and complex games. If you built a good economic system that developers could integrate into their games you could make a good amount of money just selling it yourself making it available for purchase on different game engines. Or, put it in your portfolio and you're sure to catch the attention of many companies.#All games have economies. Every single one. Make sure not to ignore others that don't have money/items/etc.#I'm actually approaching this issue from the other side. Instead of creating and managing economies, I'm more interested in observing and characterizing the behavior of MMO markets to see how well they match up with expectations. It's still humans managing scarce resources, so it *should*, but I don't want to know if it should, I want to *know* if it *does.*I'm working with one of the professors on a very basic research project looking at commodities like low-level metal ores and seeing what the actual market data says about how people choose to buy/sell. I decided to do it this way because it was a very direct, practical, hands-on application of economics to something I already have a fair amount of knowledge about.That said, I have little to no interest in working the actual game development side of things. I'm older, I have a family, and game dev just isn't a lifestyle I'm interested in anymore. I'm more interested in the academic research side of things. If I'm really lucky, I might eventually get paid to do it, we'll see.#Thank you so much for all this information. It kinda clears the path that I want to take even though I still have many questions I don't even know how to formulate.  You say I will start as a general game designer. That's really intimidating to me because of my low knowledge on game designing in general. I'm decided to learn whatever it takes though.Also I thought I could reach this job by starting as a Data analyst or something like that then move to design. Do you think that's also another way to get there? Because I can see myself applying to data analysis internship/job but game design will be tougher because of my lack of knowledge and experience.#Hahahh yea right, I feel like they are more focused on squeezing the player than trying to balance it#That would be great and a good final project for my major, even though I doubt I can create something that no one created before and earn money from it. Sadly I'm not a genius. Good news is that one game developer contacted me thanks to this posts and it's likely that I will be participating in that project, so there's that!#There is another path through analyst and/or associate product manager roles. Typically that’s less actual design of the economy and more reporting on it to let the designer know what to change, but I’ve known one person who worked in that way. At the end of the day PM and GD start merging together as you go up the ladder.You should still work to understand design fundamentals, however. You can’t get away from economy design being a subset of game design, and usually not enough for someone’s full time job.#I worked as a data analyst as well as software design and I would say it would definitely be a valuable skill to have if you want to design something like an economic system. One of the things I used to design was finance software. There's a lot of really complex interaction, it's mostly the data and then rules based around that data. It's not a simple thing, as I'm sure you can imagine. Getting experience with that kind of data based thinking by working in a professional environment would be a great way to learn, also money. If you're into economics I imagine you would probably have a pretty good aptitude for it as well.#I long for a game with a well thought out, established economy in a game. If i ever make the game i want to make someday ill see where you are because I need someone who cares like this haha#That's wonderful, I hope it turns into a great project!You don't always have to create something that no one else created. Looking at things that already exist and trying to improve them, or just putting your spin on them, is just as important. A little unsolicited advice. Every time you're playing something and you feel a twinge of annoyance because you would have done something differently, write it down.#I really need to think this through. Analyst seems a safer path but it's less likely that I end up being a game economist. Anyway, thank you so much for the insight, I will work hard!#Definitely. I've been looking at job offers and all of them require to have knowledge on data analysis, but on top of that I also need to know about game design. It feels like a lot to learn, a huge mountain to climb, I'm kinda overwhelmed to be honest. If my first job is not about game design it will be about data, that's for sure. Thank you so much for your words!#Please do! Don't hesitate to contact me if you ever need someone like that. I hope one day you can create the game you have in mind#Hey I know we talked awhile back but I had a few questions for you on fantasy game economics if you are up for it.#Sure! I'll send you a dm right now
cscareerquestions;d9hcci;1569490926.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d9hcci/how_to_find_a_job_in_the_machine_learning_field/;"How to find a job in the machine learning field that ""helps"" the world";"I'm a computer science grad student and really passionate about machine learning and everything around it. After working very passionately on my master thesis the last few months I am now 100% certain that I want to start a career in that field. It is just so fucking awesome and I really love doing this kind of work.My issue at the moment is that I don't want to work at a company that tries to create yet another ""AI-driven, fully immersive, scalable, cloud-driven big data xyz solution"" that will completely change a certain segment in the consumer market. I'd really like to do something that kind of helps the world, maybe going into the direction of humanitarien or environmental problems. This doesn't mean that I want to be a philantropic data scientist working for some charitable organization, but I think I want my job to have at least a little bit of a ""bigger meaning"" behind it.Any tips how I could find something like this? Also, would you recommend going into research/doing a PhD before working in the machine learning field? I have nothing against scientific work. Btw I'm from Germany and would like to stay there! :)";"Work for healthcare. There are many firms that are trying to make this happen. I would start with Flat Iron and then look for like companies trying to solve issues like curing cancer solutions. It's philanthropic and there is money to be made in it.#Chemometrics is a decent corner.  Analysts use PCA, random forests, regressions, neural nets etc to build automated routines that can correctly classify, identify, quantify and authenticate samples measured through spectrometers and other instruments.  This can be used to ensure medicines are uncontaminated, that food is healthy, that blood sugars are within bounds and a variety of other ""confirm it's safe and good"" applications.  The ratio of (evil + corporate greed) : (actual human goodness) within the field is pretty reasonable I find.Also, there's a lot of it *in* Germany.  My favorite application scientist, with whom I work remotely every day, is based in Germany.  Yeah, a Ph.D. is pretty much required in this field.  All of the candidates I see have their Ph.D. — I was just getting a new one setup yesterday, doing image processing on OCT scans.To find such jobs, I'd do periodic searches including terms like spectroscopy, application scientist, chemometrics, medical devices, biomed, biotech etc (as well as machine learning and so forth).  Browse the listings of healthcare, pharma, and medical device companies (both big ones like Bosch or Philips and small ones).  Go on LinkedIn, search using keywords similar to those above, and find profiles of people with jobs and careers like you'd want to have, then reach out to them  see where they've worked, and check the job pages of those companies.  If you don't find enough similar profiles on LinkedIn, start by reaching out to a handful of technical recruiters.  Those people are usually connected to tens of thousands of engineers, who are themselves connected to all the scientists they've worked with, and suddenly you'll start finding more ""hits"" in your searches.Also, to make yourself more appealing, look up various commercial analytic tools used to process data, download the free / demo versions, play around with them, and add them to your resume.  This doesn't mean you're an expert, it means you've used it some and can find your way around the product.And of course make sure you're conversant with the various Python heavyweights (numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, pandas etc), and R doesn't hurt.  (My German guy sends me everything in R, and I have to translate it into Python.)\* PM me and I can connect you with some folks to start with#I admit that I am very pleasantly surprised by the responses in this thread!#Optimization for packaging / fuel usage at a place like amazon. Or data center electricity optimizationThose things are hugely wasteful and the companies stand to save billions if they can optimize#Health data science. It's how I feel that my work in AI isn't just being used to sell more ads.#Healthcare, remote sensing (eg. satellite image processing to predict climate change patterns), Neuro science research also has a lot of MAD scientists and professionals working in it. There are definitely plenty options. You just need to identify in which one you'd like to make a difference and then go nuts.#Work in wildlife conservation--An idea I want to produce: solar powered research cameras which identify species passing through wildlife corridors.Work in renewable energy--* Finance: Predict & capitalize on renewable energy trends --> make renewable energy trading profitable for yourself/your investors* Electricity Networks: ""Smooth"" the supply of renewable electricity (this is just a random idea) by predicting when and where energy is needed.#>Also, would you recommend going into research/doing a PhD before working in the machine learning field?Yes. At least in the US, PhD bigotry is huge in the field. There's so little interesting work that anyone will actually pay for  what there is (and it's usually high school statistics, dressed up to seem more impressive than it is) is jealously guarded. I left a PhD program after 1 year (health problems) and even though I'm 36 and know more AI/ML than many PhDs in the field, and even though I'm smarter and more skilled than the $500k/year hotshots (there are plenty smarter than me, but they suck at marketing themselves and are nowhere near $500k) I *still* deal with that shit. Get your degree. You'll be thankful you did-- especially if you want to vie for the tiny number of jobs that actually help the world. (Most corporate work is some variation of hurting people for money.)Keep in mind that if you do something that's good for the world, you're likely to earn 1/3 of what you would make working for the bad guys. Evil pays  good is strapped. That doesn't mean it's not worth doing  once you have enough to survive and live reasonably well, money is worth a lot less than personal happiness. Plus, there's a lot to be said about working for and with decent people-- and your odds of that are better if the work itself serves a positive social purpose.#So I can’t really answer your question, but I am also looking at getting into the same area as you. I have some experience with ML and would be down to brainstorm / collab on some stuff.#Saved this post.Metoo thinking about same.I.e. using knowledge for community.#you mean flatiron health?#There’s a company working w/Google called “Boulder AI” that has some solar-powered cameras w/embedded ML that’s used for traffic & also animal tracking in N. America - don’t know if they’re in Europe. https://www.boulderai.comSolar power in the woods depends heavily on the location - animals often prefer tree cover & plus somebody has to haul panels out there & install them in addition to small trail cameras (which already have pretty great battery life). Lots of govt agencies using stuff like that, but they don’t pay very well, and in Europe for OP oddly there are almost no jobs in that field - just lots of volunteer stuff. Wildlife conservation in general doesn’t pay well at all, but you can do some cool stuff. Predictive modeling for species, habitat, impacts of climate change, etc. Power companies might be a good place to look for paying jobs, esp in Germany w/such a heavy focus on renewables. Or maybe stuff like modeling traffic flow or public transport to maximize fuel economy or something? Again, govt work, or maybe some shipping/logistics company?#“Most corporate work is some variation of hurting people for money”Excuse me what? What kind of non sense is that lmao#Makes sense that such things wouldn't pay well.""Pay well"" depends on the demand within the economy.Wildlife conservation stuff... isn't very economically based.  It's funded differently-- not by profits, but by research grants.But, I was mostly responding to the question/prompt of ""helps the world""Thanks a bunch for sharing that link with me!! Awesome!Great points at the end there re: things that pay well.  Civil engineering, traffic flow monitors, etc.  I saw a company on AngelList a few months ago based on that stuff--  a couple recent civil engineering graduates working on an electronic device to help track traffic flows.#Some people make money in positive-sum ways: they discover new sources of value by doing things no one ever thought of. Others make money by taking it from someone else: cutting jobs and increasing their salaries, creating monopolies and raising prices, finding ways to do business cheaper at some externalized cost (e.g., pollution).There's a much larger third category of people who'll ""just"" grind, but neither programmers nor executives want to be in that category, because your income is rate limited by your capacity to work (which fluctuates year by year, and goes down in old age). The reason people go to school is to be eligible for something better than grind work.Very few people are smart enough or will work hard enough to be in that first category. It's much easier for a corporate executive to steal money somehow-- say, by firing a bunch of people, paying himself a bonus, and expecting the remaining workers to ""ramp it up"" in the ""leaner"" (more fragile, more likely to experience catastrophic failure). The long-term effect is negative for everyone but him, but he expects to be promoted away from the mess he caused before anyone notices, and usually, he gets away with it. It wasn't his fault that the remaining workers couldn't execute his ""brilliant vision"".When you do corporate work, you're signing up to be in some executive's private army. Whether you get fired or promoted has nothing to do with how good you are at what you think your job is  you'll be advanced or punted based on your perceived loyalty to management. And, most of these executives don't have good intentions. They're warlords who steal, and your job is to either to be part of the stealing process, or ensure they don't get caught."

bioinformatics;dc2wmd;1569977613.0;/r/bioinformatics/comments/dc2wmd/computer_science_bs_accepted_to_georgia_techs/;Computer Science BS - accepted to Georgia tech’s OMSCS program but thinking about bioinformatics instead?;I was accepted to Georgia techs online masters program for computer science which has some classes for health like big data for health analytics and stuff but I’m thinking about making a full move out of computer science to bioinformatics or similar field.I was recently diagnosed with a rare syndrome and while reading more about it, I find the field of biology still has so many problems left unsolved and that’s the kind of work I like doing - software engineering is sort of stale because the problems of web development are boring. I get that software engineering is going to make me more money right now but the general environment is uninteresting and somewhat toxic. The stuff I’m interested in is Ehler’s Danlos Syndrome and the RCCX theory.Maybe I have a case of the grass is greener. Is it worth moving into this field? Are there any introductory courses I can take to see if I like the information? Would it be worth just getting the MS in CS over trying to do a MS in bioinformatics?;"My two cents as a biochemist making the move into bioinformatics: once you get into the details of something it always has potential to end up stale. I could describe the work you do with computers in the same way you describe biology, big fancy problems that are exciting and need solved. The reality of science in general is that progress is slow and hard, it's not a bunch of eureka moments one after the other about world changing problems. Additionally, bioinformatics is basically computer science applied to biological problems  if I were to do it over again I would get computer science degrees and take some biology classes. If your goal is to make a difference, look up research papers in both areas and see what interests you more. If your goal is to have a job and a good life, know that bioinformatics is much less marketable and that comp sci can make a difference in plenty of areas. All of this is to say that you should stick with comp sci and take some bio classes to see if you truly like it.#[removed]#I also have EDS and am interested in bioinformatics because of it, but I also find the topic itself interesting and would be happy working in the field whether I could secure a position related to my disease or not. I think this is what you need to consider from a career perspective. If you can't get into a position where you're working with genetic data related to EDS, will you still be happy with your work? Can you still see it as worthwhile in itself, along with it being a potential springboard towards your goal? If yes, do a full switch. If no, I'm not saying it's a bad idea, but I am saying it's worth thinking on further.#Check out the Broad and Wyss Institutes over in Boston. If you live nearby or moving is an option, they have positions for Software Engineers who work with biological data sets. If not them, look around for bioinformatics jobs that you would be interested in working in while you are doing your MS. From the work you do, you'll figure out if you like it pretty quickly. You can work there while you complete your MS online, and when you finish you'll be well positioned to move to another Software Engineering role, or to go into Bioinformatics. If you decide to go into Bioinformatics, you can continue with a PhD, or move straight into an industry role after your MS in CS and bioinformatics experience.#I would recommend taking a few bio classes to make sure you're interested in the subject. At least an intro course and genetics. You should be able to find those courses for cheap at your local community college. Chances are that you won't end up working on your syndrome in particular, but maybe there will be another problem in the field you could work on that interests you.I think it's great that you want your work to make a difference, and bioinformatics is a possibility to do that  but there are many ways you can do so. You could even use your web development skills at a company that has a mission you believe in, no need to learn a completely new skill set. Another way to make a difference is to use the extra money you are making from your lucrative career to donate to causes that matter to you.For a more analytical approach to making a difference via your career, check out [80000 hours](https://80000hours.org/).#You may want to consider a PhD in genetics/comp bio instead. A masters wont get you super far in research and you would likely need a PhD eventually anyway. You could also look into working in a lab as postbac as another option too.#Is your undergrad in CS? If so, the bioinformatics route can be a good one provided you’ll be able to do that research you’re interested in. If not, stay in CS.#To quote my supervisor: Don't waste your timeI was wondering the same thing as you, to the point asking my supervisor if I should do another master 2 in Biology to fill the hole in my biology knowledge. What he gave me is a state and a lecture on how I will learn on the job, I should concentrate on what I do best (informatics) and all if I get to PhD there are plenty chances to fill in those hole. Furthermore as my intern progress, I find that I learned way more and more efficient by actually talking to the biologist I was collaborating. So I guess don't worry too much, there are plenty of jobs for (kinda) pure computer scientist in this field.#I am a current MS Bioinformatics student at GA Tech! I’m graduating this December and staying here to start my PhD in January, also in Bioinformatics.Plenty of my colleagues were CS majors with no biology background, and they really seem to love it. Also the program is only 1.5 years, and I already have friends in my cohort getting jobs both bioinformatics and non-bioinformatics related (data science jobs mostly). If it’s something you’re interested in pursuing but not sure if it’s what you want to do, I’d say go for it because it’s such a short program and the skills you learn are applicable to plenty of other fields not biology related if you change your mind.If you’re concerned about cost of the degree: if you do research in the lab, you have the opportunity to earn a GRA award which provides a monthly stipend, and a HUGE reduction in tuition. With that I’ve only had to take out $25k in loans as an out of state student, which is nothing compared to plenty of other programs. Plus it looks great on your resume.I also have a friend in the program graduating this December that received a $130k salary job offer, so good salaries for MS bioinformatics degrees are definitely out there!#Yeah, that’s probably the way I’m going to look at it. I wonder if I’m just having a case of “grass is greener” and wonder if the dip in pay is worth it.Looking around me, the bioinformatics are getting around 50-70k and I’m at 100k with only two years in software engineering.#That’s interesting to read! There’s a bunch of underlying studies for each gene individually but your BS trigger is that she’s saying those genes linked together cause a lot of stuff which is probably false?#this comment gave me a science boner#That’s a good point. Is there a good recommendation of a MOOC or something that can tell me about the field generally? Maybe something on Coursera or something?One reason of the switch is because I would rather do work that’s helpful or at least feels helpful rather than the meaningless stuff I’m doing now.#Unfortunately I’m not near the area. I’m in San Diego so there’s places like Illumina near me. I can check to see if they any such positions open.#Dont get me wrong there's definitely really cool work to do in bioinfo, but I look at what you computer scientists do and feel like the grass is greener as well. Easy to get bogged down by the details. Regardless, bioinformatics masters are generally super expensive. For context I skipped on an ivy league comp bio masters for a state school data science masters due to cost (10x cheaper).#I don't have any personal recommendations (I'm still pretty early in my journey lol) but I'm interested to see what other people say. I'm sure there's a TED talk out there too for a higher-level overview if you can't find a MOOC. I definitely understand the desire to want to contribute to a beneficial goal rather than like...making corporate software or website maintenance, which does have a different feel to it. It's also worth looking into potential downsides of bioinformatics, not because I know of any but because the logical step after discovering a reason for a disease is developing treatment, and that's where insurance and pharmaceutical companies get involved. How comfortable will you be with any discovery you are a part of after it's out of your team's hands? I might be blowing this out of proportion since big data has a lot of applications, but a stricter bioinformatics program is going to narrow down your career focus and you should be sure about it.#Ah that's good, San Diego is another big bioinformatics hub. Just make sure you apply for the software engineering positions and not the ""Research Associate"" type positions and the compensation should be comparable to whatever you're making now. Good luck."

node;dbz9m4;1569961589.0;/r/node/comments/dbz9m4/full_stack_front_to_end_or_just_react_injected/;Full Stack front to end or just React injected?;I'm trying to convert a full AMP (Apache/MySQL/PHP) application into a more versatile and specially FASTER framework.Obviously I've looked into a few solutions but it seems that Node+React (and other libraries and extensions) can achieve that.I don't mind rewriting the app to get front to back node+react.**The App**it's like a social media platform with thousands of members and interactions with each member profile is what is slowing it down.  As it is now, each member profile is loaded with Ajax calls that get results back (json) from the DB but we need to edit those records and when dealing with a big data table it gets frustrating to just apply a filter or change a state of an element.Questions:   1. Is re-writing the whole app in react+node is the best solution for scalability and future-proof?  2. Should I just introduce React as the Rendering framework of my php returns and keep my structure as is?  3. Is there a better combination if I need to build such an app?Hopefully I will get a better experts answer than from the youtube tutorials i've been watching lately about this.Thanks!;What is causing the slowdown in your current app? Have you identified it as an issue in the ajax calls or is it the fundamental structure of your data?#Sounds like db read and write is the pain point. React/node won’t necessarily fix that. You use react for ui state management and node for concurrency and JavaScript goodness. Perhaps getting your db in order is the way#Sounds like you have significant tech debt, and a rewrite should seriously be considered. You'd have to compare the total cost of fixing or maintaining the current system (including e.g. customers/revenue lost) to the cost of a rewrite. Almost certainly a rewrite will be better for the business over the long term, IF executed correctly. Of course, large software projects have a high failure rate so you have to assess that risk as well and decide whether it is worth it.One possibility is that there is a simple fix for the slowness that was overlooked. That would be the most ideal case and certainly a possibility that should be investigated.#Also to add to my previous comment, my DB has a lot of relationships between multiple tables and I make a lot of JOIN calls when loading data with php-MySQL queries#\> As it is now, each member profile is loaded with Ajax calls that get results back (json) from the DB but we need to edit those records and when dealing with a big data table it gets frustrating to just apply a filter or change a state of an element.Sounds like you want to use a React/GraphQL architecture. But if you're unfamiliar with this, you will struggle to rebuild the carbon copy of what you currently have.Good luck.#AWS maybe not the best for now in terms of API deployments.  The app is robust and works very well for a smaller number or records....that’s my issue.The calls to the dB are too many to count at this pointThat’s why I can’t just repay him...it would probably take me the same time to rewrite with a proper framework.Therefore I’m asking is MERN the way to go or should rewrite it with a proper MVC php framework so that it can stay as close as possible to what we currently have ?#Mainly the data is all over the placeIt has been patched and restructured but never have I really changed the architecture of itIt is a custom framework in PHP not using MVC and with many libraries injected over the years :(It’s like a rotten house with windows broken and doors are busted.  It’s a house alright...but it should be just demolished and rebuiltThat’s where I’m at ..#This plus a rewrite does introduce new issues and no additional value to the end user.#Yeah but here is an example of what I mean:page.php Has multiple functions representing the different views requested by clicking on the navigation.function load() {Has all the markup and docs representing the ui of this navigation menu item}In the <head> the $( document ).ready() calls a JavaScript function  (pure js) The js function makes an Ajax call to another php file containing a loop through the database query result needed and spits out a json data back to the jsIt’s good to mention that this php while loop has also multiple calls to the database but other tables needed to get the end result data string for jsonThen the js function loops through the result of the ajax call and populates a return variable as a table with rows and columns and values from jsonThen it modifies the doc container in the php where the table should render.———————-When the user clicks on a row (generated by iterating the json values from the Ajax call previously made ) a modal window appears and then we do multiple Ajax calls with the specific record data they clicked on.———————When the record data modal can also be edited.So when the user wants to edit one of the fields of this record, another Ajax call is fired to display the edit modal (on top of the initial modal) then when saving the new value another Ajax call is fired to do the update to the database...And so on and so forthAs you can see pretty much anything loaded is with Ajax calls to various php methods and all the returns are handled by jquery elements modifiers by $(‘#aDomElementId’).html(‘’)This is just one function it has multiple intricacy of code crossovers to do other functions Like I said, very convoluted.That’s why I’m asking here is rewriting in react node will simplify my app yet keep it as complex as I need it to be ?#Thanks for the insight. I actually tried everything.  It's simply that my code and ajax calls to the DB are convoluted and cause many memory leak issues.  The question is, for such app, MERN arch. is good enough and scalable enough ?I'm really considering a rewrite at this point.I keep patching...patching...and adding code it has become a dev nightmare to just go and add a new small module of feature.#If you're just trying to improve the performance then you need to identify which queries / operations are slow. From there you can use Google to figure out a solution to that specific issue. For example if a DB query is slow, make sure your DB is indexing any columns that are used for joining, sorting (order by) or filtering (where). Maybe you can use caching to avoid running a slow query for every single client. Figure out exactly which blocks of your code are slow and then look for a solution specifically for that.If you decide to rewrite, before you decide on MERN stack or whatever else, you should first re-think about your data structure, is it relational? MongoDB is nice but if your data is structured and uses joins often then it might be better to use a relational database.Keep in mind the purpose of the rewrite- if it's mainly to make your life as maintainer easier then try to pay close attention to details like naming conventions, how your files are organised, how re-usable your components are, etc. Enforce code style rules with eslint or similar.Write tests even though it is annoying, your future self will be happy you did. Use continuous integration tools to make sure your tests pass before you can deploy to production. Use git or some other version control system for your code. You can version control your database structure with migrations (knex in JavaScript). There are lots of other devops tools you can explore.Front end is an entirely separate decision, you can use any front end (react, Vue, angular, svelte, etc) regardless of what back end or database you pick. React is probably the most used in new projects these days but they're all good enough to rely on.Lastly, just a word of caution- In my experience, rewrites are usually a lot more work than it seems. It's easy to convince yourself that it will be easy, but it's almost never as easy or as quick as expected.#As a very shallow analysis: It sounds like you need to rework your data, but doing that in your current system would be a nightmare. Converting over to a well designed MERN stack would be a prelude to reworking your data.&#x200B I recommend you sell it as a 2-phase project. Phase 1 is the rework, Phase 2 is the data enhancement.&#x200B It's very possible that Phase 1 will result in zero improvements to the users, but it is a necessary prelude to phase 2. Make management aware of that from the start.#This kind of imperative, convoluted state management is the problem React was invented to solve. There will be quick wins in adopting it but probably other problems to contend with.You don’t have to rewrite everything. Try using react for a small component. A label for example. However there is a learning curve as react uses many functional programming concepts which need grokking if you are unfamiliar with it. After your time investment in grokking these concepts, you may as well rewrite everything.#I think MERN is pretty future proof at this point if implemented correctly. Another option is to use AWS to create your APIs instead.#Thank you [bossmonchan](https://www.reddit.com/user/bossmonchan/)!I do lots of testing. However it's easy to miss something when you have such a convoluted code and data stricture.  I have the entire code on a git repo  My data does use multiple joins but that can be worked aroundit's still a simple Member database with different access permissions and roles.  I think this can be done even without joins but it wouldn't be pretty.  That said, I'm looking into MongoDB to see if it can be a good fit.  If not I can still use MySQL with MERN.  Maybe I need to know if MERN can be applied to my app and will it make it more robust and scalable or just make it prettier with the front-end bells and whistles?
analytics;dc1n5w;1569971650.0;/r/analytics/comments/dc1n5w/analytic_applications_and_market_overhype/;Analytic applications and market overhype?;[deleted];"There's a good post which I cannot locate, but I'll attempt to paraphrase.  Artificial Intelligence is a misnomer, it's certainly not artificial, and it isn't sentient, but it's exceptionally good at performing tasks (like chess or go).  The first thing that you do before a task is to make a decision.  In business this happens thousands of times a day.  When someone decides what to do, or decides direction for an entire department, division or company - those decisions are made from a blend of data, experience and inuition.  But making data centric decisions based on tasks means that those decisions (which are tasks themselves) can be automated, augmented and have a better outcome.  This reduces risk and the labor of decision making.  If you can avoid launching the next crystal Pepsi, acquiring AOL or simply reduce the amount of time it takes to analyze your indirect spend, marketing asset performance or financial modeling - you can save the company millions. A few examples I've worked on include propensity modeling, segmentation, pricing optimization, causative factors for declining metrics, optimization of collateral, sentiment analysis, part failure and a host of supply chain issues.  There's definitely too much hype and most ISV SaaS products shouldn't use it as a marketable product feature - unless that is their category.  Some plucky dev embeds a lone regression in their SaaS app and suddenly, ""now with advanced data science.""  PM if want more details.#I think there are 2 different questions here... 1 about big data, which another poster answered, and the second about specific statistical techniques. I’d check the data science subreddit if you want answers to the second as they’re probably better suited to answer that question.#I hear both of these all the time, too. At every company and meetup (bc I go to a lot of data meetups). I think people see it as a magical solution - “we’ll just toss all our various data pieces into a blender and it’ll spit out amazingly accurate predictions that will earn us greater profits/market share.” Except you need a team of people, adequate time, and a specific goal to get these great predictions, and even then you’ll still make mistakes because your analysts can’t tell the future.#This is absolutely true.  Most company leaders in a corporate setting don't have a fat f\*cking clue that they are talking about when it comes to machine learning and many technology topics for that matter.  Many of them were in senior leadership positions when the tech revolution hit and they were able to maintain their power without advancing their skill set.  This is why I had to get out of corporate america.  It's a good tool to get paid well and save up some money until you can start your own thing but just be aware that bullshitting and bringing nothing in terms of hard skills to the table is common among corporate managers.  Success in corporate america is about&#x200B * accidentally being born some combination of tall, rich, and good looking* staying in one role until you win the war of attrition to get promoted and then immediately leaving to parlay your promotion into a better one - rinse repeat* wearing nice clothes and maintaining an immaculate appearance and the ""corporate attitude""* buzz word stuffing in front of the boss* throwing peers and subordinates under the bus for personal gain* writing 3 ambiguous posts a week on LinkedIn that have the word ""leadership""&#x200B Now to answer your question about a concrete example of machine learning in action.  The best example I've seen was an Azure machine learning platform overview where we examined a fictitious regional bank with a plethora of historical loan data.Using this data we configured the machine learning platform to examine certain data points within the historical data and connecting them to to historical loan decisions to train the web service.For instance we might look at:&#x200B * gender* age* household income* net worthFeed that data into some of the pre-built algorithms and tell the model what the final loan decision was - approved or not approvedWith enough data and training the model can be fed a new combination of gender, age, household income, and net worth and be able to predict with a percentage confidence what the loan decision should be.Example 1* male* 32* 80,000* 100,000Decision *approved* (90% confidence in decision)Example 2* female* 35* 80,000* 0Decision *not approved* (70% confidence)&#x200B Machine learning is often built into web services that can be fed defined data points like this and then spit out a result and degree of confidence.  If the confidence is too low a human might have to make a manual review of the full application.The complexity often lies within not constructing individual building blocks like the example above but in the data sanitation, training  of the algorithm, and the building of a ""nueral network"".Data sanitation might be something like converting all the null values to 0 and then grouping them into buckets.  For instance the algorithm will have a harder time predicting exact income levels because the historical data for the exact income level will be limited.  However if you run scripts to clean the data and *group it into $10,000 increments* the available data *per income level* is greater and the algorithims can predict with a higher degree of confidence.You also don't want to rely on a single algorithimthic result.  You might run the same data through 2-3 different predictive algorithims and then average out the decisions and the confidence degrees.  This reduces the risk of some funky data creating false postive and false negative results and make the machine learning web service overall more stable.  This daisy chaining consolidating of results is called creating a ""nueral network""Knowing the appropriate level of data consolidation and algorithimic risk averaging is why we need data scientists to train these things.Hope that helps! Stick with it, it's going to be an exciting field.#Your example points out in problem in training on historical data - built-in prejudice. I don’t know if banks actually use sex to make loan decisions, but Amazon has this exact problem when they tried machine learning in resume reviews. Because women were less likely to be selected historically, their algorithm was biased against women.#You sound like you've been in this field for a while, so I've got a question:. The more I delve deeper into this area, the mathematics and statistics starts to get overwhelming really fast. Did you run into such an issue as well? If so, how did you work with it?#Totally, ML helps you make the same decision again. For ethical and now legal reasons you shouldn’t use discriminatory fields like this in a real model.#I have not been in the field. I’m just a bit of a technophile and have just done some reading on it and attended a couple talks to stay abreast of trends. I’ve been a dev though and know the programming aspect of machine learning and how it fits into an overall software application and they are closely related. From what I saw there wasn’t much need to actually know the math in detail since most of the platforms use pre built algorithms. I didn’t sense that you needed to be able to write the algorithms yourself but rather understand the pros and cons of using various algorithms and the statistical basis behind the regression. The Azure Machine Learning platform looked pretty well documented though.I think you said you were a student. Don’t worry so much about learning everything today. Repetition and practice will make anything seem easy. One thing that’s never steered me wrong in programming is to go one level deeper that the textbook. Try to understand why something was invented and the problem it solves rather than the actual mechanics. Once you get that the mechanics get easier and future learning in the same discipline becomes easier.Machine learning done right is a deep cross discipline field and is not easy. If you really want to become a master and stick with the field look at developing your expertise over a 10 year horizon rather than in 6 months. It pays off.#Thank you! I'm not a student, I work as a data analyst right now. I'm really interested in machine learning though, so o tend to read about it a lot on the internet#Check out Azure machine learning or the AWS version. You can create a working model and tinker with the platform for less than $50!#Sure, I'll definitely have a look. Thanks for the info!"

Don’t forget the Software Assurance annual costs as well (ballpark 25% of initial price). Lots of options and things to consider. I love it - please keep us posted. I love stuff like this and really enjoy hearing “Latest update” and “Lessons learned” out of these.edit: Here's a good example of top end Enterprise-grade hardware for SQL: http://www.tpc.org/tpch/results/tpch_advanced_sort.asp?PRINTVER=false&FLTCOL1=ALL&ADDFILTERROW=&filterRowCount=1&SRTCOL1=h_priceperf&SRTDIR1=ASC&ADDSORTROW=&sortRowCount=1&DISPRES=100+PERCENT&include_withdrawn_results=none&include_historic_results=no#You can find the licensing information in the below guide. At high-level, you only license (Standard or Enterprise) the cores for SQL Server Master instance in BDC. Depending on the standard/enterprise, the number of cores translate to BDC cores that can be used to distribute across your cluster. BDC also requires software assurance.[https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/6/0/66078040-86d8-4f6e-b0c5-e9919bbcb537/SQL%20Server%202019%20Licensing%20guide.pdf](https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/6/0/66078040-86d8-4f6e-b0c5-e9919bbcb537/SQL%20Server%202019%20Licensing%20guide.pdf)#We want to deploy a big data cluster of 8 nodes with 4-8 cores each.

digimon;d8hpwn;1569296335.0;/r/digimon/comments/d8hpwn/considering_the_popularity_of_pokemon_do_you_guys/;Considering the popularity of Pokemon, do you guys think Digimon as a franchise is severely mishandled?;"Hey. Let me first say that this is not a shit post on Pokemon. I love the both of them. Each has their own charms. Still, I have a few thoughts and would love to know what you guys think.I guess I will introduce myself first for you guys to know where I am coming from. I am a casual but long time Digimon fan. I LOVED watching the anime series as a kid and teen, and spent considerable amount of time on the 3 original Digimon World games on PS1, especially Digimon World 3 and I am currently playing Digimon World Re:digitize on emulator. So I was wondering has there been any interesting developments regarding this franchise and search for it on Google. Results should come up plenty, right? But no, finding information on this was ... hard and scarce until I remembered Reddit, and here I am. I am not posting to ask for info though. I can piece together tidbits here and there.Well, onto the titular topic. Pokemon as a franchise is simple, I guess, which I think is one of its strengths. You don't have to know anything to begin playing one of the games and literally aside from the settings, all the games are the same. You just beat the gyms, catch them all and go along with the storyline. This tremendously help young fans generation after generation to get into the franchise. Digimon, on the other hand, is much more complicated. Setting-wise, you can literally craft any environment (steampunk, fantasy, science-based, etc.) you want, because it's digital and as long as the idea exists, that setting should be somewhere in the digital world. The number of ""mons"" along is already crazy high, over 1000 of them and among them, the different factions like the Royal Knights, 7 Great Demon Lords, the Olympos XII, the Celestial and Holy digimons, etc. are after different things. These factors, including human's interventions can craft a very complex and expansive narrative. But I have never seen enough thought put to utilize these assets to good use. Each anime series is like a bubble of itself, except the first two, and the games are really fragmented with no coherent stortylines and world-building, except for the recent games on PSP (Vita) and PS4. Imagine a Digimon world but massive open-environment with nuanced storyline that take into account all the franchise has to offer, it would be one (or more?) of the best game and anime based on the potential of storyline and world-building. If I can get someone like Kevin Feige to work on the Digimon franchise, I would.All the ranting aside, I am just sad that the Digimon franchise is so underutilized while its potential has always been massive. Off course, my knowledge of the franchise is limited and I may be wrong in writing this so please correct me if I have been missing anything, but the idea is still there.Well, that's all folks. I would love to hear what you guys think regarding this subject and also what you guys would do if you are in charge of the franchise?My idea would be planning a re-introduction of appmons, making them a emerging subtypes of digimons that come in power recently because of the smartphone advancement and culture, which invades and threatens the whole order of the digital world. This can spawn an anime series and games which follow different characters as they are looking into different aspects of this ""war"". Like, you can have one storyline following a protagonists who are trapped inside the digital worlds and the other storyline following detectives or researches looking into strange events resulted from this war from the human side. And we haven't even talked about Big Data and AI, imagine what that would be like for the digital world.Edit: You know what? An idea just sparked in my head. Imagine ... Social Network Overlord-mons! They are literally Overlords because they are in control of so much information, data and how everything flows.";"I think the place they majorly messed up was the US localisation. Other then that, other countries did a good job keeping the original feel intact, which is also the reason why Digimon is far fondly remembered in Latin America and Asian markets than US. Their games have been good for the most parts, and in the last few years, way better than Pokémon, atleast in terms of quality. But yeah, Digimon didn't reach its potential as a merch factory mainly because it had no singular vision as a whole. It reacted way too quickly to trends after Tamers. Fate is doing better, and the fact that lore of Infinite universes cannot be handled properly is not really backed up properly, considering franchises that are doing it better.#Pokemon is the single highest money making franchise of all time. It's higher than stuff like Marvel, Mario, GTA, Call of Duty - whatever you can name, Pokemon has made more money than it. So if you wanna go that route, *everything* is mishandled compared to Pokemon.#I just think that pokemon had better campaigning in the beginning and more money thrown at games and merch#Pokemon is just boring and every game that comes out AND the anime of it is 97% the same as the previous season of pokemon, it might be my personal taste but I hate repeated stuff yet pokemon and scooby doo are the most famous shows despise their uncreativityIt's just that people's tastes are shit :P#Digimon was never really that popular to begin with.In my whole school,back in andventure series it was only me and my friend tha we used to watch it .For the others it wash just a cheap pokemon imitation. I dont know how was things in Japan but the way they tried to push the show in the west was not flattering. The whole aggressive anti-pokemon thing while being in the pokemania period turned a lot of people away.Also no one talks about the games exept the hardcore digimon fans. I love digimon but i have never played a game and never felt to.I will probably try the collection when it comes to Switch.#Yeah, look at Marvel and DC, they craft their franchise in a way that you can explore endless possibilities and they have a main universe acting as reference point. There's no reason Digimon cannot do that and unify all the different stuffs they have explored.#Yeah, I know. Expecting Digimon to do as well as Pokemon is almost unfathomable. But if you read my post, it could definitely be handled better, you know?#Hey, it's called personal taste for a reason right?#Awful take#Yes, you should play the game. It's awesome. I have Chaosmon, who is basically a god, following me around asking for meat lol.Also, thanks for the info regarding the show's initial marketing. Where I live they literally have had no presence whatsoever and I only knew of Digimon because my dad used to let me rent CDs to watch and I got curious once.#Well, Digimon is doing fine. Better than fine, you could argue it's doing the best it ever has. Tri made a shit tonne of money, Cyber Sleuth sold ""a record 800,000 copies"" (which seems to imply its the best selling Digimon game *of all time*), we've had 5 new Vpets in the last 5 years, we have two confirmed video games coming in the not too distant future, there's a currently on-going manga series, and in 2019 alone there's been 50 new Digimon created. Then there's plenty of new figures/merch from the last few years that pretty much always seem to sell out. Just because it's not as high as Pokemon (and uh... nothing is) doesn't mean it's dead, Digimon is one of the most popular multi-media franchises out there.#Yeah, I agree on the fact that it is doing well and making money. The things you list also put things in perspective for me a little bit. I think my point still stands though. It is not about the fact that the franchise is doing well or how it compares to the Pokemon franchise, but the fact that it is still underutilized with so much lores and world building and possibilities. I guess I just want it to go as big as possible, you know what I am saying? This merely is a reflection on my part and I understand others may not think the same.#The thing about lore is just that Digimon isn't one big universe, Cyber Sleuth itself stated there are infinite amounts of universes that all co-exist. Making lore for... all of that is outright impossible. We do our best a a fandom to collect everything together on the various fan run wikis, but for the most part things canon to one series will be non canon to another and so forth. some may not like that but put it this way: it means Digimon can never run out of content. Bored of the current? well there's a bajililon more universes with new lore you can go to in just Digimon itself."

The offer quoted in your OP is a scam.The currency should alert you, Barcelona is in Spain. Spain uses Euros (€).As for pricing, the MBA in Supply Chain Management is €8,400, or €2,940 with a scholarship.#>not going to include the link as so it does not look like spamThe link would really have been the best indicator - if it's not located on the official university website, it's going to be a scam (that does not mean that the university is a scam, but rather that someone sells you something that does not exist).#It seems legit, poor, but interesting nonetheless. I bought it yesterday on a lark and got a response within 12 hours with login information.  They did ask for a resume or CV when I registered. The Spanish site is [eneb.es](https://eneb.es) and the English site is [eneb.com](https://eneb.com), so it's probably a for-profit school in the US.  The system is based on Moodle which is a very old learning management system.  The modules are poorly translated English, so a little difficult to read.  The MBA curriculum is modeled after a typical US MBA curriculum only with fewer case studies than one would find in a stateside school. The virtual library has real texts, but of course you have to read them online.   I think for someone interested in learning about business it's not a bad deal.  On the other hand, it might be hard to say that one has an MBA after finishing the program.#Here is a website link for  ""Tuition fees of online MBA degree programs in Spain""  [https://www.eligemba.com/online-mba-degree-programs-cost-spain/](https://www.eligemba.com/online-mba-degree-programs-cost-spain/)ENEB is appropriately listed.  This is a third party publication that verifies the program.  When you click on the link you will get three website options:  Spain, Portugal, and English.  Spain has a es suffix,  Portugal a pt suffix, and English a .com suffix.   If you Google The University of Cambridge you will see that they do not use the standard edu suffix ([https://www.cam.ac.uk/](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) ). Some have raised questions about that website difference.   Not all European schools use the .edu suffix, many are related to country (see uk - above).  Why the .com in the U.S.  - I presume it was an efficient marketing tool as the would not have to apply for the .edu suffix. Then there is a question of accreditation.  Most European countries have departments or ministries that recognize schools - thus they don't have the same type of accreditation that exists in the United States.  In the U.S. the regional accreditors dominate, but there are specific accreditors (TRACS - for Christian post-secondary schools) and even a national accrediting body - the Distance Education Accreditation Council (DEAC).  So for European schools - appropriate governmental recognition is the accreditation equivalent.    If so recognized, clearly legitimate and legal degrees. There are then questions regarding how one uses an international degree in the United States.  To determine equivalence,  there are credential evaluation organizations/service providers.  For example, Texas lists such agencies: [https://tea.texas.gov/Texas\_Educators/Certification/Out-of-State\_Certification/Foreign\_Credential\_Evaluation\_Services](https://tea.texas.gov/Texas_Educators/Certification/Out-of-State_Certification/Foreign_Credential_Evaluation_Services) . Now regarding some particulars about the program at ENEB, each course follows a course module format and includes a ""case study,"" a standard business education model.  Some have questioned the number of cases, per course, for a graduate level program.  I have not begun my program, so I cannot comment on that aspect of the program.  Some have questioned the LMS. The LMS (learning management system) is Moodle.  Some universities/colleges use this LMS. Here is a limited list: [https://www.eclass4learning.com/colleges-universities-use-moodle/](https://www.eclass4learning.com/colleges-universities-use-moodle/) .  It is a legitimate LMS system and generally has lower cost to operate.    I did inquire about their programs.  I learned that their use of Groupon is a marketing strategy.   The price is perceptually unrealistic to sustain an institution. Yet, if you want to market your institution can you buy direct advertising (i.e. Purdue Global) or you can market through a service like Groupon.   Regarding the development of an online course and program, once it is developed it can be delivered at a much lower price point.  For example, the college I teach at has paid faculty to develop courses for approximately $2500 each.  Since we are a two year institution the total developmental costs for a degree would be $50,000 (20 courses, 3 credits each for a 60 credit associate degree).  Thus creating an online program can be cost effective. Regarding instruction, faculty at my institution are paid either by student or course, depending on enrollment numbers.   I suspect much of the ENEB program has automated assessment, with the exception of the case study.   So the ENEB program would be cost effective at their tuition rate at the website, still cost effective with their scholarship rate, and not cost effective at their Groupon rate  unless your desire is to gain international exposure or additional revenue, even if a marginal amount.   Regarding admissions, they require documentation of the completion of a bachelors degree to generally enroll in the program   but they do allow you to start the program in your junior or senior year - that is complete some of the graduate courses - but you must finish the bachelors degree before you can complete the masters degree.  Some US schools allow taking limited graduate courses while an undergraduate.   Regarding quality, that is a perceptual matter. There are average MBA and masters degree programs at any number of schools in the US.  Just felt the need to post some comments about the opportunity at ENEB and in a context regarding concerns raised within the discussion thread.     Dr. Bruce LeBlanc, EdD, MPA, MA, MA, MS, MAPAC#Yeah - I bought it and it’s legit :)#I am more worried about the accreditation. It seems that the Groupon is legit. It also makes sense IMO that it is cheap since they are really just giving you access to training modules. The online format potentially has very little overhead. In America some colleges are ""Accredited"" by essentially made up accreditation authorities, therefore a joke.# This is too good to be true. There's this college with more than 50.000 students and they charge 7600€ for their courses....   Don't you think they mean monthly payments? I mean... if they include the whole master's degree with a university title for only 249 €... I'll take 10, please! LMAO#110% scam. The GRE test just to get into graduate school is over $200 and you truly believe you can get a legit master's degree for $249?#I’m monitoring this, so anyone who actually bought it: keep us advised.As to “why”...Even if it’s just access to the material, I think it might be worth $250. I don’t need the accreditation...just the knowledge.

Just have a look on that link :)Hope it helps.#I saw it on Living Social this week. Wondering what kind of laugh it would get from hiring managers when they saw European Business School of Barcelona and the potential questions.  Did you go to Barcelona to attend? Only in my mind. And yet $249.... it beckons me...#Since we're talking about a business degree here, let's look at what ENEB is doing through that lens, and see if what they're offering is unsustainable, as some have claimed. 1st, I've read through comments and share the skepticism.  I'm on this to thread because I too saw the Groupon deal. I googled it because I'd love the education and was curious to see if this was a scam. If 1M people sign up worldwide for $250, how much revenues has this school brought in? Enough to pay a staff, develop the online courses, and make offering this automated MBA course at a few hundred dollars worth while? Now times that by 10. This tuition model has the potential to bring in billions, on top of the tuitions ENEB brings in conventionally with their campuses. Now Think of how many people worldwide would bite at taking an MBA course for such a low price. Most can afford $200-$300. If they get millions of takers, this becomes an enormous cash cow with low overhead. So from a business model aspect, this seems to pass the test. Think too, only a small percentage of those signing up for $250 ( can't remember the exact amount)  will actually follow through with completing the course. I don't know the drop off factor, but if it's anything like the drop out rate of more expensive real estate courses, (less that 5% go on to do anything with it)  it has to be large. Low tuition= low skin in the game.  So they will only have to service a fraction of those that sign up. It's a brilliant model, if they can get past the too good to be true stigma. That being said, I don't know If I'm going to try it. I'm already too busy as it is. But I am intrigued. For me the business education is the value, not the diploma, as I've worked for myself since I was a teenager. I'll save this thread and will check back on what others are experiencing. And yes, I have a Reddit account, but I haven't used it at all. I mainly signed up to read articles I couldn't read unless I signed up. So go ahead, I know from the comments above, I'll probably be suspected as an undercover troll or something. Cheers.#Hey, just also come across this on groupon and wondering what you ended up going for?So far I'm leaning on just going for it as its so cheap  my logic being even worst case I'll hopefully learn something useful from it, £250 isn't exactly bank breaking...#Wow it’s ridiculously obvious this is a scam degree thing.#I bought it... about six months ago. The platform is outdated however for such a low price it's more than enough. I haven't finished... if I ever do I'll let you know if the diploma they send seems legit or not.#Hey y'all...I saw this Groupon deal and I currently am in Barcelona. I'm planning on going to their office this upcoming week to see if it's legit or if I should ask for a refund. I'll keep y'all updated :)#@roman_s thank you for this thread! Half a year later and still so important!!#Okay, so it's been 2 years, now.  For those of you who've bought/registered on a lark, what was the outcome?

I still can't find if they are accredited by any national / local education boards.I guess the course content might still be useful (for its price) but I am still not convinced, for example, that I can put it this ""degree"" on LinkedIn.#Ok so I guess in this case the link is imperative to know the company which does have a ""decent"" reputation.  https://www.groupon.com/deals/n-eneb-business-school-online-mba-masters-degreeRemoved all ref links. So it legit#Why is everyone from this company posting with brand new accounts and 0 karma. Welcome to Reddit where everything is bullshit till your vetted through karma and profile age.#Thank you for sharing that information, Dr. LeBlanc.  Have you checked more on ENEB?  Which other schools do you recommend that aren't too expensive?#Keep us in the loop :) I am considering purchasing in a few days too.#Did they ask for Undergraduate record or work experience. How is it your admitted into the program when they only take your cash#Also slightly questionable as your account is 9 days has 1 karma point and 2 posts#Have you started the classes? What do you think about the program? Is it worth it?#Every profile in this (sub)thread is a profile created specifically to comment here. Props to the fake diploma purveyors for the dedication.#How is it so far?#Groupon’s legitimacy is irrelevant. Anyone can promote goods or services through Groupon (or LivingSocial, etc.). ENEB has zero accreditation’s and zero credibility. The only thing they do have is an impressive commitment to creating a convincing online presence.#>This is one of those really risky investments but provided they don't lose their partnership with Universidad Isabel I, this degree can be used with limitation.   It is university accredited degree which is essentially an honorary degree or state-approved degree here in the USA.   If you want the degree to be recognized for regional accreditation,  you probably would have to have another foreign university to have it validated as an accredited degree and then one of the credential evaluators will recognize the validated degree from that foreign university as a regional accredited degree.   You can do this through Azteca Universidad and Universidad de Central Nicuraga.#They just called me.. and confirmed eneb.es is the same as eneb.es .. they have responded to all emails. I'm going to take the bait and report back#I'm guessing it's as ""legit"" as a lot of schools. Ever heard of Trump University?#It might be a scam but you can’t apply American capitalist values to other countries.There are no “tests” or “fees” to apply to graduate school in some European countries. I have an undergraduate degree and a Masters, both from renowned universities, and didn’t pay a penny for them.#Also following.... They called twice and keep extending the offer. They told me the reason they offer this special is because their about to get n a semester and have spots open so they want to fill it. At the start of my post I was 25% skeptical. How I am 50/50 .... Have no idea as no where can I find a complaint, reasoning or critism of this MBA program#You don’t need to worry about the deal going away. The fake degree is offered at this “discount” via  several sellers, including LivingSocial. Sometimes they claim tuition is worth $8400 and they offer a price of $299.  [LivingSocial](https://www.livingsocial.com/browse/hampton-roads?lat=36.053&lng=-76.663&query=eneb&address=Near+Me&division=hampton-roads&locale=en_US) So, hey. I guess you do save $50 through the current Groupon special!#Your Reddit account also looks suspecte#Would I take advice on educational opportunities from a guy that can’t even distinguish the difference between *too and to... 🙄 Probably not#It's Jan 13 2020 and the Groupon is still there. When I attempted my masters before I was shocked that my school accepted my friends online degree from a runny dink school#Roman, I've read through your comments and share your skepticism.  Just playing devil's advocate here: I'm on this to thread because I too saw the Groupon deal. If 1M people sign up worldwide for $250, how much revenues has this school brought in? Enough to pay a staff and make offering this automated MBA course at a few hundred dollars worth while? Now times that by 10. This tuition model has the potential to bring this school billions, on top of the tuitions they bring in conventionally with their campuses. Think of how many people worldwide would bite at taking an MBA course for such a low price. Most can afford $200-$300. If they get millions of takers, this becomes a huge cash cow with low overhead.Think too, only a small percentage of those signing up for $250 will follow through with completing the course. I don't know the drop off factor, but if it's like the drop out rate in more expensive real estate courses, (less that 5% go on to do anything with it)  it has to be large. So they will only have to service a fraction of those that sign up.#EU Business School has 13 1-star reviews. But that's a completely different school from ENEB, which isn't listed on pissedconsumer at all.#Groupon is not very well know for vetting. Rather they accept deals if any fraudulent activity is reported they block the seller and go into an investigation. Amazon uses a similar model. From my conclusion, ENEB is a online collection of business courses on an older edu SaaS platform. If you want to follow a more formal process of what an MBA student would experience (outside of actual in person group work, speaking, pitches, etc...) this would be suitable. In my opinion it is not worth it with Pluralsight, Lynda.com, Udemy around where you can gain specific knowledge.The marketing company hired is an aggressive company with some slightly questionable tactics (refer to cheap bought reddit account to dismiss constructive criticism and rudimental insults). Which makes me think the marketing/ad company should take the ENEB course themselves in marketing.#Well I was dumb enough to purchase it. So far it looks legit. I finished 1 out of 11 modules I’m doing digital marketing, it’s not that bad because it’s just multiple choice exams. The hard part are the final projects for each module, which they’re asking 18 pages for each one. I called the University recently and the guy that answered said “of course you do receive  your diploma in master digital marketing” I still doubt this, as everyone has been saying this looks too good to be true. But I want to finish this program in 6 months so I’ll update the results and tell y’all if it’s legit.#Everyone has explained it above. Self-directed course work on an old learning platform. Key component of MBA training seems to be missing such as group case studies etc... Good for learning about business but consensus it won't compete MIT Sloan MBA nor even worth putting on a resume as recruiters would think it's deceitful.#Wow, a single comment from a 1-time user. Welcome to r/scams - free MBAs on your right#Sure, dude. Feel free to include hyperlinks to your bogus references. And welcome to Reddit for the 9th time (the number of profiles created exclusively to convince users of ENEB’s legitimacy).#It does help. @raycathode  on that thread and @spyderninjarider in this discussion posted near-identical messages “on a lark.” The people selling the fake degrees have made an amazing concerted effort  to create social media presence and convince others to buy.#Yes, people don't usually have 1 comment in their history of Reddit to defend a fake University like the other 3 fake account spotted on here. Good for them on making money of naive too good to be true model.  Another scam, another con artist(s), another scam reply from ENEBs social marketing campaign. We look forward to another account (hopefully you guys can buy an aged account for a couple bucks more). And still no reviews from accredited Reddit users.#Wow, have you finished and get the diploma?#Did you make it to the school? I am interested in hearing your opinion...#Happy and currently benefitting from the degree I have received. I studied MBA, and my name and the program I took is verifiable through the website of Universidad Internacional Isabel I de Castilla (Universidad Isabel I). I am currently a Professor in my country.#I've heard nothing but good things about ENEB's programs from [degreeinfo.com](https://degreeinfo.com) and [degreeforum.net](https://degreeforum.net).   These programs are recognized by several NACES evaluators although the results vary from one evaluator to another.   It has served its purpose for many graduates.Many people are skeptical that haven't taken it but a majority of those who have say it was worth it for the price and recognition.#Scam is going to always be a scam.#They are not accredited by the US Dept of Education.  However, they do have some recognition through the Spanish government as an ""own or propio"" degree.  This means that they are accredited or certified by a university (Universidad Isabel I)  which allows for the degree to be awarded as a legal credential and used for career advancement.  However, you are limited to only using these credentials for the private sector and not higher education or public sector jobs.  These degrees are not designed for entry into a doctorate but rather for professional development.Several foreign credential evaluators have variable approaches to propio credentials.  If they are recognized as university accredited and not by the government, some will give the equivalency of the Master Propio as graduate credit and/or graduate certificate, an additional accredited Bachelors degree, or a non-accredited Masters degree.   These credentials have led to job offers but usually will not be treated as equal to the USA's regionally accredited Masters equivalent although it is up to schools and employers to determine how they will ultimately view the unofficial credential granted by a university.  Some might equate it as an accredited Masters degree as a standalone or based on previous coursework.#ENEB is legit. The people you are dealing with are not associated with ENEB at all.Also, trusting groupon as your source to check if something is legit will not end well.Even the price is a dead giveaway. We use euros (€) in Spain. Not dollars.#Hi Roman, Did you subscribe? I hesitate to subscribe, but I wonder if we have fees after (books, coming to spain for tests...??).. And I have the same qustions than you about the scam or not... What did you do eventually?#@Roman_s, I've been using reddit for years. Never had the need for a profile or account. Only created one today so I could read more of the comments regarding eneb. I have no affiliation with the school, simply looking for feedback. Chances are I'll never be fully vetted here but you may see a comment from time to time.#If you message the School itself using their email they offer you the price of groupon. AND groupon just had an extra $25 of savings so mention that if you email them!#Did you end up purchasing? I'm going back and forth...sounds sketchy but for only $250 I'd be down to have an MBA#I mean... I don’t actually know if it’s a LEGIT masters. Quizzes never count just the final exam on each section. I only got it cause I want to teach English online and you have to have a degree.#ENEB on it's on is not accredited but you earn accredited degrees based on their partnership with Universidad Isabel I.   However,   those degrees are university accredited degrees which here in the USA would likely be considered either a honorary degree or a legal degree from a state approved school.   Some may accept this type of degree while many others will not.   The degrees from this school will likely be seen as an extensive MOOC program rather than an academic degree.#I saw this too. So anymore details? What happened after you purchased it?#You just lost your credibility by injecting liberal politics into a serious post.#From what university and how did you get it for free?#3 posts every 2 years .. aged 6 years.#1 karma , 0 days account.

They even have their logo in the entrance.#Hey, I didn't have the time to go like I said I would and then the quarantine craziness came about. I will try to call and see if they are still open. If not then it will have to wait until after the quarantine#It’s not a scam.  People have gotten their degrees from ENEB evaluated from different foreign evaluators as graduate credit,  an accredited advanced or 2nd Bachelors Degree or an unaccredited Masters Degree.   You get what you pay for as these degrees are not fully recognized by USA standards but they are still legitimate and in many cases useful for your resume and  professional purposes.   Some schools will accept ENEB for entrance into a doctorate here in the USA.#How fo you know they ate not affiliated with the real ENEB?

Any help, any insight would be useful to me. I have done my bachelor's in commerce, and have some experience related to it.";Finding a job shouldn't be an issue if you're willing to work for minimum wage in the service industry.  But you need to be aware that housing here in Barrie is super expensive.  A modest room is going to cost you upwards of $500/month anything that resembles an apartment or private space will be much higher.#I came to Barrie for school and loved it! I can’t speak to your program, but Georgian keep a lot of stats on graduation & employment rates for each program available to prospective students - this was helpful when I was making the decision on school and program Rent in Barrie is very expensive - check out places4students.com and kijiji.ca for availability and price. You’ll likely be able to work 20 hours per week while you’re in school- if you’re willing to work fast food or retail, you’ll have no problem finding part time work.#Min wage = $14 / hr#>Is it difficult to find part time jobs to support myself during my stay there?You should be aware that you need the funds upfront to show you can support yourself on a student visa. They will ask to see savings of tuition costs + $10,000 Canadian (each year). Finding a part time job isn't a problem if you're willing to work for minimum wage. Just be aware Barrie has terrible transit which might limit your options. You are also limited to working a **maximum** 20 hours a week during your school semester (you can do 40 hours when school is out during the summer).#I took computer programming at Georgian and did not have a great experience. A lot of the computer related teachers that I had (2 years ago) were part time, new to teaching and sometomes had never touched the subject. (my advanced Sql class was taught by a chemist - I really wish I was making that up). I love Barrie as a city and want to return badly. If you intend on staying in Canada after school, you'll likely be working in Toronto, which means you'll likely move. I would look into Sheridan as an alternative, they have several campuses closer to the city and honestly with how expensive Barrie is now it wouldn't be much different price wise#What is the minimum wage? Every place on google, or anyone I ask has a different answer to that! And yeah! Rooms looks costlier than Toronto there! And the residences allow max 2 people in a room.#And what kind of jobs can I expect?#I definitely can work retail/ cash counters or such. I'll refer to those websites for details, thank you very much!#Thank you for this, definitely would look for alternatives.#Minimum wage is $14/hour in Ontario.  Unless you are a server in a restaurant where you can earn tips, then it is $12.20/hour.There are some private rooming houses run by greedy, unscrupulous landlords that allow 4 people per room, but I really can't fathom anyone wanting to live like that.#Pretty much every single Tim Horton's, McDonalds and every other fast food joint in the city has a help wanted sign.  Other than that there's usually jobs available in the hotels for cleaning and night staff, and gas station and fitness club cashiers.

I am now a data analyst for a Fortune 500 company. Aside from creating MS Power BI dashboards, I also do a lot of PHP scripting, database design, and I do full stack web development too.I'm only making 62k/year at my current job. This is nowhere near what I want to be making, and the job is just sort of unfulfilling in general. I feel like I'm not using a lot of the skills I have as a person with a degree in computer science... Like basically anyone off the streets could take a month to learn SQL and accomplish most of what I do.I figure I'd be more satisfied if I got a position as a data scientist or something similar. I've always been fascinated by machine learning, AI, neural networks etc. And big data seems to be where the money is at in computer science right now too, so I figure it might be the route to take (at least for now).So now that I've got my bachelor's degree in computer science, I'm currently going to school for a master's degree in data science with a concentration in computational intelligence. I figure even if data science doesn't last, my bachelor's in computer science will still be enough to move into other things if I want to. And I'll be graduating with my Master's in December 2020, or earlier if I decide to take more classes faster. So it'll take a year and a half or less for that.Does this sound like a smart route to take in today's world of computer science? I certainly didn't get a degree in CS to make only 62k/year like I do now (especially since I already have over 100k in student debt), and I need something more complex and fulfilling. And money obviously isn't everything, but I like money and likely won't be satisfied until I'm making at least double what I'm making now. Life ain't cheap these days, and neither are my hobbies. Lol. And lots of things interest me in CS, so I might as well just go where the money is.;"I just want to say that making ""only"" 62k is nothing to be ashamed about.  Like that's quite a bit above median income and really good if you only recently finished your undergrad.  Granted with CS you could be a SWE and make 70-80+ out of school, I think you may have unreasonable expectations if you think you should already be making what you're aiming for. That being said, if you're just noting that this is where you eventually want to end up, your strategy is solid and I see no scenario where you don't achieve what you want to if you stay on this path.  Good luck!#I think it depends on the program. If you have a good CS background, then I might suggest focusing more on data engineering, since your learning curve there will be less steep than it would be for someone who is coming in without deep CS experience. Data engineers don't really need to know much about data science, per se, but it's a nice to have.#[deleted]#I'd say you ought to address where you want to end up before researching schools. Data science programs are every bit as broad (and expensive) as the disciplines it encompasses. Some programs focus on things you may not even care about. First, go talk to data scientists, analysts, business intelligence analysts, etc about that they do. Depending on what you like and how much programming is involved, you may be better with a CS masters. You will have to assess where you feel you're lacking and improve that within the degree. Data engineers also benefit from a CS degree.If you find you like predictive analytics more, then DS may fit you better. I also met plenty of data scientists recently who only work on visualizations. It's all different day to day work, and I'd figure out where you might like to land before signing on to pay 20-60k in tuition.#Sounds awesome. As someone in a position who hires data scientists, I love CS folks - since I don’t have a CS background (epidemiology and biostatistics) they always bring unique ways to innovate. Good luck!#I suppose 62k isn't terrible, but I do already have a (bachelor's) degree in CS and have had a lot of people tell me I'm definitely underpaid currently. I've been working for this company for almost 2 years, starting as a web dev co-op and then switching to my data analyst co-op position, then going officially full time as a data analyst. They're still paying me the same as what they pay their data analysts who know nothing other than SQL and power BI, which I think is unfair because most of what I'm doing at this point is something none of them have the skillset to accomplish. While I am still a ""data analyst"" by job description, I play the role of a full stack web developer most of the time and the roles of data analysts/other things other times.The only issue I can see is if I decide to switch out of the data science route and back into some other form of SWE. I really enjoy programming, so wherever I end up I'd like to be doing a lot of that for sure. But I don't think that'll be problem since I already have my BS in CS, and a master's usually isn't that necessary for that. Thank you for the insight!#My logic was that I already have a bachelor's degree in CS, which I am under the impression should be adequate to get me into whatever field I might want to switch into in CS.I figured the DS master's degree would get me into the field of DS faster, giving me a stronger skillset than most who are somewhat new to the field.I figured after a while, the degree title doesn't matter much anymore, because what you learn in college really doesn't matter much once you have a good amount of experience in the field. I don't think the classes I took in college will make much of a difference in 5, 10 or 20 years if I've been gaining real experience in the field.However, I have been considering switching to a CS master's just for that reason of it being more versatile. I suppose I'll need to put a bit more thought into it. Who knows, maybe I'll even double major and get a master's in both if that's possible.#I'm already in school taking classes for data science. Thankfully this program covers a lot of things I'm interested in learning. However I'm beginning to think maybe a CS master's might be the safer route, I might either switch to that or just double-major in both CS and DS if it wouldn't require too much more time and money.#Awesome, thank you!#I didn't realize that you were actually utilizing all of the skills you have for your position to help your company (I was under the impression you had a lot of skills, but didn't actually use them in your role).  In that case it definitely sounds like you should be getting more.  I honestly don't know enough about different masters' to know the best route, but it sounds like maybe a master's in CS could be a good option if you still have time to change?  You could probably get both DS and high level CS positions with one of those.  Either way I don't think you'll be in a position where a DS master's will hurt you, but there is potentially something that could help more based on the contingency that DS falls out of favor for you or in general  these different scenarios' outcomes range from good to great so it's hard to make a 'bad' decision here.#Depending on where you end up, you may need more of one than the other. There really isn't a one size fits all data science program out there for anyone. If you have any questions about Northwestern's programs, feel free to PM me. I'm almost half way done with their data science graduate program.#I think I have 2 days left to add/drop classes. If I want to switch to CS, I should probably figure it out before then if I can. I think I might go over my options and possibly either switch to CS or maybe even double-major in CS and DS if it wouldn't be that much more work. We'll see."
bigdata;dc7nqz;1570007256.0;/r/bigdata/comments/dc7nqz/can_there_ever_be_too_much_data_in_big_data/;Can there ever be too much data in big data?;;No. A better statement: if you have decent cheap storage and any inclination of hidden value then no. Most organizations only use half the data in their data warehouses AT ALL. Most use only a few percent of their unstructured data sources for anything - and whilst there may be a lot of garbage, most orgs fail on many levels to even scratch the surface of what they should know about their clients. Data size is generally not the issue, its more on the people - who fail at every turn to move past ideas of running the same SQL query they've run for a decade.#Yes.  In that case, you start processing that data on the edge before sending a subset/aggregated set to your data 'sink'.

I can sort of see the point of big pharma saying they're just filling orders placed by pharmacists and if those pharmacists are dirty and sending the drugs out the back door to organized crime, that's on the pharmacists.  But then they mentioned the final example of a pharmacy increasing their total annual purchase of oxycodone by ~750% over the previous year and the pharmaceutical company not saying shit about it.I think the real tragedy here is that it's a problem born out of greed that will be solved by handing over a portion of the proceeds in the form of fines and settlements and life will go on until the next time the system breaks down.  I feel like the top level decision makers should maybe face charges of criminal negligence causing death for choosing not to take action when it was obvious that there were enormous leaks in the supply chain."
startups;d6fcyl;1568905647.0;/r/startups/comments/d6fcyl/analytics_without_numbers_viewing_products/;Analytics without numbers: Viewing products through users’ eyes; Here are two things you’ll hear a lot from product teams:1. A lot of data is needed to reduce uncertainty and get an accurate picture of users’ needs and behavior.2. People working on products understand and know their users well.The above statements are misconceptions, and in both cases, the reverse is true. In this post, I will discuss how analyzing user behavior without big data (debunking the first premise) will help us avoid the unpleasant outcomes of thinking you already know your users (debunking the second premise).## First misconception: We need a lot of data to reduce total uncertaintyImagine an infinite sized pool of black and white balls. Your task is to find out the share of white balls. Initially, you are in a state of complete uncertainty. How much data do you need to find the answer to this question?If you take 100 random balls and calculate the proportion of white balls, then you will know the answer with an accuracy of ± 9.8%. If you add another 100 balls, you will increase the accuracy of your answer to ± 6.9%  Add 200 more balls—you are up to ± 4.9%. Another 600 balls—up to ± 3.1%. With 9,000 more balls, you will achieve ± 1% accuracy.Did you notice that the first 100 balls gave us a lot more knowledge than the next 100, and going from 100 to 200 balls had much more impact on the accuracy than the 1,000-10,000 range?Let’s keep this in mind and move on to the second misconception.## Second misconception: People working on products understand and know their users wellThe second misconception assumes we understand the products we are working on.The truth is, we don’t.We are always looking for ways to close the gap between the product model we envision and the actual product we build. To do so, we try out new tools and approaches, communicate with users, conduct experiments and analyze data.The goal behind all of these activities is simple. We want to improve our understanding of the product and users, to find opportunities for growth and development, and to increase the proportion of the right decisions we make.## Viewing the product through users’ eyesWhat was this long introduction about? I want to introduce you to a method that will allow you to learn a lot about your product. It is very simple:*Take a few users and observe how they use your product.*No, you don’t have to conduct an interview with these users. There’s also no need to calculate the metrics that characterize their behavior in the product. We literally need to take a specific user and monitor how she interacts with the product throughout her entire period of usage.How can you do it? If you already have event logging set right in the product, it is very simple:1. Select the group of users you want to study (you will need different users to get answers to different questions).2. For each user of this group, create a sequence of all the events they generate, including the event parameters, from the time they start using the product.3. You will end up with a sequence of events for each user in your product. You can divide this sequence into separate sessions for convenience.You can also do it with the help of Amplitude’s User Look-Up tool.Now you have everything you need to view the product through the user’s eyes. Look at the sequence of events and start analyzing it. Take notes along the way.You will observe what the user does while going through the onboarding and afterward, what difficulties she encounters along the way, at what point her first session ends, whether she has experienced the product’s value by that time, when does she retain and how long it takes her to do so, and much more.Now, let’s go back to the first misconception. Studying a small number of users (50-100) with this method will help you find out the following:1. How and why do people use your product?2. What problems do they face at different stages in your product?3. How does the actual usage differ from what you designed the product for4. Which users tend to stay and which tend to leave? What are the differences between them?Another benefit of doing this type of analysis is that it helps you come up with a bunch of hypotheses that you can test/validate through data analysis, experiments or user research.## Case studies of analyzing user behavior through session analysisThe method we described above solves a wide range of tasks, so it can be considered quite universal. Here are a few cases where session analysis proved to be very useful.## Yandex Maps RedesignRedesigning any old popular service is extremely risky. It’s very important not to break any of the existing use cases in the new design.A few years ago, I worked on the redesign of the web version of [Yandex Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.yandex.yandexmaps&hl=en), the most popular online map service in Russia and CIS market with over 30 million users. Due to the complexity and scale of the task, we wanted to make sure we understood thoroughly all the use cases our users have. To do that we decided to manually analyze user sessions.We selected a few hundred random users, manually examined their sessions, categorized them, and wrote down our observations. The result was a table of existing product use cases and their popularity.You might argue that this approach was not necessary, that we could have just calculated the share of people who used the product to build routes, those who checked the traffic jams, or searched for organizations, etc. But these quantitative indicators would have hidden a lot of useful and critical information about the way people solve their problems with the product.It turned out, for example, that different people used the same features and solved similar tasks in completely different ways. And it was something we should have considered in the new version of the product.In the process, we made a number of unexpected discoveries. For example, it seemed obvious to us that in the task “to find an organization on a map -> find out how to get there,” users build a route directly from the organization’s snippet (see the orange arrow in the screenshot).In reality, however, it turned out that only a small percent of users did this. Most users simply copied the address of the organization and pasted it in the routes tab to build a new route (see the green arrow on the screenshot).I don’t know any other way to learn about such unexpected twists in users’ behavior other than tracking their events and examining their sessions. And the fact that such behavior exists entails many questions. Creating routes directly from the organization’s snippet is clearly easier than copy-pasting its address in the route tab. Why are users missing it? Is the organization’s featured snippet overloaded with data? Are users not noticing the button?## Finding problems in the first versions of [King of Thieves](https://www.kingofthieves.com/)When creating products, we usually assume people are going to use them in the “correct” way. We design a product in a way that helps users discover its core value as soon as possible.Surprisingly, “silly” users always do everything in their own way instead of the way we anticipate. This is exactly what happened with the first versions of King of Thieves.King of Thieves is a mobile game in which you have to break into dungeons and steal treasures and gems. You can play the game in single-player mode, but the true value of the game is in its competitive multiplayer mode. The key feature of the game is to steal gems from other players to become the wealthiest thief. At the same time, players must defend their own treasures and build traps in order to stop rivals from stealing their treasures.King of Thieves turned out to be a very successful game—but the launch of its first version was a disaster.The game’s retention was a poor 26%. Most players left the game shortly after they tried it and never came back.To understand the reasons behind this, we looked at the user sessions in the way described above. We wanted to understand what was wrong.The core value of the game was in its multiplayer mode. When creating the game’s onboarding, we assumed that we would show how the game mechanics work in the first levels of the single-player campaign, and then players would switch to the multiplayer mode when they were ready. That’s exactly why we made a huge red multiplayer button after all!But it turned out that most users simply went through the single-player levels without ever paying attention to the multiplayer game mode. After some time, they got stuck in a difficult level, or just got bored, and abandoned the game.There were few who switched to multiplayer, but in most cases the players saw no difference from the single-player mode. The opponent either had no gems to steal, or he did, but when players completed the level, they weren’t awarded the gem, even though stealing gems from other players was part of the game’s core loop.After analyzing the sessions of several hundred users (the sessions were very short, so it didn’t take us too long), we figured out that less than 10% of users had a chance to experience the essence of the game in their first few sessions. Those who grasped it were much more likely to keep playing the game.Of course, we should not forget that at that point, this was just a correlation—it did not necessarily mean that players kept playing the game because of that experience. Nonetheless, it was a good starting point, and the hypothesis that walking more users through this experience will improve the metrics was worth testing.We could have probably found this problem through metrics alone: We would see that a very small percentage of new users try the multiplayer mode. And in most cases, those who do try do not steal gems from their opponents. But we didn’t know exactly what we were looking for or when we needed to pay our attention. Perhaps everything was fine, and players simply didn’t find the mechanics of the game entertaining enough.We launched a new version of the game in which we walked players through the multiplayer mode in the onboarding and also made sure that when players attack a dungeon, there’s a gem for them to retrieve and they actually get it after completing the level. As a result, the game metrics significantly improved: Day 1 retention soared from 26% to 41%, while Day 7 retention increased from 9% to a healthier 20%.While examining the sessions and looking at the product through the eyes of our users, we found the stark contradiction between what players experienced and what we wanted them to actually experience.## Optimizing the Funnel of adding a flight in [App in the Air](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/app-in-air-best-flight-tracker/id527299553)Here is a wonderful example that Bayram Annakov shared in his [blog](https://medium.com/@bayramannakov/funnel-analysis-investigating-why-users-drop-6cccbbe41968#.d6c2vl77l).App in the Air is a mobile app that keeps track of your itineraries, boarding passes, and frequent-flier programs. The application helps ease the frustration and complexities of finding and managing flights.However, the product team found that 30% of users of the App in the Air didn’t add a flight after opening the app screen where they were expected to do that.The problem turned out to be pretty trivial, as has been the case in many similar problems. The users would search for the name of the airline or airport they sought in their native language—the search worked only in English.The funnel demonstrated that 30% of users churn at a certain step, but in order to find out why, it was necessary to go one level deeper and look at what exactly people were doing at that step.After making sure all the app’s localized languages were considered, the churn rate at this funnel step declined from 30% to 5%.## Personal sales firstY Combinator co-founder Paul Graham has an iconic essay titled “[Do things that don’t scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html).” One of the things Graham mentions is that founders should personally find their first customers and help them onboard into their product, serving as a tutorial manual in a way.Why? Because it gives the opportunity to look at your product through users’ eyes, which in turn allows you to quickly find points your users don’t understand, where they find the maximum value, and what is and isn’t important to them.It is true that this can be labor intensive and not fun at all. It is way easier and less stressful to look at a drop in the funnel at a specific step than to seek and observe lack of understanding in real people to whom you’ve recently spoken about all the advantages of your service.Personal sales work great for B2B products. In fact, session analysis is a variation of this approach that is more suitable for B2C products (though it can also work for B2B). Now you can select the users you need and study them in detail, like in the previous example with App in the Air, where users reached the screen where they could add a flight, but for some reason didn’t complete the step.Moreover, you can also contact these users personally later and ask them the questions you have in mind. This will make the overall picture as complete as possible.## Pros and cons of analyzing user sessions manuallyAnalyzing user sessions will give you a more decent understanding of how people are using your product. This is not an abstract knowledge of how various popular features and conversion of various funnel steps work, but a vivid idea about your users’ paths within the product from the moment they start using it until they either churn or your service becomes a part of their life.Another bonus of such an analysis is making it easier for you to work on new things in the product. Having a clear picture of the current paths of your users inside the service, you can better predict how and at what stage the planned changes will affect them. This increases your chances of making the right decision.Unlike using metrics, this method loses much less information along the way. But, as is usually the case, it also has its disadvantages. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to compare different versions of the product based on the manual session analysis method. You will have to analyze too many of them to obtain statistically significant results. In this case, metrics, cohort analysis, and A/B tests will help you.## Summing it upMany think that analytics is all about numbers and mathematics. In my opinion, analytics should help you to understand your product and answer questions you have about it. Numbers and metrics can help with this and solve some problems rather well, but you should not limit yourself to them. For some tasks, other approaches, including manual session analysis, will do a much better job.Try examining the session of 50 users of your product. If you don’t find anything interesting, you’ve only lost a few hours of your time. However, and I can bet on it, you will probably find a few pleasant surprises.;Great! I'm starting to develop an app and will surely consider all this things during the launch of my MVP. Thanks!#Fantastic write up man! I found the King of Thieves section particularly interesting  expecting the user to shift to multiplayer and realizing they were (as much as they knew) content having not ever hit the meat of the application in the development team’s eyes. The obvious isn’t always so obvious, hahaha#You are really welcome! :) If you develop your app, you might find this one useful:  [https://gopractice.io/](https://gopractice.io/)#Thanks a lot!

Foster would go for you, but I would suggest being able to frame your story a bit better, maybe retake the GMAT for R2 and try to spin your work experience as a bit more people-oriented. B-schools kind of look at back-office IT/ Software guys as purely technical and not able to communicate (I mean your GMAT verbal kind of drives the nail in the coffin on this assumption as well).Also your reason for MBA is not a very compelling one -- especially because technical consulting does not require pretty much anything that the MBA has to offer. Additionally, unless it is a huge expert-level IT cert, the adcom is probably not going to understand what it is or what the implications are.I would say areas to focus on :1. GMAT1a.

elasticsearch;dcqp4x;1570108301.0;/r/elasticsearch/comments/dcqp4x/how_to_index_a_billion_records_from_multiple/;How to index a billion records from multiple sources in Elastic Search?;"Hi, I'm new here and would like to ask a question. I'm not an expert in ES and big data, but our team is starting to explore a new area before we start hiring some experts in this area. My question is about what is the right way to build an ES architecture such that we can index a billion records from multiple sources.**Background**: We have acquired about 1 billion+ records of people data, coming from multiple sources.   Each source has a slightly different ""shape"" to the data, with a large percentage of overlap (duplicates), and slightly conflicting values between fields. We have set up a pipeline using Apache Beam to transform this data and send it to an Elastic Search index so that we can search this data, but we are not sure of our approach. We are trying to achieve: 1) Paginated full text search queries on certain fields, 2) Deduplicate records (there's currently a lot of overlap within those 1b records, 3) Be able to perform regular refreshes and enrichment of the data and reindex without interrupting search performance. Our sources provide a whole new version of the previous data (rather than a changefile), about once a quarter. We'll probably enrich our data on a daily basis for a few thousand records at a time in addition to those big refreshes. What I'm wondering right now is:1. Is ElasticSearch even the right tool for the job? 2. If so, does it make sense to combine all of these ""rows"" of data from different sources into a single index (after cleaning and de-duping)?&#x200B Thanks for pointing me in the right direction! Any small advice or tips appreciated";* ES should be a fine tool for the job, although depending on how big the records are you may need a decent sized cluster for 1BN. I think ES vs some other db depends mostly on your search needs, if it's heavy in advanced fulltext ES is probably right, if your searches are mostly relational you might look at postgres or mysql. Also note that ES tends to eat ram, (you'll likely want a cluster of 64gig boxes), but for good text search performance that's mostly true of any db.* ES supports updating existing rows just fine without messing with performance (again dependent on cluster resources), including 'upserts' that only modify certain fields, which makes it easy to add/edit some fields in a record and not others. Inserts are about as fast as any other normal relational db (so mostly dependent on resources and tuning rather than some tech limit), and can be done in bulk. Without knowing more about your data I can't say anything intelligent about whether you should have separate indexes or not, it probably depends mostly on your cleaning. Keep in mind you can always add in the source as an additional field so you can search by source.#1. Yes. Elasticsearch is great at both storing a huge amount of data and searching through it with full-text search. You might need bigger boxes than you might think depending on traffic, but it's very scale-able and resilient.2. If you're going to be replacing the entire index every so often then it probably makes more sense to have a different index for each provider split into time series. So have something along the lines of `customer-provider-2019.01.01` then when you dump the new data use `customer-provider-2019.03.05` and drop the old index. That's going to be a lot faster than trying to update each record.#On the de-duplication matter, Logstash and it's fingerprint input plugin is your friend.Logstash can read a record from an input source (like an existing ES index or other source) and (using the fingerprint input plugin) generate a record \_id based on a calculated hash of chosen fields, and then output that record to an ES index. If the ES index already contains a record that has the \_id, it will overwrite the existing record and thus eliminate the (existing) duplicate.This is nice for two reasons- one, it allows you to take all your varying input sources of records (*read: not necessarily ES indexes (though they can be used as well)*) and (*via the grok and mutate input plugins*) come up with a single format of fields that will be used for your records on the ES cluster, conceivably on a single index. Second, it allows you to ensure that no duplicates are written to your ES cluster from the get-go (*i.e. you don't have to go through one step of ES index ingestion of all sources and then an additional step of performing record de-duplication.*)#Elasticsearch is probably what you want for the search part. Frequent updates can bloat the indices somewhat so you'd want to regularly call force merge or index into a new index and discard the old index when done. You can use aliases to avoid disrupting read traffic. You may also want to use specialized query, data, and master nodes to further minimize impact of that. If that is still a concern, you could use a separate cluster for indexing and deploy snapshots to your query cluster or use replication.The rest is really your data pipeline. If you can use some clever id scheme for deduplicating that would be helpful. Whether that makes sense for your data, depends on the data. If you can come up with some shared schema than yes, if that is hard, maybe work with separate indices for your different data sources. Using Kafka with queue compaction might work for you.

I've already graduated (May 19), but I didn't have an actuarial internship.I do, however, have 2 data analyst internships (one in experimental design/analysis, the other in big data analysis) with departments at my university.To what extent would an employer care about these compared to an actuarial internship? Should I try to pursue an actuarial-specific internship?;I'd say apply for actuarial internships and actuarial full time. It really depends on the company and how well you can articulate the roles and how it's related to actuarial work. Honestly, if you've had a data related internship, it's close enough to an actuarial internship (IMO).#Internships aren't a pre-requisite to full time entry level jobs.  They just make you more competitive.  It really just would decrease how many applications you might have to send out to get successful interviews scheduled, and might narrow your options to the less exciting positions, but it's no big deal, actuaries start in one job wherever they get it and in a year or two move to one they're more excited about, only to eventually realize that all jobs are equally undesirable.#Thank you, I'll work on explaining it and keep that in mind.#Interesting  thank you for this advice, I'll keep it in mind.and well, I guess thats what the work force is like haha

Data analytics or data science vs web development (Javascript, ruby, react, css, html)Granted I know that sales is important, but in terms of tech skills, what would be a better skill to have in today's day? I'm asking because I know that big data is the future, so should I ditch traditional programming in favor of learning data science?Thanks;This is a strange way of looking at it imo.  Tech entrepreneurship is a very broad term- can't exactly recommend a path if you dont provide information about what you want to do entrepreneurially.  Further, data analytics, data science, and programming are all intertwined.  You can't do anything with data unless you have some programming abilities to manipulate it.  For the programming languages listed it sounds like youre asking if it'd be better to pursue data or web development, and that comes down to personal preference imo.  You can make a good living in the startup world or otherwise in either.#[deleted]#You should learn programming and web development over data science. IMO these 2 are far far more in demand and practical skills than data science. I know you are talking about entrepreneurship, but if job numbers are anything to go by, take a look at the number of jobs looking for web dev/programming skills (especially JavaScript!!) vs job numbers for data science. I'd hazard a guess that its 50:1.It seems that data science and AI is the hot new thing but the number of jobs/demand/salary points to web dev and programming by a very large margin.Learn a couple good languages like Python and JavaScript. You'll be able to build things with Those including startup ideas. Can you build a web app if you just know data science? Nope!Move into data science later if you feel like it. Worst case scenario, if your startup ideas don't pan out, you'll have some very in demand skills and you can get a job in web development or simialr without a degree. Note that, lots of jobs in data science still require a formal degree.Now I'm not saying data science is not useful (big data is becoming more of a thing) BUT its just way less useful overall than knowing programming at this point in time.#As others have pointed out, you are looking through wrong lens at entrepreneurship. However, to answer your question, unless you are planning to have your startup to be focusing on Data Analytics, you are better off with other skills that will help you **put a product in front of the** **customer**. Data Analytics will come later once you have a meaningful base of customers.Hope this helps.#Like said above, web development is a much more practical skill to acquire. In 6 months you can bacome a decent one.Data Science, like any other science, requires you to go through the full academic process, which take many years.I was in a similar boat to you in January. I tried both solutions for 4 months each, and that’s the impression i have.#The last part yeah. I just don't if I'd be better off with web development if data is the hot new thing now?#Hmm okay true. Do you think in today's day, data science would hold more value over web dev?#Internet's not going away any time soon, and neither is data.  You can make good money in either.  Try both out to see what you like.  Try building your own website.   Try visualizing some data.#Yup I'm currently learning web development. However, if suppose I want to be an entrepreneur in the future and want to innovate....which of the two would give me an edge? I like web development..but I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on not learning data science with all this ML/AI hype.

I have access to at least a semester's worth of courses from outside the department (I just have to get them approved first). * What are some courses that would be very helpful in getting a job after graduation? * What are some courses you wish you took?I have a list of courses that I have my eye on including:* GIS* Machine Learning* Data Visualization* Data Mining* Neural Networks* Big Data Technologies* Artificial IntelligenceI know this is highly dependent on what I plan to do afterwards, however one of the issues I ran into after undergrad is that I had a lot of potential to learn new skills/tools on the job, but didn't have the skill sets when applying.;A good course in linear models and GLM’s is essential. Even if you’re doing complicated stuff, 90% of it will be a variant of a linear model.#I’d focus on core CS classes like data structures, algorithms, and databases. Machine learning is nice to know, too, but you can self-study that easily if you have a solid stats and CS background.#Data visualization and GIS. Any job will have you presenting info and spatial info is pretty much everything these days.#Those are already required for my degree, thanks!#I've been wondering about that. Data structures and algorithms seems to be one requirement needed to take any higher level CS course.I won't lie, I'm pretty lazy when it comes to self-studying things haha#I know, those two are definitely staying haha#I would recommend against ML and DM while in a stats program. Take them after so you have a solid foundation.

Show that you care about growing in your work by learning the tools that add value to your workIf you really like C, then you should make C projects in your own time#It's hard for anyone to say if you are capable of learning two languages and a bunch of systems at once. Some people are, others not, you are the only one capable of making that decision.One thing to note though, C and Python have very different use cases. If you want to write something more complicated, doing it in C means you need extreme discipline and control, or else risk your code becoming completely unmaintainable. This is much less the case in Python.Generally I'd say that there are few circumstances where there is more than one valid option in the choice between C and Python. Maybe if it was C++.#If you're looking to start in the industry, i would keep in mind that C is usually used for hardware programming since it's such a low level language. You **will** need to learn something else. Java is a gold start since you're familiar with C and you'll need to know at least one procedural language ( which Python is) so you should definitely learn it.#> Generally I'd say that there are few circumstances where there is more than one valid option in the choice between C and Python. Maybe if it was C++.You mean C and C++ in parallel?#No, as in, if you were faced with a project and needed to make a decision as to what language to use, and it stood between C and Python. Very rarely would there be more than one valid option between the two. C++ may be more viable for a project that favors Python than C.

So I'm looking for a switch, I'm around 30 years old, so I hope that's also not too old. Better late than never right?The country where I'm living in now (the Netherlands), has quite a few of opportunities when it comes to switching to consultancy, like doing trainseeships (McKinsey and BCG, but also a lot of secondment agencies). I would like to dip my toes into the business analyst aspects, and focus on how to handle (and apply) big data and machine learning. Hopefully future-proofing myself if I ever decide to switch careers again.I was wondering if there are similar programs/traineeships being offered in the UK, Canada or Australia for people with my background (Biomed MSc or PhD)? These countries specifically cause my foreign girlfriend (non-dutch) wants to a PhD in one of those countries.Tl dr Basically could anyone tell me how the market is for someone with a PhD in biomedical sciences and looking to switch to business analytics? I'm willing to receive a low salary in the first years, as long as I get proper/certified training. Thank you for your time and reading.;

bigdata;d4ueve;1568600536.0;/r/bigdata/comments/d4ueve/just_catching_up_with_this_topic_so_whats_up_with/;Just catching up with this topic. So what's up with big data?;"I didn't know anything about big data until less than a week ago. When I spent a bit of time checking how far big data use cases currently are, I was actually shocked. I realized it's still very early and thus spent a lot of time getting myself involved and reading up. So far I started reading two scientific books on the topic dated 2014 and 2015. The authors give a very exciting vision of all future applications making use of all the sensor data generated by the emerging IoT as well as social media and go on explaining different architectures such as Apache Hadoop, Google Pregel, Google BigTables, Piccolo and more.Then I look back at where we are. And there doesn't seem to be much going on.  According to Google Trends these books where written at a time when there was a certain buzz around the topic ([https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=big%20data](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=big%20data)) that has since slowly faded. Since then we have been moving from the ""inflated expectations"" part of the hype bubble towards the ""trough of disillusionment"".So where are we? Have there been any game-changing innovations since then? Are there big data use cases emerging? From what I can see, Facebook has started looking into a dating app based on personal interests. But they don't seem fully committed to transition to a data-centric business model as they also put a lot of efforts into their Libra project to jump onto the crypto hype train. IBM's big data website suggests a lack of innovation and specific use cases. Yet there has been so much theory available for half a decade now. It looks a bit disappointing all in all but maybe I'm missed anything?Also, any recommendations on promising ideas/trends that are emerging in this field? I'm trying to get involved as I see a huge demand in the coming years.";"Big data suffers from having a very poor definition and operationalization. It turns out that simply *having* data isn't particularly useful, and most of the value comes from the analysis of said data, which is not a process captured by big data's definition. So, big data has given way to fields that explore the ways in which this data can be utilized, such as machine learning and predictive analytics. These analysis methods rely on the existence of big data, but because everything collects data these days, the notion of ""big data"" being a thing isn't nearly as important as it was a few years ago, and much of the buzzwordiness of big data has died down.#Nothing. Big data was all about how you handle really big datasets, splitting them across machines to get enough ram and processing speed. Things have changed - big data aren't so big, because ram is really big, due, in part to AWS (and similar offerings). If you've got a huge dataset, you just spin up a massive AWS/GCP/Azure instance and then use your regular tools, which it's possible to parallelize. I tend to use R. so I'd just use mclapply() if I had to. I imagine there's something similar in python. A server with 160 CPUs and 4 TB of ram can be had from GCP for a few dollars per hour ([https://medium.com/@robaboukhalil/a-tale-of-two-clouds-amazon-vs-google-4f2520516a38](https://medium.com/@robaboukhalil/a-tale-of-two-clouds-amazon-vs-google-4f2520516a38) ) and Amazon and Azure offer something similar.At work I use SQL a lot. It doesn't care how big my dataset is, it just crunches it, sharding it appropriately across many CPUs (and machines for ram? I don't even know - it's invisible to me.)Thanks to technology improvements, we don't need to care if our data are big or not, it's all just data.#>It turns out that simply having data isn't particularly useful, and most of the value comes from the analysis of said data,Exactly. To add on this, there are a few buzzy words like ""data lakes"" and data warehousing that emerged as a direct consequence of the realization that having data by itself isn't really an answer to a question.From personal (professional) experience, there's probably a distinction between big-data when it comes to consumer data and big-data when it comes to IoT data. Cars are notorious for generating terabytes of data which is arguably mostly redundant. A car's CANbus will generate 10~100ms interval timeseries data with *very* high cardinality (e.g: pistons/injector states, temperatures, pressures, speeds) and there's only so much you can do with this data before you've pretty much completely defined the characteristics you're looking for.Industrial processes are no different, and while it's good to be able to do preventive maintenance (by, for instance, continuously running a regression of an engine's efficiency and plotting that efficiency change over thousands of miles), in general there isn't 'insight' to be driven the way marketers want to drive insight from users.I think the medical and genetics fields are probably the most likely candidates for getting deep insights.But let's also not forget that the folks over at CERN have been dealing with bigger data than any big-data in the commercial world for quite a while now. So it is trivial that as you approach the fundamental sciences, this stuff becomes more and more valuable.Also, it is my personal opinion that the biggest impediment or road-block to properly utilizing big-data is being able to *access* that data and navigate through it. If I gave you a 10ms timeseries with 100 dimensions of the last year and said ""find me problem areas"", you would have a hard time doing it easily. It is next to impossible to have it done by getting a tech to manually dump CSV files on a USB stick from PLCs in the field. So the infrastructure becomes quite critical to be able to pull off even the most basic intelligence."

learnmachinelearning;dbdsgr;1569859614.0;/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/dbdsgr/do_zscores_matter_in_machine_learning/;Do z-scores matter in machine learning?;A z-score tells you how many standard deviations a given data point lies from the mean. Z-scores thus describe individual data points rather than an entire distribution. Considering that, it's easy to imagine why a particular student who's taken, say, the SAT, might care about their z-score, because that student is the data point, and individual students matter.But in machine learning, the goal is super big data sets, and at least in my context which is NLP, individual data points matter far less than the overall distribution of data. A data point in NLP might be an n-gram or some feature value for a chunk of text. One data point in isolation will tell you nothing about the distribution, and contains no intrinsic value on it's own unlike the z-score of a student on a test.**So with that background, do z-scores ever matter in machine learning contexts? In a line, entire data SETS matter, but individual data POINTS don't really, so since z-scores pertain to individual data POINTS, what need is there for z-scores in machine learning?**I ask because I'm learning about z-scores, and am struggling to see how they might be relevant or why they're worth learning for someone with an eye to a career in machine learning.;When you have many predictor variables, especially if they differ wildly in scale, z scoring them all before fitting a model can help both with getting the model to fit properly (depending on the technique you’re using) and with interpretation after the fact. In multiple regression, for instance, if you’ve z scored all your continuous predictors, you can directly compare the magnitude of the coefficients to get something like an effect size.#z-score only comes into picture when you're dealing with gaussian variables. In NLP you're dealing with discrete variables.#Not every topic you're going to learn in math will have an obvious connection to application. While you're learning about Z-scores, you're really supposed to be learning about distributions generally. Its important that you have a solid intuitions about simple situations so that you can expand that understanding to the more complex situations you'll deal with later.   I think you should consider that you could create a similar argument about avoiding learning about negative numbers, because there are no such things as negative words or negative probabilities , and you just want to assign non-negative probabilities to positive number amount of not-negative words. That whole argument doesn't make sense when you consider logarithms, but if you don't know negatives you're unlikely to understand logs. So the reasoning doesn't always make sense, in advance.#Depends. In NLP it is less important but when you have lets say a multivariate regression you usually want to normalize your variables to be all on the same scale.#Multivariate regression is beyond me at this point. Does it take in z-scores as inputs for normalization?

I am currently investigating whether to finish these studies over the course of another 2 more years to get a bachelors degree or whether to give that up to have the capacity to learn on my own and work on my own projects. I am currently favoring the latter but I want to get input from people more familiar with the job market before making a decision. I will give a reasoning for each option.*# Finishing studiesWhen checking open positions, a degree is required in almost every case. Some mentioning ""extensive experience"" as substitute but I have only worked part-time for a year now, which I guess is insufficient. So far I have had no trouble with studies and have had rather good marks, probably somewhere in the upper 20% range. Giving up my studies might give a wrong expression to potential employers, thinking my skills are insufficient. Further, I would really like to write a thesis at some point.# Doing my own thingsMost of the time, lectures are boring me, possible reasons being:* I'm already familiar with some concepts* the lecture is too slow for me personally* the subject doesn't seem to be of much use for me in the future.I have found that I'm much faster and more efficient learning things on my own. I learn >70% within 3 days before an exam by reading books. Further, having more time available, would allow me to set priorities myself to increase motivation and gain a much deeper understanding of fields I consider important (e.g. Big Data). On top of that, so far I have been doing very well with building a portfolio of own projects and might even consider a start-up - for which I don't see the time or energy when having to focus on lectures and exercises. And in contrast to scheduled education, I'm much more disciplined when I can learn on my own and things I'm interested in.&#x200B *All in all, I'm currently strongly tending for the second option as I'm pretty sure it's much better for me personally in almost any aspect. However, the job market is the large counter-argument and I don't want to exclude myself from these better positions. I think I'm definitely skilled but that might not prevent employers from categorically rejecting me. For context, I'm targeting cutting edge markets such as Big Data, cryptocurrency, IoT and aiming for a supervising position (not being a programming resource) in the long run. I appreciate any personal experience and opinions for consideration.*";My advice or opinion:  You'll continue to regret dropping out for a long, long time.  Sure, you'll probably get some kind of a career going and find some kind of success.  But it will NOT be the same success you could access with a completed degree, and more importantly two more summer's worth of internship experiences.  I was you.  I dropped out of college in 1996 I believe it was.  Still don't have a degree.  Yes, I managed to find a career path that suited me.  But I entered the IT workforce in the era where anyone who actually understood how this stuff worked could get a job.  We get applications from a dozen college graduates for every open position we advertise.  You sure you wanna compete with that?  If you are bored with your current course load, then show some personal damned initiative and have a conversation with your student adviser about replacing easy courses with harder ones. Stop going with the flow and taking the easy-A. You're spending a lot of money to be bored. Are you sure you are as smart as you say you are?  >  I'm currently strongly tending for the second option as I'm pretty sure it's much better for me personally in almost any aspect.  No. You're pretty sure it will be EASIER, not better. You can do what you want, as opposed to what professors tell you to do.  If you are no longer a registered student, you can no longer access formal internship programs.  You'll be competing for full-time employment with graduates who not only have a completed education, but likely have internship experiences on their resumes.  You're going to have to complete on raw talent alone. Your resume will look weaker, because it is weaker.  Your GitHub is going to need to be impressive, and not just a little bit.  > I think I'm definitely skilled but that might not prevent employers from categorically rejecting me.  Some employers will indeed reject you for lack of a degree.  But not all. Some employers will give you a shot.  > I'm targeting cutting edge markets such as Big Data, cryptocurrency, IoT and aiming for a supervising position (not being a programming resource) in the long run.  Cutting Edge Markets == Start-up culture.  Start-ups love drop-outs.  No degree means no student loan pressure, which means lower initial salaries.  No degree means no formal education in contract negotiation, so they can push you around easier.  All in all, you are putting yourself at a career disadvantage.  For what advantage? Convenience? Boredom?  Bottom line?  Can your plan work? Yes. Yes it can.  Is your plan more likely or less likely to enable you to achieve career success compared to a traditional degree path? My opinion? Less likely.  But a smaller chance is not zero chance.  I hope you are as good as you think you are.  Good luck to you.#College just gets harder to finish with more life stuff on your plate. I am working on my degree now, with just about a year left at a decent pace, after multiple tries across two decades. I hadn't had the perfect storm of time, money, and motivation to finish past an AA and AS, and it's definitely taken longer to climb the ladder. Why disadvantage yourself? Having that degree helps you get the interview. Can your resume really explain your projects well enough for an employer to want to interview you? HR often just look for keywords and degrees, and will weight you against the other candidates when culling a list so the top 10 (or however many they want to interview) get interviews. I've been on multiple interview panels, and the candidates with a degree plus experience have a clear advantage. Plus, it shows that they can finish something that takes time and real effort. Get it while you're young, unmarried, untethered, etc. Finish school before you have much more enjoyable prospects jockeying for your time and attention. Good luck.#Thank you. Well, I honestly didn't think about the fact that HR is going through the applications. They would most likely go straight for those with a degree in most cases.#I've seen cases where we had a strong internal candidate without a degree that we wanted on the list... HR had to add the similar candidates who applied to make it fair, so we had to interview way more people than planned. Having to add days to an interview panel schedule can be expensive, with minimal payout. (I'm in local government)HR employees' narrow view of our specialties can be a real stumbling block. Best to arm yourself for maximum success. :)Good luck!

Or just moved?;Here we go again. This seems to crop up every couple of years. You'd think in the era of big data Spotify would know how people build playlists. I know I'm not the only person in existence who adds albums to playlists to serve as an intro to band in a playlist they listen to regularly. So why remove it, I don't get it. I know exactly where to find it because of muscle memory. Maybe it's moved but I have looked quite a bit to no avail.;Sometimes i dont know if Spotify understand the purpose of their app.
cscareerquestions;daugwo;1569759919.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/daugwo/what_university_doesnt_teach_you_about_your_first/;What university doesn't teach you about your first job;I have a job in Big Data Analytics. I realise some people (especially those entering into the field for the first time) have very idealistic views about how their job should be. They **expect**:\- a company will dutifully ensure it has technical expertise and fail-proof systems **before** venturing into Machine Learning (this has been the biggest source of disappointment),\- that all teams will have an amazing repository of beautiful models,\- everyone knows what they are doing. \- everyone will be completely honest about their capabilitiesIt's not completely bad to have these expectations, in an ideal world, all these expectations should be met. But the **sad truth** is, these are often not true.So, to those people who won't stop complaining: As Ray Dalio said, *Embrace Reality and Deal With It*. Having that mindset **doesn't** mean you should think that the current situation is justifiable. It means you should  stop complaining and wishing reality will converge to your ideals. Learn how to work with current reality, and see if you could change it for the better. If you think it's impossible, or if you don't want to try, nothing is stopping you from leaving.;"What they don't teach you is how to deal with people who brush their teeth at work.  Like, what's the protocol when you encounter them at the sink?  I can't help but think that all the particles wafting from my big dump our now being spread into their money forcefully with a brush.  How do I ask them about that kernel module when I just look at them in disgust the rest of the day?That's where our academic institutions fail us.#A common theme I noticed among entry level devs right out of school is they expect jobs to be a continuation of school. For example:""There is zero documentation and no one helps me through the massive codebase that I can't understand on my own! I'm expected to just figure everything out. This job sucks!""I've seen it in person and the mentality is especially pervasive in this sub. It is what it is, not my problem anymore.#This made me laugh out loud. But I feel like autocorrect changed some of your words because I didn't understand parts of what you were saying.#I'd say that junior developers are not expected to figure everything out on their own and should be asking lots of questions. Take full advantage of the time when everyone expects you to not know anything.#That's you. and in an ideal world, sure I agree. But not every company is like that as as OP states, the onus on the employee to adapt. Or leave - that's fine too. The world doesn't acclimate to the employee, it's the other way."

The compulsory syllabus covers the following:\-	Principles of Programming 1 (python)\-	Principles of Programming 2 (Java)\-	Fundamentals of Computing\-	Information Systems\-	Computer Systems\-	Data and Knowledge Management\-	Software Design and ProgrammingWe have to choose one of the following four modules:**Data Warehousing and Data Mining:*** This covers the organisation, analysis and mining of large data sets to support business intelligence applications* The principles and commercial application of Data Warehousing and Data Mining technologies, as well as research results and emerging architectures underpinning the analysis and mining of “big data”**Information and Network Security:*** Provides a broad coverage of the field of information security. This course covers the technical as well as the management side of security in information systems**Information Retrieval and Organisation:*** Introduces modern Information Retrieval concepts and techniques, from basic text indexing to advanced text mining and Web IR**Internet and Web Technologies:*** Provides students with an understanding of how network protocols work, particularly those used on the Internet, and the ability to present and manipulate information on the World Wide Web, with an emphasis on XML and JSON (also, HTML, XHTML)Although my choice should be determined by what my goals are and where I would like to be employed after the course, I don’t know enough CS yet to know what I like, where I would like to be employed, or what I will hopefully be good at. My overriding concern is to learn and develop an employable skill which won’t be redundant in 20-30 years. Aside from that, I also have a an interest in game design which I hope to pursue as a hobby in my spare time. Do any of the optional modules stand out as any better or more useful than the others in regards to employability?;[deleted]#They all look useful to me. I'd probably pick the last or first. But that's just personal preference.#Agreed. Most of everything nowadays is built on web technologies. Even cloud computing and microservices are usually just a bunch of REST apps chatting with each other. These things are a big learning curve for fresh college hires on my team.#Thanks for the reply

I'm currently doing my masters' second year on Bioinformatics. I have a BSc in Biotechnology so I'm more into de pipeline/analysis/stats field.I want to do a PhD after my masters but I don't want to stay in academia since from what I've seen so far it seems that academia is not stable as a job. That being said, I'm currently doing a research internship in a lab where I've been doing some data washing and curation as well as general pop gen pipelines and stats. I really like the lab (they are a really healthy group) and its main focus right now (population genetics).I really don't know what are the hot topics on industry/hospitals (what I'm aiming for) and I'm wondering if the skills I get from this population genetics anaylses are appreciated in a bioinformatician CV. I know that I'm getting some useful general skills such as profeciency in big data handling, Python, R and stats. But are the specific skills related to population genetics (variant calling, gwas, population structure, pedegrees and linkage desequilibrium) useful when looking for industry/hospital jobs? I don't know why but I see the whole field of population genetics only applied to academia.Thanks!;If you can get from VC to NGS analysis surely.#As a fellow bioinformatician  who work in the population genetics area, I can tell you that this experience will also help you in corporate sector as well. Lot of pharma companies are involved in population genetics.

SSD's as fast storage pool is perfectly fine.  With your useage profile I would doubt you would saturate the full ARC, but if you do L2ARC would benefid greatly from the M.2 slot, more so than your scratch drive. But again: Doubt you will saturate ARC enough to justify L2ARC just for data storage.   L2ARC gets increasingly more intesteresting when VM's are in the picture though.  I myself am also looking to build an energy efficient server (nas + vm's, so a little more hyperconverged than yours), I agree that bigger disks are the way to go when it comes to energy efficiency.   Don't forget your PSU! Considering your useageprofile there would be a relative big amount of downtime, so idle power consumption is key. Using 8 disks is awesome (because 3-5W per drive adds quickly), but also consider efficiency of your PSU.   If you don't want to use a picopsu, consider the  **Cooler Master V Series V550** .  Its known to be one of the most efficient ATX psu's when it comes to power efficiency, A real most have to be honest.  Maybe it would be worthwile adding what type of ZFS you are going to be running on both pools?  (DONT mix the ssd's and hdd's though.. really dont).  depending on use, it might be interesting going striped mirrors... It would saturate 10Gbe sequential (which I expect is the most comon load on bulk storage) on the 8 drive bulk storage.  Ehen used on the SSD's it would also saturate 10gbe it (might even get close with more random loads)  However, I doubt 40gbe is going to give you any benefid.  Your two pool will barely saturate 20gbe in the most damn ideal conditions and most tweaked config. Even then its unlikely. Even your scratch disks would quickly hit under 10gbe with slightly less ideal loads.#Build advice: Your ram looks good, for performance plan on the read/write cache. The Samsung pros in a raid should be fine. Labels on the drive trays will help when trying to find a bad drive. Plan a way to backup your high priority storage, Google drive with a paid account work wonders. Unpopular opinion incoming. I built a freenas box and ran it for 5-6 years before converting it to xpenology. When it came time to replace the hardware I opted for an 8 bay Synology. Freenas has the tendency to be high maintenance when it comes to updates. I found myself having to fix major issues or completely avoid updates to maintain a stable system. There were times where I was stuck on an unstable box unable to downgrade due to zfs updates. ZFS is definitely cool and has its upsides when it comes to storage. The filesystem itself leans toward keeping your data safe, but it is a hog when it comes to hardware. Hardware configs that would give you amazing performance saturating 10gbe will need to be significantly upgraded to do the same with zfs.#[deleted]#SLOG =/= (or even != ) write cache.  With 128GB L2ARCH does become interesting though, for the shitty low prices of NVME ssd's these days that could be interesting.   "" Labels on the drive trays will help when trying to find a bad drive. ""  \- Also add the serialnumber of the drive to the label.  "" Unpopular opinion incoming... ""  \- And Synology has BIG issues with data recovery when it fails. To each their own. With these specs I think synology also becomes uninterestingly expensive..  "" but it is a hog when it comes to hardware. ""  \- Ram is the biggest ""hog"", with 128gbe that's not really an issue of OP."" Hardware configs that would give you amazing performance saturating 10gbe will need to be significantly upgraded to do the same with zfs. ""  \- With 8 HDD disks in ZFS striped mirrors, you already can saturate 10gbe on sequential reads and writes. But at the very least he doesn't need ""upgrades"" to saturate 10gbe, his sata drives would be fine to saturate it.#RAID 10 on ZFS is a beast, cant go wrong there :)  If you go 40gbe regardless, well no loss in adding it to the storage system too ofcourse!  Certainly considering 40gb qsfp is getting darn cheap due to it being depricated for data centre use.  Anyhow: It seems you know your shit! :)"
analytics;d6huvh;1568916403.0;/r/analytics/comments/d6huvh/recommendations_on_interesting_data_analysis_or/;Recommendations on interesting data analysis (or similar topic, i.e. big data) books that I can read on my spare time?;Doesn't have to be very technical but more engaging and just kind of out-of-the-box reads that you found some value in, one way or another. And something that may be more easy to read for a beginner? Bonus points if it's something that is re-readable  something that you often find yourself looking through time and time again.Would love to hear about the title as well as the main thing you've learned from it/why you strongly recommend it?;One of the first books that I got, and that still helps me: Marketing Analytics - Data-Driven Techniques with Microsoft Excel, by Wayne L. Winston.Some reasons:1 - It uses Excel. So, this was really a positive thing for me in the beginning. It does not require expensive software, coding skills, advanced math knowledge, etc. And often the Excel formulas allowed me a better understanding of the reasoning behind a method than a powerful software that does everything automatically. A few chapters use StatTools for Excel, but not many.2 - I like the diversity of content, at least for marketing purposes. Some of the most relevant methods (e.g., regression, conjoint analysis, ANOVA) and contexts (e.g., pricing, segmentation, advertising, internet marketing). A lot of that can be adapted to be used outside of marketing.3 - The whole book is like step-by-step examples with screenshots. You learn by actually doing the analysis. And I guess that's the best way.4 - You can usually go straight to what you want. Like, if you want to read chapter 35 because you want to know about media selection models, you can go directly to that chapter, you probably don't need to know or remember the 34 chapters before that.So, of course it's not the most advanced or complete book ever. But I think it's a very good starting point (at least it was for me). Of course, later on you can get all fancy with equations, statistical software, coding skills, advanced methods.#I’m relearning Excel so this will be a great book for me, I can already tell (: Now, I’d mostly be reading this outside of a computer/office environment, is it something that I can really “read” without doing it in Excel? This won’t be all the time, but I’m looking for this to be more of a supplement while I’m away from my desk, for the most part.#Yeah, you can read without doing it in Excel. The book is usually a lot of step-by-step instructions  (click here, select that cell, choose this option, write this formula, etc.) with lots of screenshots. So, it's almost like watching someone else doing it, and explaining it to you along the way.  But you need to know Excel to understand what he is doing. Some explanation is provided about things like pivot tables and solver. But if he uses solver and you don't know what a solver is, then it will be much more confusing to just read.And, of course, just reading instructions without being able to do anything might be quite boring. Step-by-step instructions are very useful, but not exactly something exciting to read.

Best 4g offer I could find without a long term contract is Lyca mobile, however I am told the ""unlimited data"" only covers 60gb/month. Does anyone know to what speed it is reduced after that?";Every network in the country (except Vodafone, Postmobile and Eir) is a virtual network using Three's signal.You'll get better performance by going directly to Three than by using a virtual network - and Lycamobile are notorious as being the worst of the virtual networks.Three is €20/month. You get 60GB, after this they ~~reserve the right to~~ **won't** slow you down. The actual limit you get cut off at is 2TB.Eir is also €20/month. You get 80GB, after this they will slow you down to a pretty much useless speed.Vodafone's largest allowance is 25GB so it's not suitable for you. Postmobile use Vodafone's signal - they're the only virtual network who don't use Three - but they only offer 16GB so they're also not suitable for you.Also, if you're in Longford Town itself, you should contact Crossan Cable, the town's cable TV/broadband operator. They're family run and operate their own network, so they may have the flexibility to offer you a short contract for cable broadband.#Thank you so much! That really helped.About Three - That would be the 3Pay SIM tariff, right?In the terms and conditions it statesThe Service is available for use with your SIM Card in your handset only. Tethering or use of your handset as, or the SIM in conjunction with, a modem is not allowed, except in the case of Three customers who  have subscribed to a Three handset and Tablet bundle offering. In the  event that we identify that you have breached this condition, Three  reserves the right to suspend, modify or restrict your use of the  Service or to withdraw your access to the Service at its absolute  discretion.Do you think they'd actually block my number if I use it to watch netflix on my xbox or play online? Probably depends just on my usage, right?Edit: By Crossan Cable you mean Cable comm? I went there and they wanted to charge us up to 170EUR for a modem that could fit a sim card with LTE. Also, as far as I know my non-irish EU number will get blocked/charged extra after like 4 months, so I'd need an Irish number anyway.#You won't be cut off. Three don't give a damn if you abuse their service even if it's badly affecting other customers.Half the country does it without issue - and if you do somehow manage to get yourself cut off or throttled just buy another SIM.

That said, the reason I haven’t is that I’ve found plenty of advice via Google to understand what to put on a resume. I think the better question is whether it makes sense for you to take all the time you would to research what you need to in order to create a good resume. If you can pay reasonably for it and it allows you to spend more time applying, interviewing, and writing cold emails, then I’d do it. However, in my experience, people who want to hire someone to do it for them are not taking the time to research and learn what goes into a good resume because it takes work. What you may need to ask yourself is whether you’re paying someone to do it to avoid the intangible cost of not being able to pursue more opportunities OR if you want someone else to do it because you’re not taking the initiative and time to research it yourself.

I will be implementing machine learning techniques within a healthcare framework. I will be given access to public health info (big data sets) and also given access to use cloud computing. Now, for the sake of not wasting the companies money (pay per instance) they are giving me a $2000 stipend to purchase a laptop to use and be somewhat capable of running machine learning code and not use their cloud space until I need to run the heavy duty models. Now, my first thought was to get a laptop with a solid GPU and go from there. Also, I believe I will using TensorFlow so if I want to use the GPU capabilities for TF I need a Nvidia card. Do I really need a heavy duty laptop to run machine learning code for ""toy problems"" before using the cloud service? Or can I just get a solid laptop with a good CPU and not worry about the GPU?";depends on the task really. I'm a data science grad student and mostly do my personal work on google colab and college projects on my lab's aws account.I recently did a project on GANs on my friends' 4GB 1050Ti and couldn't complete it as cuda kept running out of memory, so had to transfer the project to colab.But even colab has it's own hassles, like 12 hrs session, after which it resets.You can even get a Paperspace account with fair amount of resources for 2k if you already have a laptop.Or get a much bigger gpu configuration on your new laptop. But I wouldn't recommend that as you'll have to stick with that machine even when it gets outdated.#Razer blade pro 17 (2019) It is a slim laptop that carries a professional MacBook like design but with 10x the capabilities. It’s best features are that it comes with the 9th gen i7 9750H and RTX 2080 Max-Q. It’s only got 16gb of ram, but it’s upgradeable to 64. It also only has a 512gb ssd but it’s upgradeable to 2tb. It can easily handle everything you need it to do for years to come. You likely won’t need to upgrade again for 3-5 years. My next recommendation would be the razer blade 15 4K OLED with the RTX 2080.#I mentioned Paperspace as I found it to be cheaper, you can do a bit more research to find better deals imo#i was searching for a laptop too and possibly i will take one of your recommendations, thanks you very much!

apps;d6scag;1568971373.0;/r/apps/comments/d6scag/analytics_without_numbers_viewing_products/;Analytics without numbers: Viewing products through users’ eyes; Here are two things you’ll hear a lot from product teams:1. A lot of data is needed to reduce uncertainty and get an accurate picture of users’ needs and behavior.2. People working on products understand and know their users well.The above statements are misconceptions, and in both cases, the reverse is true. In this post, I will discuss how analyzing user behavior without big data (debunking the first premise) will help us avoid the unpleasant outcomes of thinking you already know your users (debunking the second premise).&#x200B https://preview.redd.it/88vipkk0upn31.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=b21e3674dec84c5ba58e8d0c20a31a9854492731## First misconception: We need a lot of data to reduce total uncertaintyImagine an infinite sized pool of black and white balls. Your task is to find out the share of white balls. Initially, you are in a state of complete uncertainty. How much data do you need to find the answer to this question?If you take 100 random balls and calculate the proportion of white balls, then you will know the answer with an accuracy of ± 9.8%. If you add another 100 balls, you will increase the accuracy of your answer to ± 6.9%  Add 200 more balls—you are up to ± 4.9%. Another 600 balls—up to ± 3.1%. With 9,000 more balls, you will achieve ± 1% accuracy.Did you notice that the first 100 balls gave us a lot more knowledge than the next 100, and going from 100 to 200 balls had much more impact on the accuracy than the 1,000-10,000 range?Let’s keep this in mind and move on to the second misconception.## Second misconception: People working on products understand and know their users wellThe second misconception assumes we understand the products we are working on.The truth is, we don’t.We are always looking for ways to close the gap between the product model we envision and the actual product we build. To do so, we try out new tools and approaches, communicate with users, conduct experiments and analyze data.The goal behind all of these activities is simple. We want to improve our understanding of the product and users, to find opportunities for growth and development, and to increase the proportion of the right decisions we make.## Viewing the product through users’ eyesWhat was this long introduction about? I want to introduce you to a method that will allow you to learn a lot about your product. It is very simple:*Take a few users and observe how they use your product.*No, you don’t have to conduct an interview with these users. There’s also no need to calculate the metrics that characterize their behavior in the product. We literally need to take a specific user and monitor how she interacts with the product throughout her entire period of usage.How can you do it? If you already have event logging set right in the product, it is very simple:1. Select the group of users you want to study (you will need different users to get answers to different questions).2. For each user of this group, create a sequence of all the events they generate, including the event parameters, from the time they start using the product.3. You will end up with a sequence of events for each user in your product. You can divide this sequence into separate sessions for convenience.You can also do it with the help of Amplitude’s User Look-Up tool.&#x200B https://preview.redd.it/ipuswcvivpn31.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3c8bd79c01e2b2f9fe851e94b266fe2a9e253aNow you have everything you need to view the product through the user’s eyes. Look at the sequence of events and start analyzing it. Take notes along the way.You will observe what the user does while going through the onboarding and afterward, what difficulties she encounters along the way, at what point her first session ends, whether she has experienced the product’s value by that time, when does she retain and how long it takes her to do so, and much more.Now, let’s go back to the first misconception. Studying a small number of users (50-100) with this method will help you find out the following:1. How and why do people use your product?2. What problems do they face at different stages in your product?3. How does the actual usage differ from what you designed the product for4. Which users tend to stay and which tend to leave? What are the differences between them?Another benefit of doing this type of analysis is that it helps you come up with a bunch of hypotheses that you can test/validate through data analysis, experiments or user research.## Case studies of analyzing user behavior through session analysisThe method we described above solves a wide range of tasks, so it can be considered quite universal. Here are a few cases where session analysis proved to be very useful.## Yandex Maps RedesignRedesigning any old popular service is extremely risky. It’s very important not to break any of the existing use cases in the new design.A few years ago, I worked on the redesign of the web version of [Yandex Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.yandex.yandexmaps&hl=en), the most popular online map service in Russia and CIS market with over 30 million users. Due to the complexity and scale of the task, we wanted to make sure we understood thoroughly all the use cases our users have. To do that we decided to manually analyze user sessions.We selected a few hundred random users, manually examined their sessions, categorized them, and wrote down our observations. The result was a table of existing product use cases and their popularity.You might argue that this approach was not necessary, that we could have just calculated the share of people who used the product to build routes, those who checked the traffic jams, or searched for organizations, etc. But these quantitative indicators would have hidden a lot of useful and critical information about the way people solve their problems with the product.It turned out, for example, that different people used the same features and solved similar tasks in completely different ways. And it was something we should have considered in the new version of the product.In the process, we made a number of unexpected discoveries. For example, it seemed obvious to us that in the task “to find an organization on a map -> find out how to get there,” users build a route directly from the organization’s snippet (see the orange arrow in the screenshot).In reality, however, it turned out that only a small percent of users did this. Most users simply copied the address of the organization and pasted it in the routes tab to build a new route (see the green arrow on the screenshot).I don’t know any other way to learn about such unexpected twists in users’ behavior other than tracking their events and examining their sessions. And the fact that such behavior exists entails many questions. Creating routes directly from the organization’s snippet is clearly easier than copy-pasting its address in the route tab. Why are users missing it? Is the organization’s featured snippet overloaded with data? Are users not noticing the button?&#x200B https://preview.redd.it/vn74eyprvpn31.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6680d99c57ba6d78acd2b7eac206799b6902e1d## Finding problems in the first versions of [King of Thieves](https://www.kingofthieves.com/)When creating products, we usually assume people are going to use them in the “correct” way. We design a product in a way that helps users discover its core value as soon as possible.Surprisingly, “silly” users always do everything in their own way instead of the way we anticipate. This is exactly what happened with the first versions of King of Thieves.King of Thieves is a mobile game in which you have to break into dungeons and steal treasures and gems. You can play the game in single-player mode, but the true value of the game is in its competitive multiplayer mode. The key feature of the game is to steal gems from other players to become the wealthiest thief. At the same time, players must defend their own treasures and build traps in order to stop rivals from stealing their treasures.King of Thieves turned out to be a very successful game—but the launch of its first version was a disaster.The game’s retention was a poor 26%. Most players left the game shortly after they tried it and never came back.To understand the reasons behind this, we looked at the user sessions in the way described above. We wanted to understand what was wrong.The core value of the game was in its multiplayer mode. When creating the game’s onboarding, we assumed that we would show how the game mechanics work in the first levels of the single-player campaign, and then players would switch to the multiplayer mode when they were ready. That’s exactly why we made a huge red multiplayer button after all!&#x200B https://preview.redd.it/w3acnritvpn31.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=775a2a7c38efeba6f144b1ced735518e7c4fe300But it turned out that most users simply went through the single-player levels without ever paying attention to the multiplayer game mode. After some time, they got stuck in a difficult level, or just got bored, and abandoned the game.There were few who switched to multiplayer, but in most cases the players saw no difference from the single-player mode. The opponent either had no gems to steal, or he did, but when players completed the level, they weren’t awarded the gem, even though stealing gems from other players was part of the game’s core loop.After analyzing the sessions of several hundred users (the sessions were very short, so it didn’t take us too long), we figured out that less than 10% of users had a chance to experience the essence of the game in their first few sessions. Those who grasped it were much more likely to keep playing the game.Of course, we should not forget that at that point, this was just a correlation—it did not necessarily mean that players kept playing the game because of that experience. Nonetheless, it was a good starting point, and the hypothesis that walking more users through this experience will improve the metrics was worth testing.We could have probably found this problem through metrics alone: We would see that a very small percentage of new users try the multiplayer mode. And in most cases, those who do try do not steal gems from their opponents. But we didn’t know exactly what we were looking for or when we needed to pay our attention. Perhaps everything was fine, and players simply didn’t find the mechanics of the game entertaining enough.We launched a new version of the game in which we walked players through the multiplayer mode in the onboarding and also made sure that when players attack a dungeon, there’s a gem for them to retrieve and they actually get it after completing the level. As a result, the game metrics significantly improved: Day 1 retention soared from 26% to 41%, while Day 7 retention increased from 9% to a healthier 20%.While examining the sessions and looking at the product through the eyes of our users, we found the stark contradiction between what players experienced and what we wanted them to actually experience.## Optimizing the Funnel of adding a flight in [App in the Air](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/app-in-air-best-flight-tracker/id527299553)Here is a wonderful example that Bayram Annakov shared in his [blog](https://medium.com/@bayramannakov/funnel-analysis-investigating-why-users-drop-6cccbbe41968#.d6c2vl77l).  https://preview.redd.it/5fpv3whuvpn31.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d2397e4b7cd3a877827bc5ab4b466f4031c3c5fApp in the Air is a mobile app that keeps track of your itineraries, boarding passes, and frequent-flier programs. The application helps ease the frustration and complexities of finding and managing flights.However, the product team found that 30% of users of the App in the Air didn’t add a flight after opening the app screen where they were expected to do that.The problem turned out to be pretty trivial, as has been the case in many similar problems. The users would search for the name of the airline or airport they sought in their native language—the search worked only in English.The funnel demonstrated that 30% of users churn at a certain step, but in order to find out why, it was necessary to go one level deeper and look at what exactly people were doing at that step.After making sure all the app’s localized languages were considered, the churn rate at this funnel step declined from 30% to 5%.## Personal sales firstY Combinator co-founder Paul Graham has an iconic essay titled “[Do things that don’t scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html).” One of the things Graham mentions is that founders should personally find their first customers and help them onboard into their product, serving as a tutorial manual in a way.Why? Because it gives the opportunity to look at your product through users’ eyes, which in turn allows you to quickly find points your users don’t understand, where they find the maximum value, and what is and isn’t important to them.It is true that this can be labor intensive and not fun at all. It is way easier and less stressful to look at a drop in the funnel at a specific step than to seek and observe lack of understanding in real people to whom you’ve recently spoken about all the advantages of your service.Personal sales work great for B2B products. In fact, session analysis is a variation of this approach that is more suitable for B2C products (though it can also work for B2B). Now you can select the users you need and study them in detail, like in the previous example with App in the Air, where users reached the screen where they could add a flight, but for some reason didn’t complete the step.Moreover, you can also contact these users personally later and ask them the questions you have in mind. This will make the overall picture as complete as possible.## Pros and cons of analyzing user sessions manuallyAnalyzing user sessions will give you a more decent understanding of how people are using your product. This is not an abstract knowledge of how various popular features and conversion of various funnel steps work, but a vivid idea about your users’ paths within the product from the moment they start using it until they either churn or your service becomes a part of their life.Another bonus of such an analysis is making it easier for you to work on new things in the product. Having a clear picture of the current paths of your users inside the service, you can better predict how and at what stage the planned changes will affect them. This increases your chances of making the right decision.Unlike using metrics, this method loses much less information along the way. But, as is usually the case, it also has its disadvantages. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to compare different versions of the product based on the manual session analysis method. You will have to analyze too many of them to obtain statistically significant results. In this case, metrics, cohort analysis, and A/B tests will help you.## Summing it upMany think that analytics is all about numbers and mathematics. In my opinion, analytics should help you to understand your product and answer questions you have about it. Numbers and metrics can help with this and solve some problems rather well, but you should not limit yourself to them. For some tasks, other approaches, including manual session analysis, will do a much better job.Try examining the session of 50 users of your product. If you don’t find anything interesting, you’ve only lost a few hours of your time. However, and I can bet on it, you will probably find a few pleasant surprises.;Thank you for this insightful article. Learnt the importance of visual analytics, although ethically it is a big no-no, specially when it comes to apps with sensitive info.#Thank you for your nice words!

AskAcademia;d5migw;1568751198.0;/r/AskAcademia/comments/d5migw/looking_to_switch_to_consultancy_in/;Looking to switch to consultancy in Canada/UK/Australia with a PhD/MSc in Biomedical Sciences;Hi all,I fell for the big ponzi scheme that is academia, currently finishing my PhD dissertation in biomedical sciences, and am bit burned out with life in academia for now. So I'm looking for a switch, I'm around 30 years old, so I hope that's also not too old. Better late than never right?The country where I'm living in now (the Netherlands), has quite a few of opportunities when it comes to switching to consultancy, like doing trainseeships (McKinsey and BCG, but also a lot of secondment agencies). I would like to dip my toes into the business analyst aspects, and focus on how to handle (and apply) big data and machine learning. Hopefully future-proofing myself if I ever decide to switch careers again.I was wondering if there are similar programs/traineeships being offered in the UK, Canada or Australia for people with my background (Biomed MSc or PhD)? These countries specifically cause my foreign girlfriend (non-dutch) wants to a PhD in one of those countries. Tl dr Basically could anyone tell me how the market is for someone with a PhD in biomedical sciences and looking to switch to business analytics? I'm willing to receive a low salary in the first years, as long as I get proper/certified training. Thank you for your time and reading.;I'm in that struggle right now. Canadian medical science PhD student. Look at any major pharma company, biotech company, or financial consulting company. Oh regarding the job market, it's quite good. A guy I knew got hired by BCG straight out of PhD. At a conference I went to they sent reps from a major financial consulting agency to get cross trained in pharma because there is a shortage of science trained people in business.
college;d9uuu3;1569555823.0;/r/college/comments/d9uuu3/double_major_a_minor_and_a_duel_degree_all_in/;Double Major, A minor, and a Duel Degree all in four years?;"Alright hear me out.I am currently a Freshman in University and have been thinking about declaring my major next week. I know it's pretty early but let me explain. I'm currently enrolled in ""The School of Business"", because I don't want to pursue either an art's degree or engineering one. For any business related major there are six core classes, and six electives. While talking to the dean of business, he stated most kids don't realise the only thing separating a minor from a double major is either one or two classes. So I'm thinking about Double Majoring in Marketing and Business Administration. The other aspect is I want to eventually move back to Europe (lived there for a couple of years previously) and to get my Masters in Marketing Data Analytics. My school currently offer a minor in Business Analytics, comparable with big data and data analytics. Thus I'm also considering minoring in Business Analytics, to give me an edge in my Masters Program and to have it on my resumé anyways. Lastly, My school offers a duel degree program where I would go to a university in Europe and study there for either one or two years (depending on location and which program I choose). The great side about this is that in addition to graduating form my University with its own degree, I also would graduate from the partner with my major and a major in European Management. The program I'm currently looking at has a mix of courses required for the Business Administration and Marketing degrees. On paper it sounds wonderful, and when I was discussing the idea of all of this with the Dean he simply asked, ""do you like electives?"". To which I responded, ""no, I would like to be in a class that I know I'm going to get use out of because other wise I don't see any need in paying for it."" He then responded, ""Theoretically it could work out, the challenge would be the course loads, and the scheduling"". By course loads I'm assuming he either means the fact that I would be learning about business functions for 8 hours a day everyday (which doesn't really bother me anyways due to the fact that I love business) or the fact that I might have to take 18 credit hours or overload in order to meet a 4 year plan. Some more info: The school I currently attend has an excellent partnership and abroad programs for the U.S. Currently I pay just under 30k a year to attend, and that is already including financial aid. Thus I ask you, is it worth it to try and do all of this? Looking at the prospect I think I could do it. Yes I realise it would be a real challenge... but just being able to put on a resumé for jobs, ""Major in Marketing, Major in Business Admin, Major in European Management, minor in Business Analytics"" combined with a school from America and one in Europe is really enticing.";Pretty dependent on how much overlap there is between the programs and how much incoming credit you came in with. I’m doing a dual degree+minor and it’s pretty tight even with the AP credit I brought.Also, consider just how much benefit the combination of those programs would bring. Will a degree in European Management/major in Business Admin help in the types of roles you’d be applying for? And if not, is the extra courses+time really worth it?#If you can do it, I'd say do it. You seem to want to, and it sounds like you're unfazed by the potentially challenging or dull aspects. What's the worst that could happen? Probably that you drop one program and still have an impressive-looking degree. Just remember not to let meeting requirements get in the way of good grades, and that it's okay to be ambitious and still need to take a step back. Also know that your priorities might change, and don't forget that it's important to have time to build your resume with more than just class, and to enjoy yourself.#So I brought in 18 credits from my IB diploma, so five pre-req courses worth. As for the overlap, due to the major requirements for Business, I only take the six core classes, and then the six electives for each of the majors. In total its 18 classes, and if I add the minor into the mix its another 4 classes due to the core already being satisfied. I should also elaborate and say that the program in Europe I'm currently looking at has me doing 2 core business classes, and then elective courses for Business Admin and Business Marketing respectfully. In my mind, if I don't double major then I'm essentially wasting 3 elective courses. The Degree in European Management doesn't have any additional classes, I receive it upon completing the program. My ultiment goal is to get my Masters for Marketing Data Analytics in Europe, and relocate there. Job, family, everything. So I'm thinking that having a degree in Europe that pertains to the European Market will put me in an entirely new bracket, especially when applying for masters programs. While Marketing is my main source of focus, the minor will be helpful as it eventually what I plan in getting my masters. Its a combination of both the marketing side of business and the data side. Business Admin is sort of a backup major incase Marketing would fall through for whatever reason.

Any experience on these?Help :D;Screen is probably going to be about the same.&#x200B The jack issue shouldn't be much of an issue unless you like listening to music WHILE you charge your phone.&#x200B The S8 is a 2 year old phone, so from starters it WILL have a 1-2 year old battery, which in turn probably means, less battery duration throughout the day.&#x200B The S8 being an older phone will probably receive less future updates if software is something that matters to you.&#x200B Good camera is a very subjective topic depending on the use you plan for the camera, so you should research image quality reviews for both.&#x200B Point is, depends on what you value, and since no one is you, you'll have to decide for yourself.&#x200B If you asked me, I'd buy new phone over used phone if same price.#I haven't bought phones or researched them in a while. Was thinking the same thing as you, but wasn't sure if flagships where better compared to some mid range phones. My friend is telling my S8 serves him good, but that's up until now. What about 1,2 years from now? Maybe no more updates and stuff.Always feels better to have a new phone that is supported properly.  Thanks for the points, buying the SE.

I am in my final data science course before my capstone next Spring (and then finally done!) and it's been a pain of a course. The course is about Big Data, but it feels more like an Operating Systems course I had back when I was working towards my Computer Science degree 15 years ago. I am a data analyst/assessment specialist trying to understand the practical use of Hadoop, MapReduce, and Spark, but all I see in the lecture notes are diagrams and letters that don't make a lot of sense. Has anyone found some good practical examples of these technologies. Secondly, is there a good list of practical expectations I should know when I state in my CV that I am trained in Hadoop and Spark? So far this all feels extremely conceptual.;Tbf, the use-case of hadoop and subsequently, spark, is really relatively small compared to other technologies. The issue I found when I was learning hadoop was you don't really have access to a ridiculously large dataset that would justify the need to use big data technologies.   (also, yep big data does feel sometimes like an operating systems class)Otoh, if you really do wanna use these, a great learning practice is to use AWS EMR clusters, as these distributed systems are where hadoop lives on. To justify the use of hadoop, you'll need a sufficiently large dataset, and that's hard to find. What I suggest is learning pyspark, and use the built-in machine learning stuff there, so there's a somewhat justifiable reason to use big data technologies. Then just do the processing all on your rdds, the map and reduce methods, (which are all map-reduce operations done on your hadoop cluster on your EMR), do the pyspark ML thing,  and that's it :D#For real world aoplications of the above stack, have a look at network/security analytics: Apache Metron, Apache Spot and combined in a portable format HELK. Ingesting raw network traffic will make you re-question the need for a data lake almost immediately =]

I'm looking for any sort of guidance and advice.  Graduated with a degree in Economics and couldn't land an entry level job to save my life.

I owned my own small meat market for five years before that while going to school!Due to various family circumstances I moved around a lot after college. (TX, OH, and CA) .My goal is to finally obtain employment more related in my field of study/interests.  Essentially I would like to leave the client facing/retail positions behind and begin focusing on something more technical and behind the scenes.I've been at my current job for about 18 months or so and since owning my own business it's been my longest tenured position.&#x200B Would love to pivot more into Technology/ FinTech.  I recently obtained my ITIL v4 foundations cert- hoping that would help show that I have some knowledge in the field on a basic level.  I'm decent with Excel but I needed a bit more reinforcement.  I'm currently taking an Excel course through Udemy.  I want to be able to work on big data sets and show that i'm more than proficient.&#x200B Again, I really don't even know how to approach this.

I wanna go more into data engineering/ML type role and I’ll definitely be put on teams that are catered to this area but idk about the specifics of what I’d be working on. I asked them to match up to State Farm but they haven’t so I might try again. (Any tips on how to get the base up higher would be very appreciated as well)Also both are in low cost of living area in Dallas, TXWhat sounds like the best option given this information?;I'd pick State Farm because they are deeply involved in the local DevOps community. State Farm is supposed to have a great stack as well. Be sure to also look at benefits and PTO. If one gives you a week more that can break the tie.#5k is not a huge difference my man. after a few paychecks you will not notice it. both are great offers, congratulations. insurance is great, people always want insurance. state farm has a good reputation in my opinion. AT&T would be a great opportunity as well - probably more technology focused as a whole I would imagine. the opportunity to work as the place that housed Bell Labs sounds pretty awesome to me (I don't think it exists anymore though).

Entrepreneur;d9x7tm;1569571432.0;/r/Entrepreneur/comments/d9x7tm/healthtech_startup_at_their_wits_end/;Healthtech startup at their wit's end;"This is part rant and part asking for advice regarding starting up a healthtech startup in today's day and age. My co-founder and I started this around a year ago. With his extensive knowledge as a certified nurse, we figured this would be a good cause to delve into make our mark. We knew it'll be difficult but didn't know how difficult until we were met with what it seems be resistance from all fronts.We're having problems getting the healthcare professionals on board, even when we've built the product to their requirements. They weren't impressed and wanted more, more and more, just ludicrous amount of features including AI and big data, which we've stressed that it's impossible if we don't start from the basics first. Not only did they refuse to use the app for testing, they left us hanging by the way side.Since then, we decided to move up with the Ministry of Health instead. Surely if big brother likes it, anything goes right? Technically, they do like the idea and is willing to help with R&D on our product. However, that has been all talk, for the past month, then it's all silence from them. Not to mention with all the government red tapes they impose, we're beginning to wonder if it's worth it to work with the government with this product. Oh and they're pretty clear that they won't be funding the project, simply giving ""advice"" in terms of research and the ""exposure"" to the public - so there's that.Now we're debating whether to move away from the Ministry and simply focus on the people instead. I.e. an app built for users without involving healthcare professionals as a start - perhaps we can try again after we've built our reputation up as the goal is to help them with their day to day jobs. Another option would be to forego starting up here and venture else where. Currently we're both working full time so it's probably difficult to travel out constantly. This would be a good way to find investors which are non-existent in this country unless you know some inside people.There's also the problem of monetization which both parties (public and professionals) are reluctant to discuss as it's considered ""taking advantage of the sick"", to quote them. Another hurdle to overcome in order to sustain ourselves.tl dr To the healthtech entrepreneurs of the world, we need some pointers - I feel like we've taken a lot of missteps and don't know how best to approach this. Are we rushing it? Are we approaching this the wrong way? How did your startup flourish? Any advice would help greatly, we're not planning to give in anytime soon but we we'd at least want to do this properly than blindly moving in the dark based on our instincts. Thanks in advance!";I think you're severely underestimating how difficult it is to change anything in the healthcare industry.Getting help from healthcare professionals is hard. They're extremely overworked. If you're looking at doctors and surgeons, you're looking at people who spend an extremely long time learning how to work the way they are and are very disinclined to change that. And from the organization's perspective, every change means new liabilities.The government doesn't have an opinion. They want to keep the machine running. Unless you have an already proven and effective way to cut costs or improve healthcare statistics in a cost-effective way that meets all of the criteria for easy adoption. They won't do anything for you.Focussing on end-users is nice if it pays the bills. But it won't do anything for your reputation with government and healthcare unless your app meaningfully changes statistics for the better.That's why everyone is talking to you about AI, machine learning and big data. Across the board the goals are essentially:&#x200B * reduce workload and/or cost* improve statistical outcomes (fewer deaths, reduce recovery periods, increased treatment success, reduce liability situations and so on)* new measures should easily fit into existing processes. Doesn't mess up preexisting vendor contracts, doesn't require extensive new training, doesn't require unusual approval processes and so onIf you can't even measure the effectiveness of your product, you got nothing on your hands but a nuisance.There's a reason the pharma industry is ruled by billion-dollar businesses. Introducing new products into the medical industry is a process of years and more often decades of work and hundreds of millions of dollars.Medical universities might be interested in working with you but they're more likely to expect you to pay them than the other way around. Funding PhD applicants to research your product and it's applications is a workable path forward.

ausjobs;d5nppp;1568756509.0;/r/ausjobs/comments/d5nppp/looking_to_switch_to_consultancy_in/;Looking to switch to consultancy in Canada/UK/Australia with a PhD/MSc in Biomedical Sciences;Hi all,I fell for the big ponzi scheme that is academia, currently finishing my PhD dissertation in biomedical sciences, and am bit burned out with life in academia for now. So I'm looking for a switch, I'm around 30 years old, so I hope that's also not too old. Better late than never right?The country where I'm living in now (the Netherlands), has quite a few of opportunities when it comes to switching to consultancy, like doing trainseeships (McKinsey and BCG, but also a lot of secondment agencies). I would like to dip my toes into the business analyst aspects, and focus on how to handle (and apply) big data and machine learning. Hopefully future-proofing myself if I ever decide to switch careers again.I was wondering if there are similar programs/traineeships being offered in the UK, Canada or Australia for people with my background (Biomed MSc or PhD)? These countries specifically cause my foreign girlfriend (non-dutch) wants to a PhD in one of those countries.Tl dr Basically could anyone tell me how the market is for someone with a PhD in biomedical sciences and looking to switch to business analytics? I'm willing to receive a low salary in the first years, as long as I get proper/certified training. Thank you for your time and reading.;Hardest part for you is getting residency status here in Australia. Very few companies are willing to sponsor permanent residency or employ people who are not permanent residents, especially for someone who has no working background.

Please refer to the following content.Due to the iteration and explosive development of the blockchain industry, many predictions will come true. Blockchain technology shocks the traditional financial industry with the ""code is law"", is also eroding the foundation of the Internet world and infrastructure construction.No matter big data or artificial intelligence is based on secure storage, value exploitation, and privacy protection. Especially in the era of data, the ability to handle and process data has become a race among major business giants.Data storage is a key technology, not only is the infrastructure for information retention, but also is a core asset to build business models and specific products. According to the research report of international data company IDC, the total global data storage in 2016 is 16.1ZB (1ZB=1024 (3rd power) TB) and maintains a compound annual growth rate of 40%. The total amount of data is expected to increase to 163ZB (175 billion) by 2025.Storage has become the core market for enterprise service competitionSource: Public Cloud Market Forecast 2015-2026According to the ""Public Cloud Market Forecast 2015-2026"" report published by Wikibon, the global cloud storage market scale will maintain a compound growth rate of 20% from 2015 to 2026, and the revenue is expected to reach $493 billion in 2026. Among them, the annual compound growth rates of PaaS, SaaS and IaaS are all above 18%.Source: The TOP 50 Blockchain Company - ForbesTechnical giants like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are dominating the data market. In China, companies like Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, 360, etc. provide storage services for billions of Internet users and enjoy huge profits, leading to high computing services prices.The migration of Storage MethodFrom hardware storage to cloud storage, from centralized to decentralized storage, storage migration has been the subject of the past decade, and the trend is accelerating to decentralization.Blockchain technology first time raised a thinking of cloud storage through technology and economic aspect that decentralized storage based on the blockchain should be cheaper, safer, faster, and more widely distributed than current cloud storage solutions.In the rise of decentralized storage, we can see the well-known projects like IPFS and Filecoin, Sia, Storj, DxChain, Swarm, ""the first landing application of decentralized storage"" bitdisk and so on.The competition of decentralized storage and enterprise servicesWe are paying close attention to the competition of distributed storage and the potential players, including the high attention projects IPFS and Filecoin and different competitors. Since it is hard to measure the true value of decentralized projects as that of centralized storage companies, we try to analyze the characteristics of Filecoin/DxChain/Sia from the perspectives of commonality, technical features and business models.Decentralized storage project: Filecoin / DxChain / Sia1. Commonality: Decentralization/storage cost is based on secondary market/business model is explorating2. Technology Character:1) Similar blockchain infrastructure of Filecoin and Bitdisk 2) Sia is created based on Bitcoin network 3) The technical architecture of DxChain is “Chains-on-chain” which includes the main chain, storage chain and computing chain.To be more specific, Filecoin aims to build a data storage network with file storage, transfer and trade, however, it’s hard to realize and develop. The consensus algorithm of Sia is PoW which is unsuitable to apply to economical products.DxChain is a storage public chain with complete functions of development, storage and computing. Compared with Ethereum, DxChain adds storage functions  compared with other storage public chain, DxChain will implement data computing function  compared with the development public chain, DxChain combines storage and computing functions. Additionally, the commercial applicability of DxChain is stronger. As a business or a developer of Dapp, DxChain eliminates the time and cost of searching for additional data storage and computing. Moreover, compatibility of Ethereum Virtual Machines and smart contracts, making the whole system more developer-friendly when developers deploying different types of applications to DxChain.Lightning Network improves the storage speed, since:1) Anyone can process the node verification, greatly improved the transaction performance 2) Steady contracts are able to handle massive documentsAs distributed storage systems are used to handle the storage and computing of massive files, high level algorithm is required. Every transaction stored on the chain will affect the chain performance detrimentally. Therefore, DxChain adopted the lightning network storage protocol which allows two parties to complete the transaction offline without affecting the chain.DxChain is more focusing on the underlying architecture of the blockchain storage technology, the design of service performance is relatively complete for business-oriented and customer-oriented. At the same time, the storage infrastructure platform is also under construction, such as AWS-compatible APIs, private clouds, and so on.In general, from the perspective of industry and technology development, if everything goes smoothly, DxChain would be a dark horse in the blockchain world.check full blog here: https://blog.dxchain.com/who-is-the-winner-among-billions-of-blockchain-infrastructure/Dxchain project update no. 35https://blog.dxchain.com/dxchain-project-updates-no-35-09-21-10-04/";For any business to grow effectively and be superior to others, it must incorporate technology.

If you are interested, you should try to complete their Master degree even though it might mean you will have to take some software engineering courses. (But they, this is a CS degree, not a data science degree, that's why.)  Also the Big Data courses don't teach you the necessary prerequisites (probability and statistics, algorithms, linear algebra, python programming etc...) so you must go in knowing it already.   If you don't pass the class with a B, you lose the $1500 for each course.#It only makes sense if you want to use it as a beginning of their Masters' program.  If you take 3 courses, get the certificate, you are 30% done with a Masters in CS.  So, if you want a trial run in a Masters of CS, and want the Big Data cert for your current job right away, then it makes sense.But I wouldn't enroll if your only goal is to switch careers to Big Data - then it's probably not worth it.
learnprogramming;d5dgdn;1568704448.0;/r/learnprogramming/comments/d5dgdn/apple_internship_qualifications/;Apple internship qualifications;I've  been applying to a lot of internships lately and I'm feeling pretty  decent about my chances to get something based on my current experience  and skill levels. That being said, I'm still pretty scared by Apple's  qualifications. I've applied to places like LinkedIn, Amazon, Microsoft,  and a few other pretty big places, but none of them seemed to exactly  have qualifications like what Apple does. I know it won't hurt  necessarily to apply and stuff and if I do get the position I do feel  confident that I can be productive and learn whatever I need to. Still,  I'm kinda feeling the vibes that I shouldn't even apply, although maybe  it's just a bit of imposter syndrome.I  think the most scary thing to me is just that they seem to ask for  expertise in everything from web related stuff to hardware to networks  and to mobile development. I'm hoping to apply for mainly the software  engineering and hope to work on some backend stuff or work on research. I  do feel good about my software engineering skills, my math skills,  machine learning, and the relevant stuff. That being said, I have no  experience with any of the javascript web frameworks since I (for some  reason) have developed a hatred for web development so far. I have some  big data skills from what I learned from machine learning, but nothing  focused on that. I know about OS, about memory, about some physical  hardware stuff, but it's just what I know from one of the required  classes I had to take at my university and again nothing focused on  that. They also ask for experience with client server protocols and such  which I do have, but again, nothing recent and big.Like  I mentioned above, I'm pretty sure that if I get the position I can  pick up enough about the other parts to be able to work efficiently on  the stuff that I really focus on, but it's still pretty scary to me. If I  get an interview question about big data stuff, I'll probably not be  super quick at answering it. If I get a question about mobile  development, I'll probably not be able to answer it. If I get a question  about web development, I'm pretty sure I just won't be able to answer  it at all unless it has to do with communication. Any thoughts and any  ideas on maybe how I can fill in gaps? Thanks!;Literally every company in IT has requirements for their open positions that are rediculous. I think I met 2/10 of them when I applied to the company I am working at. Write a proper resume and motivational letter together with a great portfolio. What you show and how you act at your interview will mean 1000x more than what is written on that sheet of paper you send in.

r4rSydneyXXX;d9k11i;1569506444.0;/r/r4rSydneyXXX/comments/d9k11i/22m_sub_seeking_a_dominant_girlfriend/;22M sub seeking a dominant girlfriend; Hello!  I'm a submissive Asian (more specifically Chinese) guy from Sydney [Australia](https://www.locanto.com.au/). I've been interested in the whole femdom area/topic for about 3-4 years now and would love to commit to a FLR, preferably in person, or otherwise an online arrangement can work also. A bit about me:  I'm currently 21, almost 22 years old. In terms of my kinks, I'm interested in chastity, orgasm denial, teasing, edging, strapon-anal (receiving), bondage, cunnilingus being the main ones with some others along the side. My limits include findom, scat, blood.  Within an FLR relationship, I think the ideal theme is to allow the girlfriend/wife feel COMFORTABLE and of course empowered. The last thing I would want is to make my domme feel pressured to maintain a dominant composure without enjoying it. As a couple, during the early stages we can learn about each other's limits, expectations and adjust accordingly to have a consensual exchange of power that allows you to feel like a princess/queen, while I learn more about the main, and even smaller things I can do in our relationship to satisfy your desires and meet the expectations that you have bestowed upon me.  An idea of me outside of the kink/femdom domain:  For work I'm a technical consultant, specialising within the Azure cloud space. I work for a company that is a Microsoft Partner I'm loving my job after understanding the expansive capabilities that can be offered by cloud solutions :D In the future I aspire to fulfill the role of a principal consultant within the cloud space, or other domains that have massive technological influence (namely big data, AI and Machine Learning).  I would consider myself fairly ambitious, sporty and outgoing. In terms of sports and exercise, my favourite at the moment is long distance running (planning on running the Marathon in the Sydney Running Festival), swimming and weights. Completing a 100km super marathon and an Ironman Triathlon are two major fitness related bucket list goals that I'm working hard on achieving right now. Outside of sports, I like to read, listen to music (primarily Asian music, chillstep etc.). When hanging out with friends I like eating out, going to karaoke, picnics, hiking and so forth.  I'm not the kind of person who indulges in alcohol drinking much at all, primarily for health reasons and also to the fact that I can't handle my alcohol for shit, so hope that's not an issue to you :p  In terms of what I'm looking for in a domme:  I'm expecting a slow, gentle and easy start into the femdom aspect within the relationship. This will give us time to really understand each other on a deeper level. It will also allow me time to adjust into the sub that fits with your expectations.  Therefore, I'm totally ok with a domme/mistress figure who's inexperienced or simply just curious to test things out. I'd much prefer that than a full on hardcore domination experience right from the start.  Honesty is also highly valued. If there are certain things within the femdom scene that you find uncomfortable, or want to try out, I expect you to speak up, and you should expect me to listen so we can have a proper discussion together on the expectations and limits.  The femdom aspects also needn't only exist within the sex scene. The idea is to make you feel comfortable as the leader within the relationship!  In terms of age preference, 18-30 would be ideal. I'd prefer to be with someone of similar age as me. It would also be good if you have similar interests as me so we have other things to talk and do together outside of purely the femdom aspect alone. Being Asian would also be a plus :)  If this is something that interests you, or you simply want to discuss together in a bit more detail before considering it (those new to femdom, or don't know what it is exactly), feel free to message me so we can discuss it in more detail :D  PS. I'd be willing to exchange pictures of Snapchat during the early stages of communication before connecting through other social medium platforms.;

For a University project on Big Data I would like to try and conduct an analysis on the evolution of privacy settings by users and correlate it with major scandals uncovered by the media regarding data breaches or data misuse. My idea was to try and correlate facebook data on privacy settings and scandals like Cambridge Analytica as well as with a sentiment analysis on twitter regarding certain keywords, such as privacy etc.. The goal would be to understand if people voice their discontent/call for action more when such scandals come to light but also if people actually do something about it by changing their personal privacy settings. However, it seems to be impossible to get a hold of such data sets from facebook.. I'm wondering if there are any open databases with such information on data privacy settings for other internet tools (such as browsers) and if so how to get them? Also for a sentiment analysis on twitter, do you have any advice on how to do it? Where to get the data? Thank you so much;

I’m choosing my modules and I’m interested in both, Data Science(Within the module - Statistics+ a littlle ML) and Cyber Security(+ to learn Computer Network) . They are in the same year category of choosing ‘optional modules’.  I do not know Computer networking as its not compulsory last year and this year of uni) and is ( of course) compulsory if i wanted to choose Cyber SecurityI am equally interested in both sectors. However, which is the better one to learn at University. Meaning, which sector is more intensive(aka hard), as i’d like to learn that sector during my university then self teach my self on the other.I would probably end up doing a masters in computer science however, itll be towards Big Data and AIData Science (Statistics + a little ML) or CyberSecurity(+Computer Networks) Thank you, in advance;Take this with a grain of salt since this is my opinion, but I would prefer data science over cyber security. Main reasoning is that you won't learn anything substantial enough with 1-2 semesters of cyber security to make a career out of. You would need to get certifications and extra credentials (ex: higher education) to make a career out of it. On the opposite end, data science you learn in 1-2 semesters is still going to be useful.I personally believe Computer Networks is a good class to take since it exposes you to a lot of introductory concepts and helps you gain a working knowledge - even if you aren't going to be actively developing in that field. In your day-to-day job activities, even if you aren't directly developing for networks it's still good knowledge to have.

You might be better off trying zram first, or pooling this $20 towards getting more RAM chips into your computer.Some calculations indicate that 120 GB drives can be destroyed in fairly short time. The simple calculation is: if we assume the SSD is based on some TLC technology, it might allow something like 1000 overwrites before breaking, so you maybe you could write 120 TB in total before breaking the drive. If you can write, say, 500 MB per second on the drive, you have 2 seconds per GB or 120 \* 2 \* 1000 seconds of continuous write lifetime. Perhaps it is plenty for you and swapping, but it's like 3 days of writing.Perhaps the SSD in question tolerates more overwrites, or perhaps you only end up writing less than 10 GB per day, or perhaps memory you want to swap is highly compressible and this reduces the total amount of writing you want to do. It could last a year, easily. Or you could put it into a grinder where it's dead in a month. Both outcomes are conceivable."

Entrepreneur;d6fccv;1568905583.0;/r/Entrepreneur/comments/d6fccv/analytics_without_numbers_viewing_products/;Analytics without numbers: Viewing products through users’ eyes; Here are two things you’ll hear a lot from product teams:1. A lot of data is needed to reduce uncertainty and get an accurate picture of users’ needs and behavior.2. People working on products understand and know their users well.The above statements are misconceptions, and in both cases, the reverse is true. In this post, I will discuss how analyzing user behavior without big data (debunking the first premise) will help us avoid the unpleasant outcomes of thinking you already know your users (debunking the second premise).## First misconception: We need a lot of data to reduce total uncertaintyImagine an infinite sized pool of black and white balls. Your task is to find out the share of white balls. Initially, you are in a state of complete uncertainty. How much data do you need to find the answer to this question?If you take 100 random balls and calculate the proportion of white balls, then you will know the answer with an accuracy of ± 9.8%. If you add another 100 balls, you will increase the accuracy of your answer to ± 6.9%  Add 200 more balls—you are up to ± 4.9%. Another 600 balls—up to ± 3.1%. With 9,000 more balls, you will achieve ± 1% accuracy.Did you notice that the first 100 balls gave us a lot more knowledge than the next 100, and going from 100 to 200 balls had much more impact on the accuracy than the 1,000-10,000 range?Let’s keep this in mind and move on to the second misconception.## Second misconception: People working on products understand and know their users wellThe second misconception assumes we understand the products we are working on.The truth is, we don’t.We are always looking for ways to close the gap between the product model we envision and the actual product we build. To do so, we try out new tools and approaches, communicate with users, conduct experiments and analyze data.The goal behind all of these activities is simple. We want to improve our understanding of the product and users, to find opportunities for growth and development, and to increase the proportion of the right decisions we make.## Viewing the product through users’ eyesWhat was this long introduction about? I want to introduce you to a method that will allow you to learn a lot about your product. It is very simple:*Take a few users and observe how they use your product.*No, you don’t have to conduct an interview with these users. There’s also no need to calculate the metrics that characterize their behavior in the product. We literally need to take a specific user and monitor how she interacts with the product throughout her entire period of usage.How can you do it? If you already have event logging set right in the product, it is very simple:1. Select the group of users you want to study (you will need different users to get answers to different questions).2. For each user of this group, create a sequence of all the events they generate, including the event parameters, from the time they start using the product.3. You will end up with a sequence of events for each user in your product. You can divide this sequence into separate sessions for convenience.You can also do it with the help of Amplitude’s User Look-Up tool.Now you have everything you need to view the product through the user’s eyes. Look at the sequence of events and start analyzing it. Take notes along the way.You will observe what the user does while going through the onboarding and afterward, what difficulties she encounters along the way, at what point her first session ends, whether she has experienced the product’s value by that time, when does she retain and how long it takes her to do so, and much more.Now, let’s go back to the first misconception. Studying a small number of users (50-100) with this method will help you find out the following:1. How and why do people use your product?2. What problems do they face at different stages in your product?3. How does the actual usage differ from what you designed the product for4. Which users tend to stay and which tend to leave? What are the differences between them?Another benefit of doing this type of analysis is that it helps you come up with a bunch of hypotheses that you can test/validate through data analysis, experiments or user research.## Case studies of analyzing user behavior through session analysisThe method we described above solves a wide range of tasks, so it can be considered quite universal. Here are a few cases where session analysis proved to be very useful.## Yandex Maps RedesignRedesigning any old popular service is extremely risky. It’s very important not to break any of the existing use cases in the new design.A few years ago, I worked on the redesign of the web version of [Yandex Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.yandex.yandexmaps&hl=en), the most popular online map service in Russia and CIS market with over 30 million users. Due to the complexity and scale of the task, we wanted to make sure we understood thoroughly all the use cases our users have. To do that we decided to manually analyze user sessions.We selected a few hundred random users, manually examined their sessions, categorized them, and wrote down our observations. The result was a table of existing product use cases and their popularity.You might argue that this approach was not necessary, that we could have just calculated the share of people who used the product to build routes, those who checked the traffic jams, or searched for organizations, etc. But these quantitative indicators would have hidden a lot of useful and critical information about the way people solve their problems with the product.It turned out, for example, that different people used the same features and solved similar tasks in completely different ways. And it was something we should have considered in the new version of the product.In the process, we made a number of unexpected discoveries. For example, it seemed obvious to us that in the task “to find an organization on a map -> find out how to get there,” users build a route directly from the organization’s snippet (see the orange arrow in the screenshot).In reality, however, it turned out that only a small percent of users did this. Most users simply copied the address of the organization and pasted it in the routes tab to build a new route (see the green arrow on the screenshot).I don’t know any other way to learn about such unexpected twists in users’ behavior other than tracking their events and examining their sessions. And the fact that such behavior exists entails many questions. Creating routes directly from the organization’s snippet is clearly easier than copy-pasting its address in the route tab. Why are users missing it? Is the organization’s featured snippet overloaded with data? Are users not noticing the button?## Finding problems in the first versions of [King of Thieves](https://www.kingofthieves.com/)When creating products, we usually assume people are going to use them in the “correct” way. We design a product in a way that helps users discover its core value as soon as possible.Surprisingly, “silly” users always do everything in their own way instead of the way we anticipate. This is exactly what happened with the first versions of King of Thieves.King of Thieves is a mobile game in which you have to break into dungeons and steal treasures and gems. You can play the game in single-player mode, but the true value of the game is in its competitive multiplayer mode. The key feature of the game is to steal gems from other players to become the wealthiest thief. At the same time, players must defend their own treasures and build traps in order to stop rivals from stealing their treasures.King of Thieves turned out to be a very successful game—but the launch of its first version was a disaster.The game’s retention was a poor 26%. Most players left the game shortly after they tried it and never came back.To understand the reasons behind this, we looked at the user sessions in the way described above. We wanted to understand what was wrong.The core value of the game was in its multiplayer mode. When creating the game’s onboarding, we assumed that we would show how the game mechanics work in the first levels of the single-player campaign, and then players would switch to the multiplayer mode when they were ready. That’s exactly why we made a huge red multiplayer button after all!But it turned out that most users simply went through the single-player levels without ever paying attention to the multiplayer game mode. After some time, they got stuck in a difficult level, or just got bored, and abandoned the game.There were few who switched to multiplayer, but in most cases the players saw no difference from the single-player mode. The opponent either had no gems to steal, or he did, but when players completed the level, they weren’t awarded the gem, even though stealing gems from other players was part of the game’s core loop.After analyzing the sessions of several hundred users (the sessions were very short, so it didn’t take us too long), we figured out that less than 10% of users had a chance to experience the essence of the game in their first few sessions. Those who grasped it were much more likely to keep playing the game.Of course, we should not forget that at that point, this was just a correlation—it did not necessarily mean that players kept playing the game because of that experience. Nonetheless, it was a good starting point, and the hypothesis that walking more users through this experience will improve the metrics was worth testing.We could have probably found this problem through metrics alone: We would see that a very small percentage of new users try the multiplayer mode. And in most cases, those who do try do not steal gems from their opponents. But we didn’t know exactly what we were looking for or when we needed to pay our attention. Perhaps everything was fine, and players simply didn’t find the mechanics of the game entertaining enough.We launched a new version of the game in which we walked players through the multiplayer mode in the onboarding and also made sure that when players attack a dungeon, there’s a gem for them to retrieve and they actually get it after completing the level. As a result, the game metrics significantly improved: Day 1 retention soared from 26% to 41%, while Day 7 retention increased from 9% to a healthier 20%.While examining the sessions and looking at the product through the eyes of our users, we found the stark contradiction between what players experienced and what we wanted them to actually experience.## Optimizing the Funnel of adding a flight in [App in the Air](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/app-in-air-best-flight-tracker/id527299553)Here is a wonderful example that Bayram Annakov shared in his [blog](https://medium.com/@bayramannakov/funnel-analysis-investigating-why-users-drop-6cccbbe41968#.d6c2vl77l).App in the Air is a mobile app that keeps track of your itineraries, boarding passes, and frequent-flier programs. The application helps ease the frustration and complexities of finding and managing flights.However, the product team found that 30% of users of the App in the Air didn’t add a flight after opening the app screen where they were expected to do that.The problem turned out to be pretty trivial, as has been the case in many similar problems. The users would search for the name of the airline or airport they sought in their native language—the search worked only in English.The funnel demonstrated that 30% of users churn at a certain step, but in order to find out why, it was necessary to go one level deeper and look at what exactly people were doing at that step.After making sure all the app’s localized languages were considered, the churn rate at this funnel step declined from 30% to 5%.## Personal sales firstY Combinator co-founder Paul Graham has an iconic essay titled “[Do things that don’t scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html).” One of the things Graham mentions is that founders should personally find their first customers and help them onboard into their product, serving as a tutorial manual in a way.Why? Because it gives the opportunity to look at your product through users’ eyes, which in turn allows you to quickly find points your users don’t understand, where they find the maximum value, and what is and isn’t important to them.It is true that this can be labor intensive and not fun at all. It is way easier and less stressful to look at a drop in the funnel at a specific step than to seek and observe lack of understanding in real people to whom you’ve recently spoken about all the advantages of your service.Personal sales work great for B2B products. In fact, session analysis is a variation of this approach that is more suitable for B2C products (though it can also work for B2B). Now you can select the users you need and study them in detail, like in the previous example with App in the Air, where users reached the screen where they could add a flight, but for some reason didn’t complete the step.Moreover, you can also contact these users personally later and ask them the questions you have in mind. This will make the overall picture as complete as possible.## Pros and cons of analyzing user sessions manuallyAnalyzing user sessions will give you a more decent understanding of how people are using your product. This is not an abstract knowledge of how various popular features and conversion of various funnel steps work, but a vivid idea about your users’ paths within the product from the moment they start using it until they either churn or your service becomes a part of their life.Another bonus of such an analysis is making it easier for you to work on new things in the product. Having a clear picture of the current paths of your users inside the service, you can better predict how and at what stage the planned changes will affect them. This increases your chances of making the right decision.Unlike using metrics, this method loses much less information along the way. But, as is usually the case, it also has its disadvantages. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to compare different versions of the product based on the manual session analysis method. You will have to analyze too many of them to obtain statistically significant results. In this case, metrics, cohort analysis, and A/B tests will help you.## Summing it upMany think that analytics is all about numbers and mathematics. In my opinion, analytics should help you to understand your product and answer questions you have about it. Numbers and metrics can help with this and solve some problems rather well, but you should not limit yourself to them. For some tasks, other approaches, including manual session analysis, will do a much better job.Try examining the session of 50 users of your product.
