privacy;hvkgxu;1595381497.0;/r/privacy/comments/hvkgxu/for_privacy_newbies_understand_your_threat_model/;For privacy newbies - understand your threat model first.;[removed];"Removed:>Please don’t fuel conspiracy thinking here. Don’t try to spread FUD, especially against reliable privacy-enhancing software. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Show credible sources.#Most of these are about anonymity rather than privacy. Very cool post nonetheless#I find it hard to take this post seriously when you say that Firefox is a  copycat of Chrome. What the fuck are you on about? You do realise Tails uses Firefox, right?#Please explain how Firefox is an issue...?#[deleted]#No Firefox? Even with all the security Add-ons? Why?Not trying to argue, I actually don't know why? O thought it was pretty secure with the add-ons. BTW Excellent post.#A good post OP. I slightly disagree.For newbies I’d suggest keeping an modest on line identity for convenience e.g. a gmail account and a few Google apps or similar on Apple. Much convenience and little risk. Even gmail is OK for work colleagues etc. A smart phone or iPad is very useful and it can be left at home, turned off, separated from iCloud etc on occasion.What info to share or store: anything that you would be happy to see on the front page of the daily newspaper with your photo and name.Add a separate identity with separate secure emails, messaging, non-smart devices. Less convenience but more privacy, possible some anonymity.A password manager with separate folders or vaults is required as it allows you to manufacture and maintain your two electronic identities. Transition of many logins, passwords, data to a more secure environment can then be a logical and fairly painless process.Edit: suggestions for a newbie with a low risk threat assessment.#Privacytools.io is the best resource.The best setup for neebies is firefox set as a private page with ublock origin,cookie autodelete,privacybadger,decentraleyes,https everywhere. Using a password manager and multiple emails for multiple things.Get rid of google products,use duckduckgo or other privacy oriented search engine from tge site above.Use open source software, decentralised software and encrypted chats like signal (which is the best imho).Other more advanced things are changing your dns,routing your system apps and browser through tor,using wired connections as much as you can,using a linux distro,using custom roms,using burner phones,using containers etc.#Yes let's use XMPP rather than WhatsApp and install a browser that is not Firefox or Chromium. Dude...#In your bulleted list, I'd really recommend being more objective with why people should perform those actions.In other words, what information is leaked?  What's the specific threat that is being mitigated?#Anyone interested in learning should visit r/opsec as well.#Title says ""first create a threat model"", then body of post says almost nothing about how to do that, most of it is about best practices and tools.""Create a threat model"" is nonsense for ordinary people.  They have no specific threats, no specific info with which to create a ""model"".  And supposed online experts who have tried to help me (an ordinary person) create a threat model have come up empty.Instead, ordinary people should be encouraged to learn and use best practices, until they reach a level of high cost / low benefit where they decide to stop.  Maybe judging ""benefit"" is a form of evaluating validity of threats.  But telling them to create a ""threat model"" in a vacuum is nonsense.[Also, just about every comment under this post is talking about practices/tools, not threat model.]#In india you can't get a sim card without giving national identity card which by the way has your finger prints ( bio identity data), not to mention many companies like xiomi ( offers cheap hardware at the cost of worst possible adware os ) , asks your imei code to be sent to their servers before you unlock the bootloader,hence you must give them imei numbers , it will be stored on chinese numbers.This trick might soon be followed by a lot more companies, things look bleak here#>don't use Chrome or its derivatives and copycats (including Firefox) Why are you implying that Firefox is a derivative or copycat of Chrome?Why are you saying that a browser like Chromium or Firefox is a problem?Both of those assertions are wrong. The latter one could sort of be not wrong if you're like Edward Snowden or something, that that's a pretty crazy level. What browser would you even suggest? Tor? it's just Firefox with some extra stuff.#You can save locally to a Tails USB by creating a persistent encrypted partition. They have an incredibly easily GUI for it too.#not to mention all those websites that require you to use recaptcha whenever you turn your VPN on ""/#Many apps require google play services. I recently installed lineage os, and removed all the google stuff from my phone, but now I can't make any payment using my phone as all the payment apps require google play services.Any tips on this?#Good post man some excellent points. I really appreciate you mentioning trade off at the end as it's something that people leave out a lot.#Finally somebody talking about threat models... thanks for this post#IMO, people who say claim that they have nothing to hide should be made to realize that even in the best case scenario, they have nothing to hide **from the people they trust**. They might not hesitate handing over their passwords to their partner, but it's a whole different ballgame when it's a stranger.#This post is lame.#What are ppl supposed to do who earn on sites like upwork?#I think no Netflix and no phone GPS is kind of a deal breaker for most people though.#[deleted]#>Use an adblocker on your device and don't use Chrome or its derivatives and copycats (including Firefox)I would argue for people to do instead more research about the browser they use.   ~~For example, Brave is a chrome derivative but they seem pretty dedicated to privacy.~~  Well shit, apparently I haven't been keeping up with the Brave browser privacy news.    And they were doing so well before too.#[deleted]#So how am I supposed to even know what was removed here?#In an extreme case there is little difference. Isn't there?#I meant privacy newbies in the context of r/privacy, but yeah.#Doesn't just dismiss firefox as a 'copycat' of chrome, but **then goes on to recommend pale moon, a firefox fork**.#I've used Firefox for 18 years and watched it go into a full blown fucking polished turd by dumping features that made it unique and copying Chrome since about 2011 - be it a dumbed down user interface designed for mobile and touchscreens only, or memory hogging multiprocess. If you haven't used Firefox circa 2002-08 there's no way you'll understand this. See [this reply](https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/hvkgxu/for_privacy_newbies_understand_your_threat_model/fyu5so2/).#https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/hvkgxu/for_privacy_newbies_understand_your_threat_model/fyu5so2/#I wouldn't consider Firefox either a derivative or a copycat of Firefox, so I'm also confused at this. The only possible privacy gripes I can think of can be disabled in the settings: its search engine defaults to Google in many countries, and it collects crash reports by default. Firefox is open source software and generally takes privacy seriously, including its own tracking protection in private browsing mode.Either way, it should not be lumped together with Chrome.#[deleted]#This is a great list to get started. My post was to address the confusion between general privacy measures one can take and having to deal with full blown surveillance, and many newbie posts here seem to assume that the former implies the latter.That is why I provided a list of suggestions as a sliding scale from barest minimum to full blown paranoia. People have to individually assess where they stand and and what tradeoff is acceptable for them. But your list is an excellent starting point.#Note that your whole comment has **nothing** to do with threat modeling, which is the title of the post.#Firefox has an addon called Multi-Account container, which lets you set something like facebook or reddit to always open in their own container, preventing them from reading cookies and things from other containers.#Session is better than signal.   Signal uses phone number to login which has been proven to be hijack-able. Session is a Signal fork that does not use phone numbers for registrating. Randomly generated usernames only.#I am making the case that for the vast majority of people, blocking ads and trackers combined with being careful of what they post on social media is more than enough since they aren't Jason Bourne or Edward Snowden for more sinister actors to take unusual interest in them. I addressed the benefit of doing this before the bulleted list.#There you will find lots of people yelling at you to first **make** a threat model, but no one actually able to tell an ordinary person (who has no specific threats) **how** to do it.  I think threat-modeling is nonsense for ordinary people, who have no specific threats.  That kind of person should focus on best practices instead of making a threat model.#>Title says ""first create a threat model""Understand, not create. If you can't read a title properly, then well..> They have no specific threats, no specific info with which to create a ""model"". And yet the first thing they do when they land up here (this post was specifically in response to newcomers posting here, not any general case) is full blown alarmism and paranoia. To put it concisely if bluntly: if one is not a political activist or journalist or accessing the internet from a censorship happy regime like China or Russia, then one should stop with the 'Is the FBI/Google/Facebook after my online activities' bullshit and stick to the basics which I've already mentioned with regard to blocking ads/trackers & prudence on social media.#Yes, which is why all the guides to get a virtual number or a burner SIM are no way universal. Many other countries have these restrictions as well.#If you are talking about Aadhaar, you can get a SIM without it. You do need something like a driving license though (which in many states is not linked to biometrics). You are actively encouraged to provide Adhaar, but it is not mandatory (yet).Jio I believe did mandate Aadhaar - not sure whether they still do.#>Why are you implying that Firefox is a derivative or copycat of Chrome?If you have been using Firefox since 2002 like I have, you'll see why. I've posted links in a repy to another comment here that date to when this shit started, and go into great detail. If the first browser you ever used was Chrome then your expectations are already ruined and you'll think contemporary Firefox is amazing by comparison.#Oh, wasn't aware. Then again, you can still be forced to decrypt it in certain situations (goes back to threat model).#Cloudflare especially. Royal pain in the butt. They assume you're a bot or something.#No way unless there's a functioning mobile website also offered in addition to the app. Amazon does, for example. You can of course get [opengapps](https://opengapps.org/) and flash it separately to restore a minimal set of Google components for just the play store functionality (and not have the full bloat of Gmail and other apps).#thanks :)#Thank you so much for your utterly insightful and valuable feedback. Not.#Again - a sliding scale based on how much you can learn and set up or how much of an inconvenience you find it. I assume upwork lets you bid for contracted work that you can then do?* Basic level - keep one browser only for Upwork related stuff, this can be Chrome if you don't care. Use Pale Moon or Firefox or anything else for your regular browsing.Or if you have 2 separate computers then use one only for work and the other only for personal stuff. * Advanced level - If you have enough RAM (more than 8 GB), install a virtual machine and use that only for work related stuff.#use a virtual machine instance?#Yes, hence I said there is no one size fits all, and most people don't need that kind of paranoia about being snooped on either. The extreme measures are for those who truly face extreme threats, and they most definitely are not the average internet user.#>You can avoid using Google services in default OS, too.No you can't. It's not a matter of 'avoid using their services', their Android components are designed to constantly track your activity and sensor information as well as provide that to apps that request it. And that will still expose you to their fucking advertising. Can't imagine kids today being so accustomed to having ads shoved in front of their faces no matter what, in addition to creepily tracking you and showing you ads based on stuff you just spoke about or searched online.#Can you share what you found out about Brave ? I use it when some Websites for work are only compatible with Chrome#Brave is bs#What's bad about Brave?#Leaving all your other points aside, since when is Fedora a beginner-friendly distro? Shouldn't that be Linux Mint or Ubuntu?#Your post was removed. In new Reddit there should be a visible warning. In old Reddit, I'm not sure how it is displayed to the user.#The point is that the extreme case applies to a very small set of people, mostly those who have pissed off powerful entities like governments or megacorporations, yet the majority of newcomers to this sub seem to think that they are facing similar threats.#Not my fault you don't even know what a fork means. Firefox itself is forked from the navigator component of [Mozilla Application Suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Application_Suite) circa 2001, doesn't mean they're both one and the same now.#what has the interface to do with privacy and security?#I’ve used it the old days. The world goes forward, some of these features were used only by a tiny fraction of users. Some of these features are still here, just hidden. Multiprocess improved speed and stability of the browser. Yes, I remember the old days. With addons you’d have every separate program built into your browser. In a single process. And all the tabs. Oh, and the plugins. I remember how over time the stability of the whole thing was getting worse and worse. I remember how the browser stopped crashing like crazy when they split plugins into separate processes, so only those would crash, leaving the browser running, with an info that the plugin on the page has stopped working.I don’t event want to mention the security implications of running everything in one process, with insecure Flash programs from random sites running inside...I don’t agree with all of Mozilla’s decisions. But the world goes forward, and without their decisions and work, with some unfortunate tradeoffs, this browser would already be long dead and forgotten.Also, what are your other options? You’re gonna use chrome’s fork with google stuff removed (and perhaps other shit added)? How is that better or less of a chrome copycat? Oh, it’s not a copycat if it’s chrome itself. What else? Internet Explorer on Trident? Opera on its old engine? These experimental browsers that barely render HTML structure? Lynx? Maybe bare cURL?#Exactly. I don't think there's a reason to say Firefox is the same as Chrome. I mean Firefox at least allows you to turn those analytics off. And Firefox has much better privacy than that of Chrome. Sure, it does put Google as the default search engine but that's just because Google has the most users so it is in a way tolerable since at least Firefox doesn't give problems if you don't use Google xD unlike Chrome. Long ago I set DuckDuckGo on my Chrome browser and I never knew DuckDuckGo could give problems but then after a little bit of searching I found that Chrome apparently does some nasty stuff if you don't use Google.#You put it well. Thank you#[deleted]#How does it makes you less secure? In which way? Aren't them at least alerting you of threats?#Can you elaborate?#In a recent signal AMA they said that the phone number feature will soon be changed.#Since you brought it up, I’d say your opinion of that subreddit is a bit biased to your own negative experiences, rightfully deserved.You continue to ignore basic instructions while contradicting yourself and claiming “threat modeling isn’t useful”.Even in this comment you claim it isn’t useful if someone has “no specific threats”. Well, how would someone know they have “no specific threats” unless they’ve already threat modeled? As the community continues to tell you (and you continue to willfully ignore), it is the process that is important, even if the outcome may be similar for many people. You don’t skip the process just because you think it might be similar outcome, at least not if you actually care about safety, privacy, survival, etc.As for best practices, only the most elementary of best practices apply to most. Beyond that, “best practices” for one person may be illegal for another, or introduce new or skip over existing attack surfaces you didn’t consider (because you didn’t first attempt to understand their situation).Opsec is about a mindset— anti-silver bullet, anti-careless, pro-self-learning. “Read this guide and you’ll be safe” can never be a serious solution to privacy and security any more than a “do these specific workouts to be healthy” guide can be applied to all people in varying health conditions, completely ignoring their own physiology and diet.#All you can do is quibble about a word.  You have no info about how to create/understand a threat model, no justification for why an ordinary person should have one, you go back to talking about ""basics"" of tools and practices, not threat modeling.#I’ve been using Netscape / Mozilla / Firefox since 1995 and this whole post is a bad intro for newbies and a turnoff to this subreddit.#what has privacy got anything to do with a company copying another’s browser features#I've been using FF since way before Chrome, and never liked Chrome (and hence never really used it). I still don't know why you're saying what you're saying, so you're wrong.#i dont need to add anything to this as youve nailed it, but did remind me of what ill call the ""wrench rule"": your password is only as secure as you're able to keep your mouth shut when someone's beating you in the knees with a wrench.actually kinda illuminates good theory about security tho imo#No problem, have a nice day.#Sounds good!#[deleted]#Tl dr: They were redirecting users who entered binance (a crypto exchange service) to  binance link with an affiliate link so that Brave will earn money by ""recommending"" binance to you.    This type of redirection is something you'll see all the time on reviews or deal posts but the fact that Brave does it without informing the user is shady af if not straight up illegal.Details here:  [https://www.pcmag.com/news/brave-browser-caught-redirecting-users-through-affiliate-links](https://www.pcmag.com/news/brave-browser-caught-redirecting-users-through-affiliate-links)&#x200B I'm kinda torn on the findings.   On one hand, the fact that the redirect was caught and addressed immediately means that the system is working with privacy problems being identified by the users and addressed immediately by Brave.   On the other hand, the fact that Brave was willing to redirect  URLs without the user's knowledge really makes you wonder: what other stuff would they be willing to do in order to make money?  For me, this action represents them stepping one foot on a very slippery slope.   Hopefully, they don't try to pull this stuff again but who knows?#Care to explain? I use Firefox myself but the only real bad thing I've heard of brave is that they injected affiliate links, like not having a choice to turn that off isn't good at all, but that shouldn't ruin the reputation of a browser.#Which post? This entire thread? https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/hvkgxu/for_privacy_newbies_understand_your_threat_model/What happened, some asshole from Mozilla wanted to shut it down because they couldn't take the criticism and truth bombs supported by evidence from their own servers at the links I shared?#l33t powah usah interface has to be clunky and obtuse, because catering to a larger audience necessitates compromising on privacy and security, duh /s#What nasty stuff does Chrome do if you don't use Google search?  I started using DuckDuckGo a couple months ago and don't see any problems.#I wouldn’t say Firefox is bad either but in terms of privacy and online anonymity it isn’t the greatest at default. If you’re using a network filter you start to realize very quickly how often Firefox is establishing outgoing connections with Akamai technologies and AWS for various reasons, one being fingerprinting. It has to do with captive portal in about:config and can be changed but is enabled by default because it enables Firefox to automatically connect to internet access portals and the like. That said, the point that Firefox lies on the privacy to convenience spectrum is more than acceptable to most.#I need to know also. What is wrong with Firefox?#What's ghacks? Do you have a link?#[deleted]#[deleted]#I was unaware of this, until then I'll use Session instead.#I went to your sub and asked everyone/anyone to help me create a threat model.  You and several others tried and failed.> how would someone know they have “no specific threats” unless they’ve already threat modeled? So, just trying to think of threats constitutes ""creating a threat model"" ?  Seems bogus.  All the generic threats apply to me and 99% of people, so I guess we can write down one ""threat model"" including everything to a moderate level, and be done with it.#Then you're probably the kind whose VCR blinked 12:00 in the 90s, by leaving everything at its default and you never bothered to customize Firefox during its heyday, so all their changes over the years post Australis don't mean shit to you.#Because said browser has [a long history](https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/hvkgxu/for_privacy_newbies_understand_your_threat_model/fyu5so2/) of violating user privacy themselves and justifying it with 'you can always turn that off'. As anyone who's been using said browser since 2002 can attest, starting with this shit around 2011.#Using Firefox on vanilla settings doesn't count. Firefox used to be the browser for power users with its extensibility, and they in turn recommended it to their less nerdy family and friends. All the truly powerful and useful extensions broke overnight once they deprecated XUL, leaving us with the lame Web extension technology which is no different from what Chrome does. If you never bothered to use extensions before (beyond maybe adblock plus that everyone had), and had absolutely no problem with the moronic touchscreen focused changes to the UI they kept doing with every release since Australis then it's **you** that doesn't know what you're saying.#I assure you my memory would never be less clear if I was getting beaten. As it is I can't remember my own birthday#I think you mean [this](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png) :D#>If you fresh start an Android device and not log into a Google account, shut down Location services, set up Tor etc, your activities should not be tracked. There is no account to track, no permissions given to apps, no cookies to track either.Depends on how much you trust Google to respect those settings and not track you anyway. I haven't verified by checking network traffic on a fresh device without a logged in Google account, but speaking for myself, I would rather be in control of my device than depend on the promise of a company that made it. Also if you don't sign in to a Google account, you can't use Play Store anyway  - at that point your phone is as good as a custom ROM in term of being unable to use those features. >However, without a default OS, you could not use full-device hardware encryption and other secure solutions, e.g. Samsung Secure Folder.You can - I use a custom ROM with minimal Play Services **and** root apps that disable system components related to advertising and analytics, in addition to a firewall and hosts based adblocking. Besides Samsung is the last device I'd recommend to anyone looking to root or use custom ROMs anyway, their locked down bootloader and hardware based unlock detection isn't for me, someone who believes users should be in full control of the devices they paid good money for. >Thereby, I'd advise against rooting your phone as it means goodbye security.Only for idiots who install unknown or pirated apps from shady 3rd party appstores, and even then assuming said app knows that your phone is rooted. People who root tend not to be utter morons usually, and as a result malware authors cannot assume their apps will have root access always. Much easier to fool the average idiot into granting the app a full set of permissions to do as it pleases, no root access required.  I mean imagine reading my entire post and not understanding the core point that every security measure isn't meant for everyone and people have to understand that average folk aren't James Bond or Jason Bourne for the government to be spying on them and thus necessitating extreme measures that i listed.#Same. In fact, Brave is the first browser I suggest a non-techy relative to switch to since I can't go on hardening everyone's Firefox.As far as I am concerned, `Hardened Firefox > Brave > Firefox > ... > Chrome`#Yes, your entire post. If I had removed a comment, I would have replied to one of your comments.No, no contact with Mozilla. I've never had direct contact with anyone at Mozilla at any point in my life, outside of their tech support. So that's the level of contact I have with Mozilla: none.I just read your post and found that you made several claims about Firefox among others that you did not source. Your claim that Firefox is a copycat of Chrome for example was not supported by evidence and cannot be in any way regarded as a 'truth bomb'.#I don't think it does those things anymore. DuckDuckGo automatically used to become slower on Chrome. If you start it in two different browsers (Chrome and some other) then Chrome would load it slower and some other glitches like sometimes it'd say could not find server and those things. But it used to be like this like a year ago. I changed to Firefox and everything became more stable. You probably won't find these problems anymore.#Well ask op! Not me#[deleted]#[deleted]#To add to this, having a bunch of extensions even if they are privacy related allows canvas fingerprinting to identify you a lot more easily because there just aren’t many people out there using those specific extensions.#you just gotta install the mozilla recommended ones#[deleted]#Nah#The link you keep using leads to a non-existent comment#I never said that you don't know what you're saying. I'm saying that you're flat out wrong to say that those people know what you're talking about.The extension change was an annoyance, but there were justified reasons for it. As far as I know the main one is for better security and general operability.#yes right i forgot about this. someone else told me this and then referred to the comic but i forgot entirely. XKCD always gets it right#[deleted]#Stock Firefox is way better than brave#Thanks#The opposite is the case. If you cripple down browser stuff you don't understand, the browser end in misbehaviour.  Attack surface reduction needs to be done at browser level, not user side which never works.#Use an extension that randomizes enough canvas attributes th prevent it!#Ehh, it's not easy haha.   I've only managed to get a couple over. The rest are still on Whatsapp/Facebook. The 2 buddies followed me over from Signal though so they weren't hard to convince.#Strange. It was in response to /u/MrBarryAllen9, here - https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/hvkgxu/for_privacy_newbies_understand_your_threat_model/fyu44x5/#And that worked out so well, didn't it? Whether the utter fiasco of [disabling everyone's extensions due to an expired certificate](https://www.zdnet.com/article/firefox-add-ons-disabled-en-masse-after-mozilla-certificate-issue/), or [the rise in cross browser malicious extensions courtesy switching over to Chrome compatible Webextensions](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/01/mozilla-and-google-crack-down-on-malicious-and-abusive-browser-extensions/). This when there was barely any malware with the older extension technology to begin with. And of course it makes perfect sense to make your own product compatible with the competition, because it is really important for end users that an extension should work across all browsers.If anything, the crashed marketshare from a high of about 35% in 2009 should've shown them what copying Chrome feature for feature and removing what they originally had does. If people wanted to use Chrome, they don't need a browser trying hard to be it.#> But you can weigh that against how much you demand to control your device just for the sake of evading tracking and ads.I pretty much do, as someone using computers for the last 30 years. >but I tried raising concerns about the custom ROM as it being a secure measure is nothing but a myth.> Speaking of trusting Google, same question can be asked for the custom ROM creator.Completely open source and available for inspection if it's a well known one like LineageOS - unlike the proprietary blobs of your phone's firmware and Google's proprietary components. It is about customization of your own phone primarily, and full disk encryption is still possible.#well it is not there anymore, I even checked your comment history. it must have been deletedbtw if you say dont use firefox, what should I use?#>btw if you say dont use firefox, what should I use?[Pale Moon](http://palemoon.org/).Is it possible to delete a comment and still have it visible to the original poster?

But you're recommending a Firefox fork? Why is Chrome forks out of the question, in addition to Firefox, but Firefox forks is ok?#A fork is an independent branch of an open source software based on a snapshot of the original software at a point in time, after which it follows its own separate development path without being affected by changes to the original. Chrome based browsers aren't true forks because they internally depend on Blink, Google's browser engine. They are dependent on whatever changes Google introduces, if for example Google fully implements its [proposed manifest v3 restrictions](https://www.ghacks.net/2019/11/13/google-implements-controversial-manifest-v3-in-chrome-canary-80/) tomorrow that can impact adblocking extensions, it will affect every browser that uses the same codebase. Pale Moon was first forked from before Firefox 29, when they introduced the [lame Australis UI](https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/firefox-disable-australis.html) that has its own set of problems. The internal XUL platform code was again forked from Firefox 52, when it became clear that Mozilla was going to get rid of that platform altogether. Firefox's internal rendering engine is called [Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_%28software%29), and there [used to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Web_browsers_based_on_Firefox) plenty of Gecko based browsers in the past the way there are Blink based ones now. Pale Moon used to be based on Gecko like the rest till about 2016, but now runs on an independent fork of Gecko called [Goanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goanna_%28software%29), which is developed on its own path today. So Pale Moon has nothing in common with modern Firefox as it is today, and Chrome based browsers directly use Blink rather than independent forks of it.  What you're asking would be applicable to anyone who was creating a Firefox fork based on their code as it exists *today*, not from what it was earlier.#Thanks for the detailed reply. I really appreciate that. It all makes sense now.#You're welcome. It's crazy how many people dismiss Pale Moon for being a 'fork' with zero understanding of what the term means. A bit of history - Firefox itself is forked from the [Mozilla Application Suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Application_Suite) circa 2001. It would be ridiculous to say that they are both the same product now."

But Google turned around and sent Netlist packing and decided it was cheaper to steal and use the technology than to pay Netlist a proper setlement. Legally, that is called willful infringement  and the law says that the infringer will have to pay triple damages for their ill gained profit.&#x200B Google probably makes YEARLY 20B+ on these patents alone imagine **10 YEARS** , just let that sink in.&#x200B Now the case has been taken by a unanimous by all of the three judges (This is Important) and they decided that the 912 patent is rightfully from Net List . so that means they have a hot patent in a 300B+ sector so you tell me.912 patent: ( Netlist believes that the teachings of the '912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry.)&#x200B # so you may be asking yourselves, WTF does this all mean and what are the possibles outcomes.don""t worry i gotcha covered.  (in order of most probable)&#x200B REMEMBER ITS FOR THE **15 OF JULY. that's the dead line.**&#x200B 1. Google does a buy out of the company in which case the stocks skyrockets to no tomorrow and we will have weekly lambos. price targets conservative should be 5+ and even 25 is not fiction. this is the most likely scenario because it wouldn't hinder the company at all and would be a drop in the bucket for them. Not to mention that this is the perfect opportunity for them to craft their components in house especially since apple made that move recently.&#x200B 2. Google will try to extend the ruling and take this case to the supreme court but there are two outcomes here.&#x200B A. google most likely will get denied because the court ruling of the 912 patent was unanimous and getting a appeal for the supreme court will be unlikely even for Google we are talking like 10% or less in which case means Lambo full of tendies for us.&#x200B B. Worst case but the least likely Scenario Google uses the ! trillion market cap to make the supreme court bend and take a look on the case but we still have very good odds to win because its clear now that they did steal that tech and we will have to bag hold it until it inevitably sky rockets.&#x200B 3. google will try to pull a hostile takeover on the company in which case our stock sky rockets to oblivion and then some.&#x200B now some interesting info :Google has [closed](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-reportedly-cancelled-cloud-project-042508821.html) a cloud project meant for countries including China. so possibly they've known this for awhile now and they are taking the necessary preparations so that share holders don't get so upset.sadly i've seen that NLST isn't available on RH so sorry guys.Today the stock has been shorted from .80 to .67 but this is most likely the shorters and that won't be a huge problem for us especially on possible outcome i personally own.  hopefully this stock crosses the $1.00 dollar mark next week and after the settlement is issued it can reach $15.00+&#x200B it also has been rising consistently the past few weeks 8% to 10% today being the exception but its because the markets.&#x200B the company has a tendency to increase its float but for this case this will definitely won't matter at all.now whats the beauty of this stock even if google doesn't pay up for some bullshit reason which it literally can't happen, you have a company stock that has a patent and various others ones, a patent that is used on almost every single electronic device on the planet.be patient guys this can actually be a fucking investment for once in your career as a penny trader.&#x200B Disclaimer i own 10,299 shares at a average of .79 do your own DD. but i hope this helps :)Also its crazy that this Gem is not on here already.sorry if i did something wrong i am a lurker not a writer. been here a whole 2 years and trading even more so.  but i just felt compelled to share this one in a lifetime opportunity.&#x200B hopefully you found this useful if there is something more i can add or fix do tell in the comments so that we can help each other give useful information.&#x200B TLDR &#x200B Net list sued google and google Lost. they have to take a decision on the 15 of July. most probably they will do a buy out meaning lots of  **🚀🚀🚀** .&#x200B &#x200B edit: fixing 2nd grade grammar. also please up vote guys!! i tried to give facts only&#x200B edit: 2  Google has 30 days to respond to the motion in federal court [proof](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s710.html) this is where we get the July 15 date.&#x200B edit: 3 **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 rockets to see if it boost the algorithm**&#x200B edit: 4 there's a lot of replies ill try to answer what i can &#x200B and guys i'm by no means telling you to buy this stock frankly your money is not what i'm here for, i'm here for Google Money but i just wanted to share it. &#x200B if your worried (that you have all rights to be) put it in your watch list that's all i wanted anyways to share the stock not make you guys force buy it.

But I wouldn’t be too mad if I have to hold my stock till the buyout or settlement comes I really don’t need the money right now#[deleted]#I highly doubt google will entertain buying them out.This [news](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-states-patent-trial-and-appeal-board-upholds-validity-of-netlists-912-patent-300797662.html) has been reported in the exact same form before, and it just resulted in a small pump and fall. If they really supply memory solutions to commercial companies why are they so unprofitable? They have only had 2 profitable quarters since 2006. We have been in a memory drought for the past 5 years and this company cant turn a profit for one quarter in the past 13 years?!They just look like a patent trolling operation based on the notes from the trial and how quick they are to jump into the news outlets with the information about beating google. Either way I'll watch this and see what happens but I really do not think that you will see this hit anywhere near $25.#I posted about NLST last week. Even though your DD is great, I don't think people realize the full grasp of what is happening. If Google buys them out, or agrees to pay, this isn't gonna rocket to a few dollars...it's gonna go above $10.#That was a lot of words, so I'm in.#Amazing DD. Bought 2500 shares this morning. Let’s go baby. Will hold long if I have to.#Heard this before about Netlist...#Alright I’m in the rocket with you at 4K shares. Let’s go to Jupiter#Excellent Dd but I’ve seen this stock being pitched and I’ll say the same thing I said last time these lawsuit battles can take years to come to a conclusion. Google has 100s of lawyers who will take the piss and make this battle as long as possible even if they know they don’t win they understand that NLST will spend millions fighting and maybe the day will come where they can no longer afford it. If you plan to hold long long term then it’s a good bet. Let me know if I’m wrong tho.#Gonna be honest, this one seems risky at this point in time. Google and Netlist have been fighting this for over 10 years. I can't imagine that Google is going to take this Federal Court of Appeals judgement and **NOT** at least **TRY** to file a writ with the Supreme Court. If they do file a writ, it could be over a month before we know whether that case will be heard by SCOTUS.Now let's look at the stock in question. After the June 15th ruling the stock shot up from 19 cents to almost 50 cents, and now rests at close to 70 cents. If the sentiment around this crashes down upon a SCOTUS filing, and god forbid they actually take up the case, there is no reason to believe the stock couldn't find that 20 cent floor again. Even if it only dips halfway back down that is over a third of your investment.If this is as bad for Google as this DD makes it out to be, I just don't see them not appealing. If they do... I see this dipping as those impatient ""I ain't holdin' no bags"" traders dump.I'm not saying it isn't 🚀straight to the 🌙, I'm just not sure on the timing...If I'm totally wrong, best of luck to you, and wave at me as you shoot by.#While this may be good/great DD, the timing is not. Smart money doesn't throw itself on a 3x risen penny stock that can plummet due to an appeal. Google is absolutely going to appeal this ruling, and you could see a significant portion of your investment evaporate. Hop on for a day-trade if google indeed buys out netlist, but don't throw money at it beforehand as too may risk factors.#I bought 20,000 shares ticket to this rocket. I like the prospect of settlement but also believe in the companies tech patents.#Is it a concern that it is an OTC stock?  Any chance they get on a regular exchange like Nasdaq sometime soon?  Are they even trying for that, have they filed any forms or maybe it’s too soon for that.  But anyway yeah it costs $6.99 per trade (in and out) on E\*TRADE so I can’t dick around and have this thing peeter out on me.&#x200B I mean, I’m super interested, seems like a home run. But I don’t know anything about the law, like if google can tap dance this back away from that July 15 date or not and in the meantime, NLST is an OTC stock.Thanks for the write-up, I was super interested when they got their ruling, very big news. Glad to be reminded of it.#Solid DD, Ive been following for a while, but didn't have the knowledge or desire to write up a DD on NLST.#Oh my God its like the one OTC that Webull will take 😭😭😭 buying in on this on the morning dip. Good looks OP.#Great post - I posted about this the other day but with less DD.  Think this will play out nicely.#**TLDR: July 16th is but one more stop on a long litigation route, not the resolution of the dispute between the parties. Consequently, it is unlikely that July 16th is the rocket-ship catalyst date that this poster would like it to be. If google appeals, the July date isn't a catalyst, and the resolution gets kicked farther down the line. If Google doesn't, the parties still have to prosecute their case in California which will take YEARS. This rocket may eventually go to Jupiter, but right now its not even on the launchpad.** Ok, that's not exactly how this works. July 16th is unlikely to be a major catalyst date.Source: I'm a lawyer practicing in federal court and working on complex civil litigation. I deal primarily in multi-state civil cases.While the original post does seem to largely be a re-hash of this [microcap daily article](https://microcapdaily.com/bulls-take-charge-of-netlist-inc-otcmkts-nlst/126374/), it is not without some merit. The exhaustion of the appeal right is undoubtedly good. **However**, its important to make the distinction between what this decision is, and what it isn't.The U.S. Court of Appeals' ruling is only an exhaustion of Google's petition to the US Patent and Appeal Board's (USPAB) original decision upholding Netlist's patent. There is a companion case in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California that has been under court-ordered stay since 2010, pending the resolution of Google's petition to the USPAB. This companion case is the case in which Netlist is pursuing damages for Google's infringement on Netlist's patent.Assuming, as the original poster did, that either (1) Google does not appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court (USSC) or, (2) in the event google does appeal, the USSC denies to hear the case, the next step is for Netlist to file a Motion in the California case to have the court lift the stay. The facts indicate that Netlist would likely win this motion and then would be able to proceed with its case.However, in order to recover damages, Netlist would still have to prosecute its case and win at trial. Alternatively, Netlist could enter into a settlement agreement or resolve the matter as part of a variety of commercial transactions with Google. **The problem is**, given the fact that the U.S. Court of Appeals's ruling is still within the appealable time-frame and the fact that the case in Northern California has not even entered the discovery phase (which alone could, and likely would take years) we are not likely to see any resolution to this matter in 2020.Netlist can't even move to reopen the Northern Californian case until Google's appeal rights are exhausted. Google will have an opportunity to respond to the motion and then the judge will issue an order. At a minimum, just to get an order on the Motion to Reopen will take a month. So we're looking at late August, at best, for the California case to be reopened. And then even if its re-opened, the parties are looking at **years** of litigation. Yes, a settlement or acquisition (or another type of commercial transaction) could happen at any time, but it would be reckless to assume that this dispute is anywhere near resolution.**Edit: TLDR section**#🙄 after July 15th, with no appeal by Google, CEO Hong can left the stay and this thing can head to a court room where a jury would decide what kind do monetary amount to pay for 10 years of infringement and they lied To the judge about using their tech. They opened the servers and bam 💥 they got caught red handed. Hence the current court victory. This also includes treble damages(times 3) in the monetary amount. Google will most likely not want that jury. If google could even goto Supreme Court(rule 36 makes this unlikely) and loses again(which they will), won’t look good for the company. And I think they don’t want SCOTUS deciding How much they have to paid. Most logical is a settlement and licensing agreement.A BO would be nice but that’ll only give a poison pill of 6.56, I’d rather hope it’s a settlement.#Where’s the news 😫#I’ve been in for a little bit starting at .32 and have since averaged up with over 13k shares. I’ll wait Good write up, minus the talk about tendies and lambos.#It looks like they are asking to do an offering:      The Board believes the proposed increase to the authorized shares of our  common stock is desirable, and is requesting that our stockholders approve the  increase, for the following reasons:    • ***Flexibility for Future Stock  Issuances for Any Corporate Purpose.***  The requested  increase to the authorized shares of our common stock is also intended to  provide us with the flexibility to issue our common stock as needed for any  other purpose the Board may approve in the future, which could include, for  instance, raising further capital to support our operations  compensating  employees or other service providers  effecting stock splits or dividends or  other capitalization changes  acquiring assets, technologies or businesses  and  other corporate purposes. If this Proposal No. 3 is approved, the newly  authorized shares of our common stock would be issuable for any proper corporate  purpose. Historically, we have issued our common stock (or securities  convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our common stock) to raise  capital, in connection with strategic transactions and relationships, as  compensation to attract and retain our personnel through grants of equity  awards, and for other general corporate purposes. Since January 2017 through  June 9, 2020, we have issued common stock (or securities convertible into or  exercisable or exchangeable for common stock) totaling 154,234,111 shares (on a  fully diluted basis) for the reasons described above, and our Board may desire  to use our common stock for these or other reasons in the future. Of these  shares, since January 2017, we have granted equity awards for compensatory  purposes for a total of 8,577,389 shares of our common stock (on a fully diluted  basis), and the Board believes the availability of additional shares for future  compensatory purposes is an important recruiting and retention tool.           We currently have no specific  commitments, oral or written, which would require us to issue a material amount  of new shares of our common stock, except with respect to the issuance of shares  of our common stock (1) upon the exercise or conversion of outstanding  securities, and (2) in connection with the Equity Plan and awards granted  thereunder.&#x200B   **Possible  Adverse Effects if this Proposal No. 3 Is Approved**          If this Proposal No. 3 is  approved by our stockholders, the Board would generally be able to issue the  additional authorized shares in its discretion from time to time without further  action by or approval of our stockholders, subject to and as limited by the  rules and listing requirements of the OTCQX or any other then applicable  securities exchange and the requirements of all applicable law.          Approval of this Proposal  No. 3 could have the following adverse effects:    • ***Increased Potential for  Dilution.***  If approved, this Proposal No. 3 would  result in our Board's ability to issue the newly authorized shares of our common  stock in the future in its discretion and without obtaining further stockholder  approval. Because our stockholders do not have preemptive rights with respect to  our common stock, they would not have preferential rights to purchase any  additional shares we may issue in the future. Consequently, any issuance of  additional shares of our common stock that is not pro-rata among existing  stockholders would increase the number of outstanding shares of our common stock  and decrease the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, as well as  their percentage interest in the voting power, liquidation value and book value  of our common stock. Depending on the terms of any such issuance, this dilution  could be significant. In particular, in light of the current low per share  market price of our common stock, our stockholders may experience material and  substantial dilution if we complete an equity financing in the near term. For  example, assuming a sale price per share of $0.20, which was the closing sale  price per share of our common stock as reported by OTCQX on June 9, 2020, and  also assuming we complete an equity financing that involves our issuance and  sale of shares of our common stock and no other securities (such as, for  instance, warrants or convertible notes), we would need to issue and sell  50 million shares of our common stock in order to obtain gross proceeds of  $10 million.

They weren't joined because they're different parents, but they cover many of the same issues. That's the case where google servers were subpoena'd and had direct evidence of infringement (intentional infringement). NETLIST has already moved for summary judgment in that matter and the subsequent decision, along with the PTAB record, will effectively be law of the case/preclusion in the 912 matter.#Can you explain how they get the 6.56 number?

The researchers typically dont care about the patents because they are the property of the university and not theirs. They are already working on a different grant funded project anyway. It's just a machine to increase the cost of doing business  it's definitely not as noble as they are protecting ip instead of chasing profits that's just hilarious and naive.#[deleted]#What stop loss percent/number are you setting?#Of course! Actually see some good potential! Let’s see what happens#Maybe your right, maybe your wrong. I sunk a lot into this in 2018 and nothing came of it. I'm steering clear (partly because it's not supported by Robinhood anymore anyways) but best of luck.#definitely that's all i wanted that people can have a look at it, in the best case scenario its first come first served. &#x200B Google definitely has the will to take it further but it just makes way more sense that they would do a buy out i feel like that's option number 2 if Netlist are unwilling to take a buy out and in such case that will be another battle that, by the looks of it NLST has the favors in winning. &#x200B it's a penny stock Risk is obviously high here but lets hope to a nice outcome :)#Google also saves money by just buying this company out, owning the patent and avoiding the penalties.#Ok don’t quote me on this but I do think the judge has a certain amount of months before he has to come up with a verdict once a motion is filed. There is also a possibility that the motion can be dismissed which would further prolong the court case. Not 100% tho#So July 15th should be the end correct?#I think you are right, there is probably something good on the horizon here, I just think it’s very likely that google requests the Supreme Court, which adds many weeks to a real answer here. I’ll definitely keep an eye out.#Yes, it is unlikely that SCOTUS takes the case, but I don't think it is unlikely that Google will file a writ to TRY to have them take the case. If filed, it would likely be many weeks (4-6) before we find out SCOTUS' answer. We know that people are impatient with these pennys, and I don't trust people to not dump if they learn it will be over a month before their sweet tendies arrive. My analysis here is on the people, not the case.#If the play is solely for the 15th, find a good entry point either Monday or Tuesday and then pull the parachute if it starts to increase dramatically on the 15th/conversely if it starts falling drastically on that date.#You seem really nonchalant for someone who stands to lose 70% of their investment if this thing tanks.

Sorry!#Hong just stated Apple is a new client, so it seems very likely multiple offers are on the table. Either way, sales must be approved#I honestly kinda think you’re pumping more than anything with this post. Do you know anything about patent infringement law? Because to receive damages for lost sales, you have to prove that you could’ve made those sales yourself. And I doubt NLST can do that. The more likely outcome is that the court eventually assigns a royalty on future sales and that NLST won’t recover anything from prior infringement money made by Google and others.#I don't know why you're being a dick, but you didn't even try to respond. A hostile takeover is when someone attempts to buy over 50% of the shares on the open market. That is not an option if insiders own the majority of shares.Being a prick is easier than thinking about the facts I guess#remember i'm talking about the court ruling the sell off at this point would be a micro problem&#x200B but just put it in your watch list i feel like this can definitely be interesting#yeah this is true but the reason it tripled its price is because on the 15th they won the 10 year patent war. &#x200B put it in your watch list you don,t have to jump in :)#Hmm true still a pretty long hold if the Judges take their time to look over all case files and what not could easily take the 3 months. And even then google won’t immediately have to pay the settlement and that could take another couple months right? They’ll have to then go through the entire negotiation process of how they’ll compensate NLST and when they’ll be ready to pay the settlement which could be in chunks especially if they’re making billions off of it for a decade. I really want to get In and have been following this for weeks. But I feel like right now is too early to tell. I do agree tho if they win this court battle and receive settlement this stock will go parabolic and make millionaires.#Watch, these accounts won't be anywhere to be found on the 16th.

They just had their patent’s validity affirmed.#What you are describing is not a hostile takeover. The very essence of a hostile takeover is that the board does not approve of the takeover.

Way before the court case rapped up. The CEO does this to pay for his lawyer fees and expenses to keep up production.  He also handed out notes to oa handful of companies(1 or 2)that also helped him in other lawsuits. With said note, they get x amount of shares of netlist in which they can sell at a certain price. promissory note stock. OP also failed to mention that because of the google ruling, another court case with another company , did the something, Is on hold until the google case is done.  They want to see what google will do. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/promissorynote.asp#He's selling like crazy.

Lol good luck shilling#Yeah this has danger written all over it.Stock rises from .20 average to almost 90 multiple days before any of this news comes out.The CEO is selling off his shares....I’m good lol#Could be true , he still owns 7 million shares or so I believe , and he has sold off regularly in the past but this has been the largest amount ever#They're awarded cash or shares in the new company. They definitely don't need to dump them on the open market.#It's posted on their LinkedIn page now. But I stand by my Hong comment#But you’re just basing it on what Google has made (and you haven’t given any sources on how you even determined that).Your mistake is that you’re assuming the settlement amount will be in the ballpark of what Google has made by infringing on it. That is probably not the case.#It's not just semantics because that difference matters a lot for the shareholders. An attempted hostile takeover via acquisition of open market shares would be fantastic for shareholders because it would drive the price up, either naturally or directly with a tender offer.#you need weed#I can definitely see why you have concerns, maybe I can clear some of it up. The reason this has went from .20 to almost .90 as you stated is because of this news. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/netlist-prevails-against-google-at-the-u-s-federal-circuit-court-of-appeals-01592305557As op stated this was ruled in netlists favor 3-0. It was also considered a rule 36 judgement. Out of 15 rule 36 judgments that have tried to appeal to the Supreme Court, zero have been accepted. As for your  CEO sell off concern. This was a Rule 10b5-1 which lets insiders sell a predetermined amount of shares at a predetermined time. To me, this was not insider trading.#Ohhhhh ok ok thanks for the heads up!#Right but the CEO still elected to sell at that time when he wasn’t required to.Thanks for the info though, that’s good to know about writs being denied for rule 36 judgments"
datascience;i0y3po;1596157097.0;/r/datascience/comments/i0y3po/how_big_is_big_data/;How big is “big data?”;Admittedly, “big data” is a phrase I hear mostly from non-data scientists who are trying to impress people but I’m curious: when someone tells you they work with big data or list it as a skill on their resume, what do you imagine? Terabytes? Petabytes? Exabytes? Maybe it’s not about the actual size but how you use it, for example the ability to set up a spark cluster that can scale up and down as needed or to use tools like dask. Just curious what people’s opinion are—if the term carries any weight or if it’s just another corporate buzz word.;"It's not about the size of the data, but how you use it. As long as you leave your stakeholders feeling satisfied, then you shouldn't have to feel in anyway insecure about your size.#When I started in the biz in the 80s gigabytes were big data.  In 1992 I worked for a vendor for a large retailer in Bentonville, AR.  They had a system with 1.2 TB, which at the time was the largest _commerical_ data warehouse at the time.  It took something like 2400 disk drives, and 1/3 of a football field space on the floor.  Back then 1.2 TB could have been considered Big Data.Fast forward about 10-15 years later, that retailer and and other companies were hitting the Petabyte level of data.  At that time a PB could be considered big data.Today there are some companies with 10s and 100s of PB of data on their production systems, whether it be RBDMS or Hadoop based platforms.The way I look at big data is not so much the size but what type of data it is and how it is used.  Daily sales (store, item, day) was big data in the early 90s.  Then market basket data (every scan of an item) was considered big data.  Now the telemetry from all the mobile phones and IOT devices are producing vast amounts of data to analzye.  That and semi-structured data from text, video, and other types of non-traditional data sources contribute to the vast amount of data being collected today.But storing 'big data' is not the end game.  Using, understanding, and making decisions based on analysis of the big data is what big data processing is about. A human cannot look at billions of rows of data and go ""Aha! that's the answer.""  It is the meaningful analysis, and ultimately summarization of that big data into a set of metrics that humans, and in more advanced settings, automation, can make decisions based on those metrics.I hear many talk about big data in terms of size.  The people that know what to do with 'big data' talk about it in terms of it's use.#Big data is when you need specialized tools and techniques to deal with it. Typically it means horizontal scaling, parallelization between multiple nodes (many computers). Vertical scaling (beefier single computer) is easy and doesn't need any special tools or techniques. Commonly three V's are important: Volume, Velocity, VarietyAs for volume currently you can fit ~2TB of memory and 100TB+ of storage in a single node so it's quite a lot compared to 2002, when 100GB would be big data that causes problems.In addition to size, ""velocity"" of the data can be a problem without the volume being too high. With online data (data you discard after some time or streaming data) you might only have a couple hundred gigabytes at a time, but the speed at which you can process it can be the bottleneck. As of now you can get 92 CPU cores on AWS in a single machine. Quite a lot compared to 2 cores on a dual socket server in 2002.Variety is another one. 100TB in a database might not cause any problems whatsoever because the database takes care of everything, you just use SQL. If it's not so structured and queries are not so simple, even 100GB can become a problem if you need to do some heavy processing and transformations on them.In my book if you can do it on a machine with a 64 core AMD EPYC processor and 2TB of ram and 4 V100 GPU's and a few 10TB disks of storage then it's not big data. If you need more then it is.I've seen people talk about a 800MB file that crashes excel 32bit 2007 to be ""big data"".#Anything larger than you can process on one computer is big data.#[deleted]#Anything that does not fit comfortably on a modern computer is a good candidate for big data. I have a 2TB drive here. i can't imagine handling more that about 1/2 T on this machine and even then it would be stretching it.#I think it’s not just an issue of data size but also a way to approach the problem. The word big data is usually accompanied by prediction rather than explanation which allows the researcher to basically squeeze everything from the data (interaction terms, transformations, polynomials etc.) without thinking too much about finding a clear and explanatory relationship between the outcome or target or dependent variable and the  predictors or covariates. The aim is usually to give more freedom to the scientist or researcher in terms of which features and which functional forms to include in the equation. From lasso to svm to random forest to gbm to nn, you can see that the main aim is prediction. Question nowadays is whether we can use these powerful methods to understand causal relationships.#Large enough that it needs to be processed in a distributed manner.#As I understand it, big data is when the data can't fit in the memory. Big Data is also the family of tools and techniques for dealing with data on a distributed system, although the presence of the system is usually because the data are too big to fit in the analysts' computer's memory. There is a grey area where you might have data that's too big for memory but you can still use online or chunking algorithms to get through it piecemeal.#Pretty big#If I remember there is a VVV definition:Volume, too big to fit on a regular computerVelocity, increasing or updating quicklyVariety, multiple data types#In one of my classes my professor defined it as data that doesn't fit/ cannot be processed on a single (personal/standard) computer. Yes that is still *technically* ambiguous but a lot more defined than I ever heard it#Big Data  means your data is more than you can easily process/analyse on your current infrastructure. Little cynical - but I was around when Teradata claimed it was a Big Data environment.It's really an executive buzzword like Tiger Teaming.What we think is Big Data today will be not so big tomorrow.That IoT tsunami is on its way...#In college I had a textbook titled “Too Big To Ignore”. So I’m going with that!#I deal with cookie level ad server data that is down to the impression level for sets of clients. Because its silod into clients the data is manageable.   Typically hundreds of GB to TB size data stores and these are quite painful to run normal SQL queries against.  I'd say this is when you want to start running Spark jobs.#I don't think there's a true definition for it. I define it as being when the size of the data is the main, or one of the main challenges in working with it. To be honest, I work with data sets where how SMALL the data set is becomes the main challenge. Like a sales rep has 18 months of sales under his or her belt in a low volume industry and I'm supposed to tell them the characteristics that define an ideal customer and provide a sales strategy for growing their territory. I'm all about that Bayes.#I'd say any data that is large enough that it needs to be processed on a cluster is big data. Today I was working with a satellite lidar dataset that required 1TB of ram to process, can't do that on my PC.#As a data engineer in fintech I believe that data with at least two out of four V's should be considered big data: volume, velocity, variety, and _veracity_. Data with truly extreme volume and velocity are rare, and often, purposefully procured with producer systems you own, so variety or veracity issues may not be significant (or at least it's on you and you can make it better).On the other hand, my data is small in volume or velocity, but data comes from literally everywhere at their whims with zero controls or influence from my side. Worse, being fin*, I have very little margin of error, so it leads to big trust issues, and I need all kinds of checks and alarms for whom computing resources must be scaled out. Therefore, I believe high-variety poor-veracity data is still big data.I guess my point is that big data is any mass of data that requires big effort to provide business value. Size was the only determinant initially, perhaps since daily-run batch processing was dominant  but, as the field matured and expectations rose, it is natural that the number of determinants also grew.#Is the data blue? Is the data binary? Then it's big data.Serious answer: Big Data is data that can't fit on a single computer locally. Medium Data is things that are too big for a single person to reasonably view and interpret.#When I hear term big data then I assume that the people telling that havent got data science experience. That person for me is more data hustler.#I always vviewed it  as dependent  on the tech  that  is used. Things like spark.#I think of ""big data"" as being too big to work with in a reasonable amount of time on your personal computer.  Once you start needing to process it or train a model in a distributed way, you have big data.#I always get the sense that what big data means is that the scale of the data that is collected or the analysis being done to it is complex enough that it requires a different regime of consideration and methods to accomplish things with that data. For example, GMail is a version of a service that could theoretically serve a handful of people, save a few records relatively securely in a server you keep in your basement. Gmail on the other hand is a multi-redundant cloud service that has no fixeed location, is stored in data centers so large that they require a steady stream of fresh hard-drives to keep it going, because they literally burn through one in a matter of hours. Dealing with that requires logistics, special programming methods, special methods for handling cryptosecurity, managing clocks, generating random numbers, and so forth. At least, that's what I think of when I hear people discussing big data, whether what they're talking about is that or not.Affixing 'Big' to things in order to elevate their importance is pretty typical of marketing double speak.#I have a friend in the oil prospecting industry who regularly works with PB of data. Some of the physics experiments were (I think the large hadron collider) were generating more than that 15 years ago.#The original definition of big data is data that is bigger than can be fit into a single server.#I tend to think of “internet big” and everything else.Also there’s a lot of data which is “small” in GB but very information intensive. If you hang an ICD-10 code off the back of a healthcare record, you suddenly have a rich/deep taxonomy which you can do all sorts of things with. Specialist clinical audit data can be 1,000s of records and highly significant.Not that massive volumes are “low quality” but they can start off as “lower information density”#In my role, data is measured in Megawatts.#To me, it’s enough data that can’t fit in the memory of one machine so you have to use tools to process it in parallel.#A definition I like is ""The data, that is too big to be efficiently processed by a SQL database""#basically, bigger than being able to load the whole dataset on a typical machine's memory, so +16 GB#I'd say it is not so much how many data points but the number of variables and data types which makes data 'big'.#It majorly reference to the dataset which has huge data points and complex structure.

That’s basically the functional limit of Microsoft excel and Access and when you start needing other data sciencey tools.#Whatever doesn’t work in excel#As far as I see it, big data is any data set big enough to be considered highly dimensional and allow machine-learning to be performed. In practice, a few hundred observations for a few thousand samples can be considered 'big data', as the challenges that arise during analysis are very similar to those of thousands of observations and samples. Personally, I work with data on the TB scale, usually with millions of samples and thousands of observations.#My impression is that the main difference between ""Big Data"" and ""conventional"" data, is that ""Big Data"" is collected without knowing what exactly to do with it later.That's why ""Big data"" is rarely conveniently structured in the way you need it to draw your conclusions and that's why you need special tools to deal with it.&#x200B It's not necessarily or mainly about dealing with just large quantities of data, it's about dealing with a lot of data that's not relevant for the task and extracting insights that the data wasn't meant to provide when it was collected.&#x200B I'm sure though that this is just my personal impression and that there are plenty of use-cases, where the sheer size of data really is the main challenge.#It's relative to the environment. If the environment is limited in all aspects of resources (e.g. credit card chip), then a 1MB data can be ""big"" to it.#lawful evil interpretation insprired by ""deep"" neural nets: any dataset with one than one data point is big data just like any NN with more than one layer is deep#In an average DAX Company, big data begins at about 100 rows in an excel...#It's more of the skills that come along while dealing with data. The libraries like spark can comply as requirements arise. The term is loosely defined, the data in CSV format can be a GB but the same data when compressed to a parquet format might reduce more than 90%#There are four V's of ""Big Data"": Volume, Velocity, Veractiy, and Variety. If your data has a few of them, or even just one, there are tehcniques in Big Data that will help address those properties. It's not always Volume/Velocity, or huge amount of data coming in fast. It can be variety, having to parse and make uniform data from disparate sources in different formats. It can be Veractiy, data from quesitonable sources that needs more introspection and more circumspect analysis before results can be trusted.#BigData is when the dataset doesn't fit into an Excel sheet.#I think it mainly refers to the amount of data we have and not the size. Like 50K images of dog for training a classification model. Or census data from 1920 to 2020 which could probably be somewhere around 20B rows in excel, if that in any case is possible is big data.That being said is very much possible that the size of 20B rows excel sheet is smaller than the 50K dog images. :)#Provost and Fawcett (2013) define Big Data as data-sets that are too large for traditional data-processing systems and that therefore require new technologies.The O’Reilly Radar definition of Big Data is a situation where the size of the data itself becomes part of the problem.Cooper and Mell (2012), ‘Big data is where the data volume, acquisition velocity, or data representation limits the ability to perform effective analysis using traditional relational approaches or requires the use of significant horizontal scaling for efficient processing.’The general academic consensus is that 'big data' is a five-dimensional measure taking into account 1) data volume, 2) data variety, 3) data velocity, 4) data variability, and 5) data complexity.  In corporate America, it is still fairly very rare to see data sets that really are ""big data"" from an academic perspective. That doesn't mean they can't be analyzed using big-data techniques, it's just that they don't necessarily need to use big-data techniques. Provost, F., & Fawcett, T.

Tackling big data, Federal Computer Security Managers’ Forum#There are no hard-and-fast standards, but a working rule of thumb for me is that if you can easily provision a VM with enough RAM to fit the entire data set, it probably isn't ""big data."" That standard will obviously change over time, but right now it's probably in the low terabytes. You know you're in the realm of ""big data"" when you start running into serious technical limitations.In practice, I've found that many ""data scientists"" work with small data (a few tens of gigabytes) and fairly basic business analytics. That's still an enormously useful and valuable thing to do, but qualitatively different from the kind of heavy lifting you might need the Hadoop ecosystem for.#I think the difference is ""too big to fit in main memory"" so you have to use something like spark to efficiently process it, but the accurate answer is whatever business wants it to mean.#Big enough for you to need a cluster (hortizontal scaling / parallelization ) to perform your ETL and other processess, in a meaningful timeframe.This could be huge files that need to be processed daily overnight, or smaller files that need to be processed instantly (streaming).#There's not a set data size that's considered ""Big Data."" In fact, at one point back in the 90s 1 gigabyte was considered ""big data"" (can you imagine?!). However, the typical company in the small and medium-sized business market has access to nearly 200 terabytes of data. Usually these businesses are only harnessing a fraction of it to create innovative advantages.**Some big data services include:**\- auditing existing data: whether HR, CRM etc to make sure there aren't any missed opportunities where you could be leveraging the data you already have\- set up new data collection points if needed\- automate the analysis: big data analytics doesn't require constant effort and monitoring rather it often goes hand-in-hand with artificial intelligence and machine learningCertified Professional Data Engineers can automate the process of data collection and analysis by setting up data engineering pipelines so you directly get processed information instead of having to go through gigabytes of data.More info:  [https://bit.ly/3fwcOcd](https://bit.ly/3fwcOcd)#Big Data is a huge misnomer. Let me tell you this as someone with 20+ years of experience as a data engineer using SQL Databases, Spark, Hadoop, and NoSQL. I only got into the Hadoop/Spark/MongoDb side of things for a short while because of the hype and novelty. I thought it was cool for about a month - and then I realized what garbage those tools are 99% of the time.Let's start with how data is stored in a relational database. Let's say I have a table with one column only: Sales which contains a 32-bit integer type. Let's say that I have 10 billion records in that table with number values averaging 1000000000 (one billion). How much space does that take? Each number, stored in binary format, takes 4 bytes. 4 bytes x 10 billion = 40 000 000 000 bytes or 40 gb. That's it - 40 gigs.Now let's store that same number in JSON format. It contains a metadata tag and a column: ""Sales"": 1000000000. Since it's stored in plain text, each record takes 19 bytes. So the table weighs 190 gigs already. Queries response times suck in single-node ""big data"" servers, so their answer to the problem  is to horizontally scale the data, meaning they make copies of the data across as many servers as needed to gain better throughput through parallel processing. That's pretty much what Hadoop does. So let's assume we're going light and we only have 5 nodes. That's 190x5 = 950 gigs. We're almost in terabyte territory here already  my puny 40 gb dataset is already taking up almost a terabyte of storage in the big data system. Keep in mind that there are quite a few 100+ node Hadoop clusters out there, so 100 nodes in this scenario is 19 terabytes. That's right .. 40 g -> 19 terabytes.  Now THAT's big data!Many years ago, I created a data warehouse for a large credit card company that weighed in at less than 20 g and yet it contained the records of all the call volumes of the company worldwide. I learned that they have since moved to Hadoop because, according to them, they had to manage several terabytes of data for the exact same application. Now I know for a fact that their call volumes did not multiply by a factor of millions .. so where did all this extra data come from? My guess, there is no ""extra"" data - just inefficiency.So the question is: When is ""big data"" appropriate to use? Let me illustrate with a scenario:If you go to the Library of Congress with its 16 million books and you're interested in reading books by Michael Lewis, you can go to the online terminal or even the card catalog and look up books by author name, find  Michael Lewis and it'll tell you exactly where to go. In less than 3 minutes, you're already browsing his books. If the library were to double the number of books they have, it would still take you roughly the same time to find the books. That's data storage in a SQL Database.Now imagine that instead of the library, you come across a huge warehouse with a massive, 16 million pile of books in the center. Not just books, but newspapers, lead pipes, old shoes, etc. Now you want to find all the Michael Lewis books in there. Well, you could dig in and search each book one by one until you have them all, but that would take years. Instead, you hire 100 high-school kids to sort through the books for you. With a 100 people, it should be 100 times faster. If you hire 200 kids, it's be even faster. But even with all those people, it'll  take days still .. that's just the nature of the work you're doing. But it's really the only viable way of finding those books in the absence of a cataloging and shelving system. That's ""big data"".In the scenarios above, the smart money moves the data from Hadoop and into a SQL Database. Like having the 200 kids organize the books and catalog them for you. You only do it once .. after that, your card catalog helps you find the books in minutes again. But what I'm seeing alot is people dismantling the library and chucking all the books in a big pile so they can keep hiring the 200 kids to find the books they need every time they need it.  They decommission their SQL databases and move them to Hadoop, Spark, or MongoDb and suffer horrific response times as a result.#When numbers start to be measured in ""illions""#Every single tweet in the world...#Too big to fit in an excel spreadsheet#Big data refers to tools used, not to volume of data.A big company with huge SQL server database with billions of records is not a big data.

That’s a big relief.#This is the best comment in the history of this sub#I love to put mine in a model#That’s what she said#Do you feel data analytics is more useful in modern times with that combination of the random hodge-podge of data (mobile, web, chat, etc) combined into one, or the old-school method of querying your best selling items for example? I feel like its the former.#Dimensional reduction is particularly useful for big data visualization - as you said, a human cannot look at a huge table and guess a relationship in the data. Yet, those algorithms provide some workaround that to generate lower-dimensional representations that make sense (the relationship between the samples is preserved), such as PCA or UMAP.#Good answer. It sounds like in the age of cloud computing, it’s less about how much data you can handle and more about how efficiently you can do what needs to be done.#| I've seen people talk about a 800MB file that crashes Excel 32bit 2007 to be ""big data""...Files too big to open, save or work with is a pretty common scenario. Poor processes or software can be the culprit in some instances.An 800MB file is a challenge for most powerful desktop and network systems to manage -- the ""volume"" of your definition. A database table of this size is ho-hum, but if a shop has to routinely ingest and process discrete files of this size, I would call that big data on the volume part of this definition.I've never seen a desktop computer with 2TB of ram. I doubt many single servers carry that much ram.#If you ask the business analysts, it's anything that can't be opened in a spreadsheet XD.#Agree with this. Big data to me is usually when pandas data frames don’t work well so you have to go to a big data framework like Spark to work with the data. But the size of big data ranges as what I described is the minimum threshold. But there is a difference between big data and ridiculously big data that is generating faster than can be processed by traditional infrastructure.#To me, Big Data isn't about the raw size of the dataset. It's the span of it. If you have data streaming in from sources all over the world and it's growing non-stop, that could be Big Data.#What do you mean by ""blue?""#Yeah that’s sort of how I feel. An actual data scientist would probably say they work with spark, Hadoop, cloud environments, etc. It’s like someone in Fintech saying they work with “big money”#Uh no...

pennystocks;hptb2y;1594555235.0;/r/pennystocks/comments/hptb2y/paso_due_diligence_rockets_inside/;$PASO Due Diligence, Rockets Inside!;" Hello, and thank you for reading my due diligence post.  For full disclosure I own shares of this company.    There is a TL,DR at the bottom.  **Patient Access Solutions** ([$PASO](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/PASO/security)) is a company traded on otc market.  On their own, the company had a fiscal 2019 of 2 million in revenue, 2.8 million in assets, and just under a million in liabilities.  However, that's not why we're here.  The security details for this company are fairly strong:* Authorized Shares: 750,000,000* Outstanding Shares: 740,592,454* Float: 150,782,952 * In addition, there has been significant insider buying of shares on the open market by members of the board.   Joseph Gonzalez and Jarvis Shockey have combined to purchase 40 million shares of this company ([$PASO Disclosures](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/PASO/disclosure)).  Those shares are locked for a year.  * There has also been further insider buying in the forms of friends and family totalling \~50 million ([Pages 4 and 5](https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/250338/content)).  * Because of all of this insider buying of locked shares, this stock trades very thinly (average 10-day volume of 9 million shares, 1.7% of O/S).  It can gap up very quickly.  Many people have been holding their shares in anticipation of what is to come.  **That's great, but why are we here?** On May 29th, a binding letter of intent ([Link to LOI](https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/248195/content)) was submitted for a joint venture of UST Global and Sirius IQ to merge into the $PASO shell.  This joint venture will be known as CLX Health.  Speculation about what this joint venture is has run rampant (and I'll discuss more below) but here is what we know: * UST Global ([Link](https://www.ust-global.com/)) is a massive conglomerate, with over 25,000 employees and offices in over 25 countries ([UST Global's Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UST_Global)).  The closest number we have to a hard valuation for US is ""over 1 billion"" as of June 2018 ([Link](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/ust-global-raises-250m-from-temasek/)) common speculation that I have seen is that the company is currently worth \~3.2 billion.  In November of last year, they purchased Contenio Health, which specializes in healthcare data ([Link](http://contineo-health.com/))* SiriusIQ ([Link](https://www.siriusiq.com/)) is the smaller of the two companies involved in this joint venture.  Per Sirius's LinkedIn, "" SiriusIQ focuses on next-gen AI with workflow automation that streamlines business processes, conversations, analytics and more. The solutions are faster, better and smarter and include: cloud-born, artificial intelligence and bot technologies, automation, robust reporting and analytics, intelligent conversation and dashboard/inbox management. ""  There are no hard numbers for valuation.  **I'm seeing companies working together, but how does this get me money?*** Remember that the goal of this joint venture is: ([Section 2 of the LOI](https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/248195/content)) "" CLX Health, LLC is a Joint Venture of Healthcare IT companies that have come together to identify, develop, and deploy solutions for the purpose of processing clinical information related to lab testing, results analysis, and public health engagement to deliver a safety net of technology to benefit the general public. CLX utilizes human assisted AI to monitor laboratory order and results data to create an operational database from which to deploy “digital health passes” to mobile devices identifying those individuals who are at the lowest risk to transmit communicable diseases and allowing them to re-enter the workforce immediately.  ""* On July 15th, UST Global is hosting a webinar for ""Big Data automation"" ([Link to Tweet](https://twitter.com/USTGlobal/status/1281126511697952770?s=20)).  Note that this is the same July 15th (or sooner) that $PASO news is supposed to come out, per the LOI.  This is the catalyst that you're waiting for. &#x200B **To this point, everything I've presented has been facts, the following is my speculation**: * Keeping in mind the purpose of CLX Health, I believe the company will store healthcare information in a cloud-based system to allow any healthcare association connected to CLX Health to pull records of patients.  This is how Sirius IQ, Contineo and the healthcare portion of UST Global are connected.* Because of the gag order of the LOI, there has been no public communication about this joint venture from the companies involved.  I believe this has suppressed the PPS of this stock.  The stock's PPS increase to this point has been virtually all word of mouth and due diligence of investors. * This joint venture is being managed by a a New York-based equity firm that manages over $50 billion in assets ([Link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/13/1984585/0/en/Patient-Access-Solutions-Inc-Shareholder-Update.html)).  In my opinion, this firm isn't going to waste their time on a pump and dump penny stock.**I appreciate the time you put into this, but I have 20 other pennystocks I might buy on Monday, can you give me a TLDR?** 🚀 Cloud-based healthcare data company, reverse merger catalyst on Wednesday. 🚀";"This submission is flaired as ""DD.""

Down 45% on Wednesday#Who else skipped to the end of his DD for the rockets?#[deleted]#What platform do you use to trade OTC stocks#Not sure if I’m reading this right but the lowest ask right now appears to be $1.#Anyone concerned about the dips?#I have previously posted that I think this stock is a sham once you do your own DD.That said, I'm in for 1000 for the hype.#It has already mooned 1100% in the last six months#Smells like a pump and dump. If I had a dollar for every time we’ve been told a stock was being bought by “family and friends” and about to rocket I’d be wealthy.Edit: You guys can downvote all you want, lose your money. It won’t change the inevitable. Edit 2: I am shocked to see it down 45% on 7/15. Who could have foreseen this tragic turn of events. I am truly shocked.Edit 3: Lmao down even more to -54%, go pump and dump your shit elsewhere#Great entry point, you got in earlier than I did!  I truly think we're both about to make a lot of money.#Lies#Looking forward to Weds!#Only 3 days left before announcement. 100k hodl till 🌚🚀🚀🚀#We're getting there!#Lies#Nice entry.  I think we're both about to make some money!#Two hearts forming a cloud - that's clever#Invite me to your mansion when we’re done here!#I knew if I didn’t I would get called out. Have to follow the sub’s rules, hah!#I respectfully disagree.  The more due diligence you do in a stock, the more informed decision you can make.  As I did due diligence on this stock, I kept finding more things I liked, so I kept looking further.The original timeframe for this reverse merger was supposed to be Q1, but was delayed due to COVID.  Look at the buying in that timeframe, notably all of the people with the last name Gonzalez (Joseph Gonzalez was CEO at the time, [Link](https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/250338/content)).  Those shares are locked for a year, they aren't buying shares in a pump and dump.Best of luck to you and any tickers you are invested in. :)#I use E*Trade#I wouldn’t read too much into level 2 thus far away from the bell. Look to see where it is about 10 mins before open.#Nope, I bought in at .095 this morning.  Its been fluctuating, but it already touched .12 today.Market makers were playing games this morning.#The DD done by OP and others are extensive, it's all about a reverse merger which is very likely happening on the 15th. Why is it a sham?#Dude so has Tesla, but they both still have a catalyst coming up so people are buying the rumor.#You realize that’s only one small aspect of what makes this stock so intriguing... just such a lazy comment#Haha. GL bud. If you’ve done your DD, this is far from a P&D.#That's a fair concern.  Because these assets are being managed by a PE firm with $50 billion in assets (link above in my DD post) that risk is mitigated (IMHO)#If only there was a way to verify that... but besides a sarcastic comment, you can check out the disclosures on OTCmarkets.com to the see the share purchases. Nothing wrong with being skeptical.#Says a guy whos been here for 1 month#[deleted]#[deleted]#Cool thanks#I'm not going to go deep into my reasons other than to say that they only have 1 SEC filing (contrary to anything your reading here) with the ACTUAL SEC... [TD showing only 1 SEC filing](https://imgur.com/a/Ggiy0SF)[SEC.gov not showing ANY of the required forms for insider purchases](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/dateRange=all&startdt=2000-01-01&enddt=2020-07-12&category=all&locationType=located&locationCode=all&ciks=0001393570&entityName=Patient%2520Access%2520Solutions%252C%2520Inc.%2520(CIK%25200001393570)&page=1)Not to mention other inconsistencies... Website redirection (pashealth.com redirects to OTCMarkets.com), their building (CIIS Center) is permanently closed (go Google it yourself)... Just something off... I hope I'm wrong for everyone's sake (even my own, I'm in it too for the hype), but yeah....#Hey well just a moment that wasn't a criticism more of a benign comment. This is on my watchlist and I'm thinking of pulling the trigger. Just want to learn more about the company atm...it looks fairly solid. GNUS and IDEX have sobered me but I'm in no way plugging my eyes and ears to something potentially profitable.#How’s PASO today bud?#>this is far from a P&DDown 50% lmao#Says a guy who sees it down 50% the day after warning everyone.#Try Ameritrade TOS#I have. :)  Total current liabilities are 143k.The list of disclosures I linked in my DD post didn't even consider stock issuances, all open market purchases.  Its pretty obvious that you don't like the stock, and that's okay.  Good luck on your other trades.#The critical eye is definitely appreciated, god knows we need more of it around here, but I believe you've made an error in your assessment of PASO. From what I can tell, the error circles around the legitimacy of the OTC markets site. Do some DD on what that site is and why it may be considered 'legitimate.' &#x200B As to your 'missing' SEC filings check out this section of the [OTC Markets](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/PASO/disclosure) page (after your investigation into legitimacy, of course). If you look at the OTC filings, you'll find a lot of the info you're looking for, and if you scroll down, you can see the SEC filings line up with what you found on the SEC site. &#x200B Also, check out filing requirements of Pinks vs OTCQB vs OTCQX. glty#I upvoted you, I didn’t take your comment negatively#Could be a benign comment but definitely perceived by me and others as a comment saying don't get in now because it's already mooned.#You win#Ok, fair enough, I didn't not know there are different filling requirements (I did research after you pointed it out. Thank you.) It would also explain the website redirection. It does not explain why the CIIS Center is permanently closed and the current address points to a post office unit.*** Edit during original writing of this comment:I called the number listed on OTCMarkets and explained that I'm a potential investor and asked some questions explaining some of my concerns.I was told that the CIIS Center is closed and that it is reopening in the next few weeks with a new name. I was not told said name.When questioned about the mailing address shown on OTCMarkets, I was told that it is a mail drop for them and that their actual office location is in Woodbury, NY. I was not given a specific name or location. Just ""Woodbury, NY"".Obviously he was not about to divulge anything about the reverse merger.I feel like *some* of my concerns have been allayed. Carry on. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 baby!#Either way all good to be honest...this sub has been mentioning $PASO for a while now and it has finally caught my eye...don't really know much about it.#Not really my problem...#Actually it is. Perception is reality my friend. Don't take responsibility for your words much?#See this is a red flag to me why would someone be so hostile if they weren't pumping a shit stock. Sounds to me like you are.#I'm not pumping the stock. Got in Friday for a small amount. Just hate to see people making negative dumb low effort comments, when they haven't done any research. If you are going to make a negative comment on somebody's hard work thread, at least put some effort into it"
magicTCG;hmypve;1594142180.0;/r/magicTCG/comments/hmypve/mtgjson_version_5/;MTGJSON Version 5!;Hello fellow Planeswalkers!This post is aimed at those who are developing Magic: The Gathering tools, content creators, and those researching with big data in trading cards.My name’s Zach, and I have been leading the [MTGJSON project](https://mtgjson.com) for the past two years now. In case you’re not aware of who we are and what we do, MTGJSON provides stores, apps, and developers Magic: The Gathering card data at no cost to help advance their products.We’re super pleased to bring the 5th major revision of MTGJSON to the community for aspiring mages and seasoned pyromancers to experiment with! Version 5 brings a complete overhaul, including adding more set information, publishing prices from various vendors, supporting better booster data, and adding better documentation. You can check out the full changelog at https://mtgjson.com/changelog/version-5/Here are a few amazing projects the community put together using MTGJSON:- [CardHoarder](https://cardhoarder.com/)- [Cardsphere](https://www.cardsphere.com/)- [Cockatrice](https://cockatrice.us)- [LoadingReadyRun Bot](https://lrrbot.com/)- [MTGBAN](https://mtgban.com/)____While MTGJSON is and always will be a free resource for the community, by the community, we are always accepting of contributions. Whether that be via code contributions on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/mtgjson/mtgjson) or financial contributions via [**Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/MTGJSON) and [**GitHub Sponsors**](https://github.com/sponsors/ZeldaZach), every bit helps push our project to the next level.If you ever have questions on what we do, or how we can help serve your needs, don't hesitate to reach out! We're on Twitter (https://twitter.com/mtgjson/) and Discord (https://mtgjson.com/discord).____**TLDR**: MTGJSON5 is out with a lot of great changes! Consider supporting our work via https://www.patreon.com/MTGJSON or https://github.com/sponsors/ZeldaZach.Thanks for being awesome, fellow planeswalkers! This community has always shown its innovative side, and I can’t wait to see what you create next :);Love MTGJSON, keep up the good work!#This is awesome!For those who don't know what this is basically every software application that provides access to all the cards either uses MTGJSON or specifically chose not to use MTGJSON.#As someone who is just starting to develop MtG software, this is an amazing resource for me.#I'm sorry, I'm not super familiar with all that MTGJSON, and the development team is capable of, but is there some application for it to replace MORT for gleaning data from MTGO replays?#Have no idea how to use any of this and probably never will, but thanks for contributing this! Seems really helpful for someone less lazy than me :D#This awesome, and I've only been paying attention since starting in Ponder.Looking forward to them adding the Edhrec saltiness marker.#The booster structure is interesting. How are you sourcing that kind of data?#Thanks for your kind words!!#Correct! We've spent quite a number of years building this tool to be _the_ standard for Magic: the Gathering data. While it's taking a bit of time, we're seeing heavy adoption in the field and I'm super excited to see what the future holds#Please, do reach out to the community on our Discord (link on our website!) We'd love to help you out and understand what you're trying to do with your project :)#MTGJSON has nothing to do with MTGO replay data at this time, but it's an interesting concept. Nothing's impossible, but I'd need to dig further into it.#Heh, thanks! MTGJSON is aimed more towards developers and content creators than normal players. It's a machine-friendly dataset for Magic, unlike Scryfall which is a human-friendly dataset.#Can't wait either! We have a ticket open for it at https://github.com/mtgjson/mtgjson/issues/596#I spent over a year collecting data from a wide range of box openers, as well as using historic data, to generate a rough estimate of what booster packs look like. It's not perfect, but I find it to be as close as a machine can reasonably get without having every piece of information.I worked with MTG.wtf to source and collate all the data, and they provide me a private API to serve this data free to my userbase :)#I should know, I raised that ticket

You mostly have data and don’t know what to do with it.#For me, big data is a scam. There’s no real line to cross in which your database becomes a data lakeAnd to most of the people working on it, it doesn’t matter. It’s still data, but now my queries take 15 minutes to complete#Guys it's really easy. Big data is where your research improves by the volume of the given dataset.   Scientific measurements of temperature? You want specific, high precision data.   Building a personality profile of your customers?

cscareerquestions;hn5ljq;1594164133.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hn5ljq/work_is_just_not_interesting/;Work is just not interesting;I feel like most backend jobs are just not interesting. Call an API here, write the infra code there, connect to a DB here. Almost nothing requires scalability, performance, or etc. Yet, I feel like the interesting work is also on another level than what I can even do since I never dipped my toes into it. I’m talking about things like machine learning, big data, AI, etc. What can a person like me do to even target that?I hate having to write the code. However, I love designing systems. How they interact, how to make it scale, and etc. Any path for me there that won’t take me 5-7 years to be able to do (somewhere like a solutions architect or etc)? Currently at 2 years. After taking the AWS Solutions Architect, honestly, really liked understanding how these systems worked as a bigger whole. Not the nitty gritty stuff.Maybe i’m just having a career crisis?;"The less interesting and creative the work is, the better the pay should be.#I think its just the specific job/company. Working for a small but growing startup is probably your best best to be able to address these kind of issues.#> Almost nothing requires scalability, performance, or etc.Idk what backend service you’re working on but that’s just a flat out lie. Maybe it’s just your team/service but performance and scalability should always be at the forefront of design for a backend service.Also, just to explain why architects typically need more experience. The reason that companies want experience for hiring people to design systems is that they have experience in writing those systems.#“I’m a big picture guy. I don’t care about the nitty gritty details.”Does this sound like someone you’d hire to architect your systems?#I'm not sure this is unique to backend work, I would say that most jobs in most industries are not very interesting. The jobs where you get to do cooler stuff are generally more sought after and require a bigger hustle or greater luck/connections to get in.On the other hand, I'd be wary about working on the ""cool"" stuff. It's not always as cool to work on as it sounds, especially when the cool thing was chosen because it was cool and not because it's actually the best solution.#You can be a Solutions Architect for a living at AWS and other cloud companies.#have you looked into Data Engineering? Lots of scaling, configuring nodes, and high level systems design especially when working with large datasets.#As a person doing backend work at a large software company, I'm definitely dealing with scalability / performance considerations when designing and implementing systems. You don't need to switch your entire career focus to ML or AI to gain some interest in your work. Simply put, you're at the wrong team or company if you're not finding the challenge in this domain.#This is where I'm at. It feels like getting to work on interesting projects comes down to luck as much as being qualified. I've been trying to find work on distributed systems and databases, something I've studied for a while now and am quite interested in. At this point in my career it feels very hard to steer it in the direction I want rather than just taking some job.#I am feeling like you and I am changing jobs trying to move to a similar industry that offers more opportunities.My solution is to move to some management positions in 5 years so that I can hopefully avoid this situation.If I want to enjoy coding I can do it on selected task or privately at home.#Wait till you do something on the frontend and spend time listening to designers tell you all the places they want you to change the margins.... ugh...#> I’m talking about things like machine learning, big data, AI, etc. Those aren't necessarily related to scalability and performance. You might want to work for a larger company in a customer facing role where there are more customers where performance and scalability are a bigger concern.#Every job entails some boring stuff. In coding, the beginning is always the best part. When things go wrong, you can say, ""it's just in alpha stage. We'll patch it later"" or ""we'll redesign/refactor later.""But when that time comes... it's not as fun.#That's how it goes. I make six figures, spend most of my time in meetings, and I'm bored out of my fucking mind.#Should. In many cases they can just get a H1 body shop to do grunt work where the people won't complain that they haven't had a raise >3% for 5 years. Sad, but part of their compensation is a (potential) green card, and staying with the same employer makes it easier.#Feel like this explains my job#I wouldn't generalize like that. There are far too many boring SW jobs that are nor interesting nor creative that are also underpaid.#That explains why software engineers make so much money ...#That's how it should be but I'm not sure if that's how it is... Have you read the book Bullshit Jobs?#This. But it depends on the startup as well.Working at an enterprise company, they already have their customers, they already know what is the scope of the project.At a startup with big dreams, you don't know how big it's going to grow and so you need to consider scalability more. However, It's up to the project and management at that startup whether the answer to your proposal to spend a month building a system for scalability instead of a week, will be answered by ""yeah, let's do it, we might have 10m customers"" or ""just write it quick, we need to hit this milestone, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it"".#Sorry that was my fault. I should have been clearer there. Definitely, there is always a need to think about that. However, especially in big enterprises a lot of applications are just employee-facing very low traffic projects where the team finds doing a simpler approach is just faster and cheaper than worrying about all the intracacies of making a system scalable or performant.Although, Ill admit. Correctness and restartability and fault tolerance are high priorities. I just never found yet a need to really think about performance or scalability largely because while most people think “enterprise is big!”, a lot of behind-the-scene apps are just things only 10-20 people/agents use not even concurrently.This is probably more with my company. Other companies may have backend systems that need hyper scalability and performance. I think I over-generalized.#Actually this is a necessary quality in a technical leader. You have to be able to delegate and trust your subordinates to deal with the details. However, it obviously requires that you make wise decisions about the big picture architecture in the first place.#Yes, I know plenty of people unable to see the big picture that instead focus often on unnecessary details.The more code they touch, the worse it is.This is why some people don't become Leads but Principal or anything equivalent.#Well, by that, I meant I wish not to code/implement the actual systems. I’d rather design/architect the system that others would implement. Obviously, I’d have knowledge of it, but i’d rather not focus on that. Maybe I wasn’t clear enough, even though I think I was.#[deleted]#I'll take your job#I'm the same, and I like meetings. Maybe even love. I spent my entire career trying to do more architecture and people work and less coding. It surprises me to no end when people complain about what I consider a dream job, or (mind blown)  consider boredom to be worse than constant work. Boredom is one of the highest states of man: it is the absence of negative stimuli, worry, or need for survival. IME those who have experienced sustained negative stimuli generally are thankful to be bored, or have learned to not even interpret it as boredom/ennui.#[deleted]#My advice to you would be try transferring to a customer facing team. Or a team that supports services for a customer facing team. It might help with some of the excitement you’re seeking#Of course it's necessary to be able to delegate. However OP is not just saying he wants to direct projects bigger than one person to handle, he's saying he doesn't want to deal with implementation at all.#As a technical leader, you also have to advise on the details though. It’s your job to mentor new hires, and help make key decisions, both of which require understanding of the details.#i think the term big picture is extremely vague.  Architects need to know implementation details (how each part of the system communicates, or ""adding something to Component Z so we can add x to Component A wont work because it will break Component F""), to me that is nitty gritty details.  You can delegate all you want, but you have to have the knowledge to come up with the **specific** technical requirements that people you delegate to must meet in order for things to work.ideally everyone on the team has an idea of the big picture#That was perfectly clear. And I'm saying this is much less appealing to an employer than the guy who will design as well as rolling up his sleeves and implementing stuff as well.No one's going to gamble on the big-picture-only guy unless you've already built a ton of credibility with them or you have some real great reputation coming in.#Because it turns out being bored is hard work#Nice username#As soon as I find another one, you can have it.#Different strokes for different folks. I like to stay busy.#This. For me it's exciting to know the thing I'm building has 30k+ monthly active users and our project manager gives us feedback from the users. It's cool to feel connected in this way to the end user, even if the work isn't mind-blowing.#It really is. I have a hard time trying to stay looking busy, and just staying awake. I don't get how this is so backwards that I am willing to take a pay cut to do more work....#Me too, but I'd rather be busy reading and studying stuff of my own selection (big fan of analytic philosophy), boxing, bowling, golfing, tennising... busy on my own terms after making a living. And a good living I make too, though this sub would disagree 😄#[deleted]#Do you get time for your interests, as in does your work actually require less number of hours? I would enjoy such a situation too. Or do you just rely on stuff like audiobooks while at work?#I think we've come up similar ways, and illustrate the point that 'people who have experienced continuous negative stimuli' (heavy manual labor, construction, poverty as a child, having to worry about survival needs like food and housing) 'either consider boredom to be a high state, or don't experience it as ennui at all because it signals the absence of negative stimuli'.I don't think I'm on the spectrum, but probably should reconsider it after writing those two messages.#Fewer hours. In the office, that means kindle and audiobooks. In WFH, that means the ability to take half-days if I want to play a few holes of golf, hit the gym, or have a good restaurant lunch or early dinner. The major limiting factor is that '40% meetings', which require presence. Sometimes they are spread throughout the day with 30 minute intermissions, but sometimes crammed in to shorter periods of time on fewer days, with other shorter recurring meetings that I can literally do while lifting, running, golfing, or even reading something light as long as I have access to Teams.Many weeks are about 30 hours, with weeks near to project completion and initial deployment being 60+ as they are anywhere else."
CoronaVirusTX;hybjm0;1595786752.0;/r/CoronaVirusTX/comments/hybjm0/the_mathematics_of_covid19_as_a_threat_to/;The Mathematics of COVID-19 as a Threat to National Security PART 1: On Absolute Risks, Relative Risks, and Comorbidities.;I am a physician working in the DFW area. After lurking here for quite some time and, honestly, using this subreddit to help make decisions on the ground regarding how I take care of my patients and lead my team I wanted to contribute and try to be part of the solution. I put together a short essay meant for nonmedical/ non scientific readers mapping out the most pertinent statistics in as straight forward a manner. It is part of a 2, perhaps 3 part series I am putting together on the subject. Part 1 is in regards to the idea of absolute vs relative risk in regards to covid and mortality data in general. I then acknowledge the limitations of current data and the specific challenge of applying the known data to the American population specifically given known health data. Part 2 goes on to talk about the relative risk reductions on masks, social distancing, and what the hell an R0 is and why it matters for strategic planning. I admit I make an appeal to good will at the end. Big data aside I have seen too much death and suffering these part four months. My patients need our help. I do not have a part 3 yet however it has been requested that I map out the economic damages given some of the possible decisions that may come in the next few weeks. I admit that is out of my wheelhouse. If someone with a more robust economic background wants to help me then I would sincerely appreciate it. I hope what I wrote has utility. I know that in the subreddit I am preaching to the choir but I'm hoping the way I frame the data will help y'all communicate what is at stake. “The Mathematics of COVID-19 as a Threat to National Security PART 1: On Absolute Risks, Relative…” by Dr. Dante Paredes, DO https://link.medium.com/HahvcQaLo8Edit: I apologize for the multiple posts.

One question I have about concurrent conditions like hypertension. Does that mean people who have hypertension but it is treated and controlled well AND people who have untreated hypertension have the same additional risk or is it only the second group?#Very good essays. Thanks for taking the time to write them.I have a related, question. Looking at the death data from the CDC, it looks like there is a lot of people dying of hypertension, and dementia, in some states 20 to 50% more over the collection period. Is that because there is no box for Covid 19 specifically, and the data needs to go somewhere, so they pick the best alternative box?... Being that Covid 19 morbidly is more than just respiratory?#So if I am 30 with hypertension and asthma I am right to be super cautious? I was forced back to work despite my risk factors, but I cut my hours drastically bc I am some care giver of a disabled child. Am I right to be afraid?#[deleted]#That’s what I thought. Thanks.#>For a little under two thirds of our country this virus will most likely amount to a nasty version of the flu. However for just over 100 million Americans, this disease has somewhere between an 8.5% to 20% risk of premature death depending on the medical resources available in a geographic area. Keep in mind that those numbers are assuming the current amounts of resources. As of 2020 there is currently a total of 55,663 ICU beds in the country. Consider also that it is no small affair to create another ICU bed. Also consider that the United States only has approximately 62,000 full-featured mechanical ventilators with 28,883 of (46.4%) suitable for ventilation of pediatric and neonatal patients. Now factor in the problem that even though there may be enough beds, there may not be enough nurses, doctors, and medical techs to staff them. What good is a ventilator with no one trained to operate it or an Intensive Care Unit without doctors and nurses?That is chilling.#For economic impact I'd like to challenge you to capture the federal reserve increase in debt. Printing more money obviously means that it will decrease the purchasing power of the dollar. Did we increase the rate at which we printing?#I’m sorry, but did you just say you use this subreddit to help you make decisions on how you care for your patients?#Good catch. I will make that correction right away.#Thank you. I'm glad you found it worth the time. I hope you find it useful when navigating this calamity.#And thank you for the time. Feel free to ask any questions here or via a private message or whatever.#Thanks for reading. I hope it helps you in some way.#Dude. Or ma'am. I can't tell from your username. Thank you. I'll mess around with that this week and see if I can synthesize something meaningful. Unfortunately I have a separate medical battlefield to tackle this week that is equally pertinent: the issue of chronic pain in an environment where pain clinics are closing due to COVID-19 related financial strains. It'll be interesting balancing these two fronts while maintaining sanity.#That's a brilliantly important question. The honest answer is I do not know. The way the study was designed only designated whether or not the comorbid diagnoses existed at the time of evaluation. Given how a patient usually gets admitted into a hospital it was likely determined based on simply asking the patient or looking to see if they were on antihypertensive medications. This is different from, say, trending the blood pressure after diagnosis with COVID-19 and monitoring the outcome. Based on those limitations the study implies that the elevated risk is for both controlled and uncontrolled hypertension. From what limited data I have I've been operating under the assumption that it is the underlying metabolic syndrome/ insulin resistance that causes the increased risk given that overt cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes both produce a very similar change in relative risk of death during hospitalization. This is purely my conjecture however and should not be interpreted as more than my best educated guess.#That is the working theory that is starting to emerge. The thing is that so many systems are taxed right now that it is hard to tell what is a COVID19 induced death versus a death due to complications that would not have occured if COVID19 were not a thing. We also do not currently know the full scope of this infection's effects. There is emerging data in covid as a vasculopathy which would retroactively make some portion of those hypertension deaths part of the COVID19 death count. Ultimately, though, if all cause mortality has gone up and the biggest change to the environment is the arrival of this pathogen then pragmatically the decisions collapse back into ""solve the COVID19 problem""#Do not be afraid. Be proactive and deliberate about protecting yourself. That type of situation is when having a doc draft a letter tends to be strategically powerful. A very reasonable alternative at the individual level is to have N95s and wear them at work. If N95s are not available then there are ways to craft a reasonable substitute using cloth masks and HEPA filters cut to size. The asthma is a limitation but you and your physician should be able to overcome that fine tuning your meds.P.s. I too have asthma. Wearing an N95 with it sucks but I can do it if I stay calm and make appropriate use of my inhalers/ exercise therapy. Separate from this article I posted a video online of myself training with kettlebells in an N95 so others could see it was at least possible.#Give me a few days to read it and sort out what's what and I surely will. If I don't say something by Friday shoot me a message. As I said to one of the other commenters  this is ultimately to be a conversation. In the mean time I encourage anyone to give the paper a go. I am pulled away for a couple days trying to finding pain medicine clinics in the DFW area that accept medicaid.#Ill be honest. There were a handful of times writing this that I had to walk away and recollect. It's ... Very strange looking at the big data with y'all then going back to work where that data becomes personalized. I wrote that paragraph and the ending with the intent of conveying what my colleagues and my patients are up against.#Challenge accepted.Though I will need a some guidance since this is leaving the bounds of my training and skill set. Is the assumption here that the rate of money printing can be used an a reasonable indicator of the degree of economic strain? If so what are the confounders that could blur the extent of that relationship and how could they be taken into account/ factored out?#I did. Specifically from a broader public health and staying aware of the environment standpoint. Nah. I do not use y'all for clinical decisions. This subreddit has been one of the several streams of data I'm looking through to get a sense of how Texans are responding to the medical strain. The newspapers are too slow and mainstream outlets are too politicized for me to process. With this site there is a general bias of disappointment and frustration but it is good to see that played against the generally ""everything is fine"" attitude I see from other channels.#I read this and was trying to get clarity: “Half of the patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease were hospitalized.”I think this means to read “half the hospitalized patients had cardiovascular disease or diabetes” These are two very different claims. Additionally my reasoning for believing you meant the second is I’m not aware of anyone asking for medical history upon taking the test. No one asked when i tested negative and I’ve had multiple friends / family also confirmed positive and were never questioned on this. Medical history is only inquired with hospitalization. So there would be very little if any data leading to the declaration that you have insight into all patients that had cd or diabetes. Therefore only the second statement could be claimed. But the consensus should be the same... if you have underlying conditions understand your risk is tremendously higher both with likelihood of hospitalization or worse. Thanks for taking the time to put this together. I do think you could be much more concise but definitely appreciate the time and effort.#“Lovecraftian biological asshats”This is hilarious. But in all seriousness, this is really amazing stuff. It’s cool for me to see the math explanation behind these much needed protocols. My daughter has leukemia so we have been locked down since March. The only time we even need to wear a mask is to go to her chemo appointments because we haven’t really been anywhere else. So yes, thank you for your layman’s version of what looked like complicated math... (I must admit I scrolled passed you explaining the math of exponential growth). it was refreshing and informative.#I love math. And it gives me information to fight idiots on the internet who keep saying they have some constitutional right to not wear a mask. I’m a lawyer, so i know enough constitutional stuff to argue with them, but now I have some math to argue with them. Of course the problem with arguing with idiots is they drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.#No problem prioritizing the latter - I have a few people in my life impacted by that second issue. People are in true despair from their pain. Thanks for all you are doing. (I'm female but care little about pronoun accuracy online.  Get assumed to be a man frequently & find it amusing. )#Thanks for explaining!#The masks don't bother me, I just use my inhaler more. What bothers me is they keep trying to have people come in to work until their test results come in. Im in the process of getting my medical records from my old doctor, but I haven't had insurance for years bc my son is my priority, so I'm finding it hard to find a doctor willing to write an excuse from work.#https://www.instagram.com/p/CCcirlqlHWt/?igshid=1rbzdiww8kx1l#Well that makes sense. I was a little worried at first...#I appreciate the honesty, lol. I got to find a better way to make that exponential idea more palatable. It is a fascinating and terrifying hole in our cognitive modules that we can't perceive exponential data without some manipulation--even more so when the biological threat operates in an exponential manner. ... Hence the lovecraftian-ness. Best of luck to you and your daughter. We are doing our best on our end to hold it down so that the non-covid aspects of care can stay operational.#I will admit that that exact phenomenon is what prompted me to throw in my hat and start writing about this stuff.  The neuropsychological feature that we double down when a belief system is challenged is fascinatingly difficult to work with. As best as I can the intent in these pieces is that if I can get the raw data out there in as palatable of a way as possible then it has a chance of being heard by those who disagree without triggering a barrage of defense mechanisms.How do you run your conversations? Any strategies for preventing it dissolving into a shouting match? I suspect I'm going to have many more interactions where that may occur since I'm putting myself out there.#Ha. Yeah. I probably should have been clearer on that. I'd imagine crowd sourcing my acute patient care decisions would be something like twitch plays pokemon except with a hell of a lot more malpractice claims.#I think some stuff gets lost in translation. We have a delineation of data that works like thisTest positive —> % test positive and have symptoms —> %positive and showing symptoms and require hospitalization —> %test positive have symptoms were hospitalized and now require icuEach time we talk about these as a percentage of the rank order above them we lose sight of their likelihood in the whole situation. For example if i say once you are hospitalized you have a 8-10% of needing to go to icu this is not the icu rate for all patients. This is 8% of the hospitalization rate of 18%. But even that is not technically correct because only 20% are showing symptoms. This is where the data gets finicky and hard for people to interpret. It’s not wrong but can easily be cited incorrectly when presented like this. It’s kind of like using units and changing units without informing people.#There is a line in a smashing pumpkins song that says “speak to me in a language I can hear.”  Trying to find a way to talk to people without coming across as that guy who is smashing their temple is tough. I don’t think there is a one size fits all approach. The internet makes that tougher I think. In truth this is likely a failing of the American educational system of the highest order.  We bend to the political, whims of the donor class in what we teach. Failing to prepare people to analyze and interpret data on their own. Throw in the way we have turned red vs blue politics into something that demands religious zealotry and it’s a mix that is hard to control. ZThat’s a long way to say I don’t know. I think a person has to be open to the conversation before it has any chance of success.#I hear you. I'm hoping some old school Carl Rogers-style kindness at least gets folks to open the door."
nfl;huss16;1595276048.0;/r/nfl/comments/huss16/next_gen_stats_this_new_stat_explains_why_nick/;[Next Gen Stats] This new stat explains why Nick Chubb ended up going 88 yards for a TD when he was only expected to rush for 7 yards ... here's how:;"[https://twitter.com/NextGenStats/status/1178395198075703297](https://twitter.com/NextGenStats/status/1178395198075703297)   Building upon the winning entry of Austrian data scientists Philipp Singer and Dmitry Gordeev in [the 2020 Big Data Bowl](https://operations.nfl.com/updates/the-game/2020-big-data-bowl-results/), the Next Gen Stats Analytics team is introducing a set of metrics that use player-tracking data to delve deeper into the ground game, derived from the newly developed ability to calculate **Expected Rushing Yards**.  Here is how Gordeev explained it on the [2020 Big Data Bowl discussion board](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/discussion/119400): ""If we focus on the rusher and remove other \[offensive\] team players, it looks like a simple game where one player tries to run away and 11 others try to catch him. We assume that as soon as the rushing play starts, every defender, regardless of the position, will focus on stopping the rusher ASAP, and every defender has a chance to do it. The chances of a defender to tackle the rusher (as well as estimated location of the tackle) depend on their relative location, speed and direction of movements.""  In a complex environment like football, traditional box-score statistics, like rushing yards and yards per carry, lack the context needed to reliably quantify player and team rushing performance. These stats give you only a partial picture of what happened when a rush was attempted -- the ball was moved a certain number of yards -- without telling you very much about how or why the ball-carrier succeeded or failed.  Expected Rushing Yards offers a collection of derivative metrics that will enhance our understanding of the running game. What are the chances a rusher gains at least 4 yards on a play? Or 10 yards? Or 20? Generating a probability distribution is more advantageous than single-point estimates for the sake of future analysis, because a probability distribution allows us to derive probabilistic metrics, like first-down probability and touchdown probability, in addition to expected rushing yards.";"Because the power of Chubb compels him.EDIT:  LOL Watch Baker's dot, #6.

Yoo Jaesuk will never be overtaken from the #1 spot 🙅🏻‍♂️#I hope so, i love her comedic style#I just love her. She lights up every show she's in. She's so funny at Park-Jang's LOL too.#Probably his Baeksang award, it was all over the news and articles#>Maybe because he came as the guest for 3 Meal a Day? Probably a lot of people wanted to see how he is outside the comfort of his usual RM crew and friends. I know  I was curious to see his hidden side.#I was wondering how she’s not on the list when she’s one of the most talked entertainers, also the scandal will make her rise on the rank because of the articles written about her#What scandal?#There's a possibility she isn't included on the list because she might be in a different category (singer or something) instead of as variety star.#Maybe from this show?

Oh, wow...very cool!  I did a Google News search, and that didn't even make the first page of results...Thx!#I think it was more likely bcs of the baeksang award and it was huge since he won that award competing against other veteran actors. Its all over the news outlet and internet in korea for a while.#The ranking has positivity/negativity analysis, which implies they should have data on which ones are positive and which ones are not. I am not sure how it works, but there is a chance negative news/articles will be assigned with negative points.During the Burning Sun scandal, which had hundreds of articles every day, I don't think any of the artists involved make it to the list. Also, negative news around non-top idols happen quite often but the news rarely ever pushes their ranking in the list.#She went to karaoke and live streamed and ppl criticized her for doing this when there's a pandemic.SNSD yoona was with her too#Heechul was in both idol and variety list in May (actually he is in both lists quite often).#aha! that explains it, coz her husband was on the list as well all of a sudden (he's the guy on the show with her btw)#One time in one month. That’s probably why I missed it.#I don't doubt there are those who are in multiple lists. I'm just saying that there's a chance Hyo Ri might not be considering that she's far less active on the variety front than Heechul.

It's already happening. My mom is an oncologist and before 2000 they rarely did genetic testing on tumors. Now it's so common to send a biopsy for a gene panel to see if there are targeted therapies available.One of the first and oldest is Gleevec which is specific to the BCR-ABL gene fusion caused by a common chromosomal rearrangement that you could see with a microscope. Fast forward to 2020 and we are using sequencing technologies (read largely on the Illumina platform) to find base-pair resolution mutations in tumors for treatment.Note is this only cancer. Genomics is currently being applied to family planning and general health. The technology is a little stagnant at the moment (cost of sequencing hasn't declined) but people are finding new applications everyday. Not to mention the promise CRISPR editing has, given that it is safe and approved by the FDA. Expect small specific treatments in the coming 5 years. A CRISPR (or some other more precise genome editor) revolution is still many years in the future, which is great for investors.#Plastics, only half joking.

However they claim to detect mosaic structural variation now which might have a market for early detection of cancers, but there's still more R&D needed for an approved test for that. So basically, it's real niche I wouldn't expect it to blow up. Instead I think it would probably be bought out by a larger company for their IP.#> good gene longevityWhat does that mean? A company that will make you live longer or a company that will tell you if you have genes that will make you live longer? In either case, I am not sure. The problem with direct to consumer tests is that they are not regulated very well and if they are not FDA/CLIA approved then they can make nebulous claims.#Huge state investment in the area, state sponsored industrial espionage on a massive scale, research and university resources focused on the area, and even some actual positive international collaboration.Even if IP issues block China out from the global market, China has a strong desire to supply their own chips for their internal use, and a billion person market does provide room for growth.I'm not necessarily claiming China has the means to close the tech gap, but in simpler and commoditized areas like Dram and NAND, China will eventually have some successful behemoth state backed enterprises. I'm guessing the international market will eventually be buyers as well to some degree.#Autonomous rideshare fleets get one step closer to becoming a reality.  Given the size of 5G towers, it is easy to see future cars being made with flexible solar paneling with their own tower onboard so that they become not only a means to transport people from Point A to Point B, but they will also be a node for the network, and a source of energy that will power the vehicles and possibly provide energy to a grid assuming you dig up Nikola Tesla's old work on wireless electricity transmission.Industrial/factory automation becomes more streamlined and efficient.It is also a tailwind for cyber- and network security because letting terrorists crash a bunch of autonomous vehicles on the L.A. freeway would be some serious shit.Drone ""servants"" will boost commercial agriculture as well as household gardening.

Seems like God would have a unique, infallible method of determining the truth.  But alas, his method is indistinguishable from every other con in history.#This was a good description of my last day. I spent it looking, trying to find just one piece of evidence for the fantastic claims. Just one was all I needed at the time to keep going (at least for a bit longer). But no matter how I searched, there was not a single bit of clear evidence for TSCC. And so much against it.#It's all smoking guns.#Unfortunately the people who are in will argue that the “smoking gun” is the BoM. No matter what evidence there is that it isn’t true#Right on!  I am coming to the same realization.  If this were the only true church wouldn't it at some point be easy to prove ***partially*** that it was the only true church?  But as time goes on the God of the gaps gets larger and larger.  I am 40 and grew up in the church, over the past year or so, I now also realize every truth I was taught, every ""saving"" ordinance I participated in, and all the time and money I have poured into the only ""true church"" is predicated upon a messy history.  Every supposed item from Mormonism that is supposed to be great, turns to be founded upon polygamy, lies, deceit or a whitewashing of history.  I am sad at this realization but am also profoundly grateful.#I agree. That's one catchy one-liner to have up on your sleeve to throw at TBMs.#50 years down and 50 years to go. It is good to be free.#More like machine guns everywhere.#Wow, I need this on a tee shirt ... I mean seriously! “Nothing good in Mormonism is unique and nothing unique in Mormonism is good” AMEN!#Smoking machine guns:)"

However, unlike influenza and other viruses, the burden of the disease in patients with asthma has been less evident. Objective: This study aims at a better understanding of the burden of COVID-19 in patients with asthma and the impact of asthma, its related comorbidities, and treatment on the prognosis of COVID-19. Methods: We analyzed clinical data from patients with asthma from January 1st to May 10th, 2020 using big data analytics and artificial intelligence through the SAVANA Manager clinical platform. Results: Out of 71,192 patients with asthma, 1,006 (1.41%) suffered from COVID-19. Compared to asthmatic individuals without COVID-19, patients with asthma and COVID-19 were significantly older (55 vs. 42 years), predominantly female (66% vs. 59%), had higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemias, diabetes, and obesity, and smoked more frequently. Contrarily, allergy-related factors such as rhinitis and eczema were less frequent in asthmatic patients with COVID-19 (P < .001). Higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity was also confirmed in those patients with asthma and COVID-19 who required hospital admission. The percentage of individuals using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was lower in patients who required hospitalization due to COVID-19, as compared to non-hospitalized patients (48.3% vs. 61.5%  OR: 0.58: 95% CI 0.44-0.77). During the study period, 865 (1.21%) patients with asthma were being treated with biologics. Although these patients showed increased severity and more comorbidities at the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) level, their hospital admission rates due to COVID-19 were relatively low (0.23%). COVID-19 increased inpatient mortality in asthmatic patients (2.29% vs 0.54%  OR 2.29: 95% CI 4.35-6.66). Conclusion: Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases in patients with asthma has been low, although higher than the observed in the general population. Patients with asthma and COVID-19 were older and were at increased risk due to comorbidity-related factors. ICS and biologics are generally safe and may be associated with a protective effect against severe COVID-19 infection#So is this saying that asthma probably makes getting Covid worse, but not by much?#[deleted]#But also saying that their mode of treatment for asthma may also give a slight protective effect, which makes sense since they are steroids a lot of times.#More complex. Inflammatory asthma and allergic asthma are not the same thing and arguably have important different triggers. The did not tease out asthma without: ""hypertension, dyslipidemias, diabetes, and obesity, and smoked more frequently."" Excess BMI and Inflammatory asthma are deeply correlated. BMI continues to be the risk factor that is always active that gets most dismissed.#[removed]"

With giant tech platforms able to act as monopolistic gatekeepers of that data, and acting within the incentive structure of a capitalist economy where all resources are directed to whatever activity returns the highest profits for institutions that already control the capital required to maintain those platform monopolies - this manipulative, unproductive usage of big data was inevitable due to our economic system.          Democratic decision making for the institutions that collect and distribute data is necessary if we ever hope for that data to be used towards a more productive public good. But the Catch-22, is that the legislative bodies required to enforce that democratic decision making process have already been captured by the extreme capital that has been accumulated by tiny private equity cabals who control majority ownership of these big data platforms.#Personally, I don’t think it’s had the impact that I would like.   In America, our politicians love to talk up how democratic we are.  We live in the communication age.  We have the ability to instantly provide feedback on any law on the table.  We don’t really need politicians to vote on our interests.  At minimum we could literally vote on any law and then have the representative vote for the majority of his voter base.  The representative democracy is outdated.  It enables corruption.   If everyone had a vote, it would be much harder to buy votes that don’t suit the majority.#I remember reading an analysis about disinformation that was saying better educated countries who rated a higher degree of trust in their institutions were more resilient to the spread of disinformation. So for example in places like Scandinavia or Germany there would be relatively unsuccessful disinfo campaigns as compared to USA....I’m curious what your research found.#We're still in the thick of growing pains.  Specifically, we are outgrowing the authoritarian misinformation of the boob tube.  Passive media, especially with rich sensory stimulation like video, encourages consumers to suspend critical thinking and ride along with the narrative of the moment.  Pair that with seven corporate entites (several being the sole property of specific billionaires) controlling *most* of the ""news"" Americans see and hear, and it is a little less mysterious how we've kept allowing a pair of hopelessly corrupt private clubs dominate our civic culture throughout the Reaganomic era.  People know better now.  As that knowledge spreads and deepens, there will be less and less support for bogus partisan narratives.  I mean, they had to put a clown like Donald Trump in the Oval Office just to keep people locked in one more cycle of dystopian lies.  Unless the media rallies a similar level of hate for Joe Biden, there will no longer be any way to shift the blame for mass incarceration, perpetual war, and systematic economic exploitation away from our status quo power structure of ultra-rich insiders driving a completely incoherent and counterproductive war machine in the place where we might instead have a federal government of some sort.#It gave stupid people more power. Popular became more important than reality.#There was a discussion about this, in the context of the Qanon conspiracy theory,  on a recent episode of the Skeptics Guide to the Universe which is worth listening to. The host's (Steven Novella) conclusion is that it has been both good and bad. Good in the sense that we have access to much more information and that the gatekeepers to information have largely been bypassed. But bad for people who lack critical thinking skills and media literacy. https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcasts/episode-785#[removed]#Interesting. I'm inclined to agree with you that our digital technology isn't being leveraged to the extent that it could be. We've never been more interconnected  not just nationally, but globally. Never before have large institutions been able to quickly collect and evaluate public opinion - just look at how quickly media companies respond to consumer criticism of marketing material - e.g. Sonic's redesign, or EA's response to the Star Wars controversy. So why then are politics not using this technology to better inform the democratic process? It seems that, if anything, the internet has exacerbated things. In the United States, people are more polarized than ever, and meaningful dialogue seems like a gargantuan task. People stick to their echo chambers, conspiracy theories, and anti-intellectualism run rampant, and in an age where we have access to more information than ever before, people are more confidently misinformed than ever.#Interesting, I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for sharing.#To clarify: I'm not specifically looking for examples of how Big Data has influenced democracy that I have not already covered. I'm trying to initiate discussion around the idea, to see what others think and have an exchange of ideas. It doesn't matter if people cover something I already wrote.#The fact that there is so much information is part of the problem. Who decides what information gets shared and where? Who is assessing the veracity of each and every claim?Why should democracy be so reactive, like EA responding to game criticism? Instability and reactivity are not desirable qualities in government. Plus, you need to address the fact that information from big data goes both ways, people get more information, but so do the architects of society. It is a lot easier to manipulate than espouse truth and reason on the internet. A live experiment has been running for decades and the result is that people seek out that which confirms what they already believe. That is why we aren’t having philosophical discussions about the nature of human governance and where society should move forward and instead we argue whether a mask is going to make you suffocate and infringe on your rights. THAT is the legacy of the “Information Age.”#> Why should democracy be so reactive, like EA responding to game criticism? Instability and reactivity are not desirable qualities in government. This is a very good point. However, I would argue that, just as we now produce more data than ever, we also have more tools to decipher that data. Democracy espouses itself as ""the will of the people"", and knowledge is no longer the domain of the academic.  You would theoretically expect mankind to collectively better informed than ever before, better able to discern among ourselves what is the most beneficial path forward for all, and be better equipped to rapidly act on that knowledge. But, as you said, it appears that what has actually happened is that that data is being used to control, from the top down. Rather than citizens collectively steering the ship of government, government (and other institutions) are using that data to deceive, polarise, and control citizens. It's cynical, and I would like to remain optimistic, but I, unfortunately, fear that you're probably correct.#> we also have more tools to decipher that dataThis is true, but the number of people with a good understanding of those tools and how to decipher data is much smaller than people tend to think it is.One of the general issues I think we internet folks don't take into account is that even in the most internet connected societies, the majority of people are not engaged online in a meaningful way.  Places like Reddit for example have a disproportionate number of lurkers to commenters, and even fewer posters.  [Most sites follow the 1% rule.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29)  So the information and platform for discussion and debate exists its not as utilized as it would need to be for what your talking about.  Further, the echo chambers are so captivating so that minority of people online willing to participate has an even smaller group willing to participate in cross ideological dialogue.So the technology itself is capable of what your talking about, we are much further from it being a practical reality than many online people tend to think.  I think twitter has the most engagement of any platform, and in the US they have 48 million users, with roughly 40% active on any given day, so that is 9 to 10 million people actually using it on any given day.  To utilize the technology like your talking about without a huge paradigm shift in peoples behavior, would leave a very small group actually participating, a group that right now is very likely much smaller than those who are participating in our representative democracy, representatives and senators are flooded with messages from their direct constituents, and primaries draw huge numbers of people in participating in the selection of candidates.  Not to mention the federal items are mirrored in most states at state and local levels."

newzealand;hwzaw5;1595586026.0;/r/newzealand/comments/hwzaw5/remain_for_year_13_or_head_straight_for_uni/;Remain for Year 13 or head straight for uni?;Hi New ZealandI am a British Jaffa. I am in Year 12, and doing Cambridge AS Levels and an A Level. This basically allows me to gain University Entrance this year AND I can also satisfy the pre-requisites for all first-year papers as well in my degree of BE(Hons) specialising in Software Engineering.My family and I are however finding it extremely hard to decide whether for me to go straight to UC next year to start my 4-year BE(Hons), or to remain in Year 13 to complete my Cambridge A-Levels and a Maths paper through STAR which would then allow me to go straight to Year 2 BE(Hons). I have talked to UC and they introduced me to this discretion - there seems to be no info about it on their website.As a British, I am an international student in NZ so either way would cost my family the same (around $43k) next year, but if I choose the latter option of remaining in Year 13 I can apply for a one-off scholarship of $15k.I don't want to remain in Year 13 because the problem is the offer to go straight to Year 2 BE(Hons) from Year 13 is not a firm promise from UC so there is uncertainty here. If I remain for Year 13 and then do not get the discretion that means I'll have to delay by one year and pay an additional amount of $43k. Which is huge.But I don't want to leave school either. I have been offered to be, starting from next year, a Peer Support, a House Exec, the Chair of the Student Council Board, and be the UN Youth Ambassador to the School, I also have plans to set up a club at my school that would comprise of enthusiasts in cloud stuff e.g. VPS, hosting, domain, IPv6, Big Data, Azure, Data Science etc. These are really big offers and if they can gain me discretion into Year 2 BE(Hons) I may also be granted a scholarship that could save us a staggering amount of $15k.As a 17-year-old attending uni if I go with the first option, I do expect to really miss lots of social lives but then come Year 2 when I also turn 18 and have three more years to complete, as people from other 3-year degrees would also be. I'll also catch up with first-year friends at the same age as me then who would also graduate at the same time as me.My parents are divided on this issue. Daddy wants me to remain at school while Mum is very strong on her choice for uni. I find myself conflicted. Please note that we do not consider for me to return to Britain.What do you think? How would you personally choose in my case? Are there any of you here who have granted the discretion to enter Year 2 BE(Hons) from UC before??;If I where you I would stick with school and enjoy it well you can. Uni will be there waiting but you can’t go back to school (well you could but that would be a bit weird). Plus Star will give you some of the Uni experience with people your own age. Lots of people do 4 or more years so it’s no big deal other then cost.#Do not go to uni before you can drink, you will be the odd person out. Stay at school. Go at the same age as everyone else.#If you actually think reddit is a good place to ask this question then you definitely need that extra year of school#Stay at school. Get your scholarship. Graduate with your peers. You'll regret everything else.#As someone who works in a tertiary provider with new Engineering students, I highly recommend you use that last year at school to refine your academic capability and those essential high level maths skills.  These maths skills are critical.  Students who don't have them often struggle from the start.  Also, with your other possible Year 13 roles, and as a mum of a 17 yr old in Yr 13 currently and doing those same student leader type roles as you have the chance to, I see the benefit of those on your applications for scholarships, and the skills transference to jobs.  Besides that, they will look frikkin awesome on your CV and LinkedIn.  In the end it is down to you alone, and how prepared you feel about tackling something without that extra year of maturity and capability. I say stay at school.  Money isn't everything but the soft skills alone you will gain from those other roles will help immensely in later life too.#You're 18 and still call him Daddy?#Hi! I've just finished studying civil eng at UC, so feel free to ask me any questions you may have. Regarding your conundrum, I would suggest staying in year 13 and joining uni the following year. As far as a social life goes it'll also help to be near to if not already 18.#I feel a real jafa would know how to spell jafa. Glad you’re doing maths!You can do heaps of extracurricular stuff through universities. You won’t miss too much socially. You’ll still have parties etc. And town isn’t always as cool as people make out. Of course it’s a lot of fun at times but you’ll have the following year. It’ll give you more space to get right into your study too which could give you an advantage over others. It’s not like it’s a whole year anyway, just two semesters. If your family has 43k to spend on you, pay a bit more and go have meetings with people who know what they’re talking about.#Bruh I'm in year 12 this guy makes me feel like I'm in year 9.Real talk tho I'm seeing a lot of replies from both sides of what the best choice is. Ultimately it is your decision at the end of the day but there are some factors you may want to consider and probably already are. One being money as you mentioned, I guess it really depends on how much of a burden you want to be on your parents. Cheapest option being the best if you are concerned about that, although not greatly future proof if going straight into a uni major in which u specifically qualify for.Some great advice my uncle, a college counselor, gave me was to keep your pathway options wide initially then go down specific pathway later. In today's world you can no longer just specialise in one pathway in hopes that will be suffice for the rest of your life. If you're doing solid subjects such as mathematics, literature, enconomic sciences, etc for ncea lecel 3 then I would recommend doing year 13 as these will keep your options open so if one pathway fails you've at least got ncea level 3 qualifications to fall back on as opposed to ncea level 2 which would be a further backtrack. STEM majors are generally reliable as they lead to industries that are at the forefront of technological innovation, which could make jumping striaght to uni worth the risk, but you can never be sure of what the future holds. Better safe than sorry if money is not a major stress.Wish you well on your journeys man.#I did STAR COSC at UC in high school, which I found really useful in university, opened up more courses in my first and subsequent years, and gave me a good introduction to university before I started properly. If you stay in High School, I'd do one. If you're doing computer engineering, maybe consider if you can do the STAR COSC - I'm not sure how it affects the ongoing course structure though, I had friends do STAR COSC with me but I can't remember if they skipped first year or just picked up other fun courses.If it was me, I'd stay in high school, enjoy the year, work hard on extra-curricular and personal projects, and personal development. But equally I can see how you'd want to get into university early, such a personal decision.#>starting from next year, a Peer Support, a House Exec, the Chair of the Student Council Board, and be the UN Youth Ambassador to the School, I also have plans to set up a club at my school that would comprise of enthusiasts in cloud stuff e.g. VPS, hosting, domain, IPv6, Big Data, Azure, Data Science etcBad news: none of that matters#Hey mate, as someone who entered Uni at 17 and graduated UC with a Compsci degree, I recommend sticking it out that last year at school. It sounds like school comes naturally to you, so you should try enjoy the last year high school shenanigans while you can with mates.  I'm sure plenty of scholarships, internships and other subsidies of the the like will be available to you next year as well, if not at UC then other places for sure.  For SENG vs Compsci, there's no real clear cut advantage either or so to speak, once you get that first job, the rest just happens either way (if you do just do Compsci, do a couple non required Software Engineering papers to help instill common software practices into your brain). Definitely recommend getting some out of school programming projects on the go!  If you're a social guy, you want to be 18 to enjoy the O' week to it's fullest, there's nothing like that first few weeks of madness meeting people and going out to events and having drinks, you don't want to miss it because of your age.  All the best.#Stay in school and finish it.If you fuck uni up (which you most likely will because it's 1000x harder than high school) then you won't be able to come back to high and do well in final year. It will look like you dropped out and failed uni which looks horrible.Just stay and finish year 13 and focus on studies.You'll also hate uni being the younger one. You'll be isolated due to your age and you'll hate it anyway. Resulting in worse grades.Just don't#I would say staying for y13 not worth it, if you skip y13, then you spend a year less in education, ultimately it will save you 43k if I read correctly.I went to uni after Y12 and everything worked fine, and ultimately I would choose that again.#Don't stay in school. Go to uni.#Appreciate the comment! Thanks for pointing out the fact that I can't go back to school once left :) But when you attend Open Day and learn more about uni life high school started to sort of feel too naive, hence I do have a temptation to go to uni now which should be assessed carefully#I hear much about this. UC students who I chat with say this to me. What is so big about social aspects? Do you require ID at virtually every club? Do you have lots of beers at uni or some sort of that?#Why do you say that? reddit is probably the best place to ask this since there's likely a whole bunch of people who did this lurking here.#This is just one of the places where I am asking so no worries! But thanks for reading and commenting.#Thanks!#Hi! Thank you soo much for your reply and it is really much appreciated. Gives me a good view from the perspective of people who know Engineering students best.   These sorts of leadership experiences are quite valuable I think. I do put them in my CV when I apply for jobs and on my LinkedIn, and yes, they look frikkin good and makes applying for part-time positions a much easier task, hence the reason why I still want to remain at school. I'm also very interested in politics and youth politics (as the comments below) which makes it a very hard decision, but I don't see me becoming a politician. My mum argues it's not going to help much once you get industrial experiences.#> as a mum of a 17 yr old in Yr 13 currently and doing those same student leader type roles as you have the chance to, I see the benefit of those on your applications for scholarships, and the skills transference to jobs. **Besides that, they will look frikkin awesome on your CV and LinkedIn**.I hate to break it to you but nobody really cares about this stuff unless you're going to med school or setting yourself up in youth politics.#[deleted]#I'm 16, but I thought that was normal??#Hi! Wow, thank you for the offer. Much appreciated, shall we move to messaging or would you like to remain here?? Cheers again#Jafa - Just Another F Aucklander  Jaffa - Just Another F wit From AucklandThank you very much for your comment which gives me good views of that I could do things at uni as a substitution for high school extra-curricular activities.#Thank you for your generous words and the advice you've given me which is much appreciated. In some sense 'journey' can also be considered literary as well - We moved around the UK, then we moved to Australia because pneumonia threatened me so then I was advised to live in warmer climates (which is why I couldn't return to the UK), then my parents moved back to England. I moved to Wellington before settling in Auckland.  I am now quite decisive that I would stick with Software Engineering - though I have some affection for these cloud, VPS and SQL things. It was a bit hard to consider between SoftEng and CompSci initially actually, but we reached a choice and the ticket goes to SoftEng. Software Engineering at UC comprises also a big component of compsci contents. Then the choice for uni - Auckland or UC or Melbourne? We went for UC in the end, though sometimes I thought to myself, no offence here, NZ was a bit naive, but I fell in love with this country and have no intention of leaving.  Now is the final remaining bit of whether to skip Year 13 or the first year of uni.  I agree with you - there were changes to our decisions one of which was reversed and then re-reversed so staying for one more year would allow me to think more about these.  And that today's society also values multi-disciplinaries. Especially in NZ, not so much in Britain, my parents have never changed their jobs but most adults I know here in NZ changed their jobs at least once. I do think I need to take that into account.  Again, thanks for the comment!#I am doing Cambridge A Level Computer Science already which I think is somewhat at the same standard as the two first year COSC courses. The only thing is that the language introduced is [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) / Python rather than C# or Java usually taught in uni papers.Also, I don't think COSC papers are available for distance learning from Auckland! But hey thank you for the recommendation and I consider it highly#Absolute bollocks.  Don't underestimate that stuff on a scholarship application and CV for a first job.#Except socially.#They do, in a way. It shows you have a life and that you’ve picked up extra shit and valuable skills#This is my mum's point. She thinks none of that matters once you get the industrial experience. But when I look at people like Jacinda, Nikki Kaye, Chris Hipkins (I'm obsessed with politics) they were all head prefects, head girls/boys, and I'm sure many other past and present MPs and successful people held these roles back in high school as well.#Thank you very much! I consider this comment very highly. There was a time when we did find it hard to consider between CompSci and SoftEng but then went for SoftEng - there is accreditation in case I need to move somewhere else, also the 800-hour work component. But I do fall in love with these sorts of cloud engineering/network engineering/SQL thing as well so I do plan to take additional papers at uni.I'm a social person so yeah it's worth to consider staying at high school for another year to enjoy O' week to its fullest.#Yup, but I can also choose to remain in Year 13 and pray that I get discretion to year 2 BE(Hons) accompanied by a $15k scholarship which makes it really hard to consider. UC does not promise this however, I emailed a liaison officer and they said this providing I can gain A in Physics at A-Level and pass their Maths199 star paper, but when I forced them to confirm explicitly they started to sort of say 'you'll need to apply to the Faculty Head through the EOI form who will then judge your application.'#Thanks for your comment. What do you think are the benefits of going to uni now?#Your uni life will be severely compromised going when you're 17. If you think Canterbury uni are going to skip their opportunity to take you on you are mistaken. They need numbers big time. They'll be there in a year. As you can see here, everyone's advice is stay in school. Don't take it for granted. Work hard this upcoming year. But make sure every day at 4pm take a deep breath. Forget about tomorrow. Think about it at 6am#I’m a student at UC, and it’s great. But trust me you’re not going to miss anything by waiting an extra year. In fact you will probably miss more if you don’t. All your friends will be from your year group. And good luck making friends with people your own ages when they come in the year after. You won’t be in any of the same classes and it doesn’t really work out like you think it would. You also wouldn’t be able to do much, everything official is 18+ so even if you don’t plan on drinking you still need ID. In high school you have friends, some of them you want see once you leave for Uni. And by the sounds of it you have lots of great opportunities there, like your club. Take the time to enjoy what high school has to offer next year and Uni will be there waiting. You won’t regret it.#[deleted]#No problem. Good luck for the future. Sounds like it will be a good one.#And that is what mine is precisely doing.  As for those soft skills which are sometimes sadly lacking in new employees, they are vitally important to pick up at an early age.#I'm personally very interested in Politics in fact hence all these things, but I don't see my future becoming a politician. At least not until 50. You can be a New Zealander in the House of Commons, a NZer can vote in the UK, but no Brits don't enjoy the same rights in NZ.#Med school gives zero fucks, in NZ it's almost entirely decided by your grades in your first year pre-med papers at uni and an interview.#It's a dialect thing.In NZ English, 'Daddy' and 'Mummy' are seen as words for only a child, which are no longer cool/right to use after the age of \~8 years old, they then turn into Mum and Dad.#It’s a Brit thing.#I think messaging might be easier, so hit me up whenever suits ya#To be fair, it’s not those roles that got them where they are, but the fact that they were the type of people who could get/hold those roles... but ‘success’ (however you define it) breeds success. It’s nice to get some wins like that on the board while you’re young, and can help a little with getting the next step up - like that scholarship as you mentioned, or bolstering your CV for an internship (although what you do during your time at uni matters a bit more).#It helps for your first part-time job, scholarships for uni (but unlikely to be scholarships for you if you’re international) BUT there’s no reason you can’t find similar leadership roles at university, and I’d argue that uni-level leadership roles look way better than high school ones. I did tons of that through high school, uni and continue to do so as an adult, the only ones on my CV now are adult ones. Debate team, model UN, toastmasters, any political party youth arm, different activist groups like 350 Aotearoa or Amnesty International on campus, there’s a hundred ways to get leadership roles at uni.But, 16 is quite young, and there’s likely a maturity gap between you and everyone else that may make it socially very difficult.#Yes exactly.  She's right, but you haven't got that industrial shit yet.  Don't let the saddos stuck in dreary job ruts on this forum with their 'ain't worth shit' attitudes decide for you.  How about going off to talk to some people in the industry you want to get into and seeing what they say?#No, what I mean is that I don't really understand genuine in what way (how) I am going to miss social lives?

But hey thanks for the comment! Gives me a good insight into uni.   I realised that I've been underestimating these societies at uni well and truly. Do you require ID to become club members of such clubs?#Hey the point of transferable skills is a good point, thanks for it, I've never considered skills from these to be transferable seriously, though I do put them on my CV and I suspect it has helped in getting jobs#List of UC clubs here: https://ucsa.org.nz/clubs/find-a-club/ some will be more active than others.Depends on the club, whether you need student ID. Technically they need a certain amount of current students to be a official club, but some are open to others (usually the more informal ones) while others will require it (I would suspect ENSOC falls into this category)

I've talked to a few places recently and when I give my range, I'll basically be laughed at (200-215).

I have a BS in Economics, an MBA and 2.5 years at a retail bank branch. I also have Social Anxiety and OCD and the work conditions are absolutely downright horrible here which are making my mental health horribly worse. The 12 hr work and 14 hr days with commute, 15 minute lunch, huge workload, grunt clerical work, rude customers, constant customer service, multitasking, huge sales pressures are the main problem. I can't take it anymore, I feel like I would suddenly die with my head exploding. I have done quite a bit of research, reading career articles, asking on forums and what not and I am ready to aim for a jump in Business Intelligence. Now the issue is that I can't find a list of skills that is needed in a Business Intelligence occupation. I read the book, Getting a Big Data Job for Dummies, they had a list for Business Analysis jobs which included the following skills: SQL/Database Programming,Financial Analysis, Predictive Analytics Models, What-if Analysis,Business Writing,Presentation Skills, Mad Excel Skills,Visualization Tools (of any kind). But I couldn't find any list for Business Intelligence jobs in the book. So can someone please tell me what are the skills that I need to learn in order to get into a Business Intelligence occupation? Also please suggest a free online course with free certificates on the fundamentals of Business Intelligence. We need a passport and credit card here in order to buy anything from abroad which I don't have at the moment. PS: I know times are tough but I am being let go in 15 days from my current job because of not bringing in enough sales. So I need to learn the high priority skills of BI as quickly as I can and start applying. I need to prioritize to learn the most important skills first since I am short on time.;I'd say at a junior level you'd want a basic understanding of data warehousing methodologies such as the Kimball methodology, fundamental skills in T-SQL, a fundamental understanding of database architecture and some experience using a visualisation tool such as SSRS or Power BI/Tableau. SSRS is pretty much everywhere and the other two are very popular.As for soft skills excel and stakeholder management will be key.I had the above mentioned skills when I got my first BI job and developed them to an advanced level over time. Having an understanding of other programming languages such as R, Python and C# will be a bonus but not absolutely necessary.Good luck.#You basically have the credentials already between your Econ degree and MBA, I would say brush up on your Excel, consider learning SQL and either Python or R. that's really the only general advice i can give. Everything else would depend entirely on what kind of business analytics you were looking to do. The three biggest fields as far as plentiful job opportunities are, Finance, Marketing, and Supply Chain Management. I have no advice for Finance analytics. cause fuck finance. we both have suffered enough. (former WF personal Banker)Marketing is a little less lucrative but its what i picked and i'm pretty happy with my decision. If you want marketing analytics, pick up salesforce and google analytics and Ads certs maybe? the analysis i've done so far has been fairly basic. If you took any advanced statistics or Calc. then most of this job will feel like child's play until you get your company to a more advanced place yourself.Supply chain management was what i tried first. their first project was all about demand forecasting and planning where their products should be and when for most effective sales. It was an interesting time and the work was complex enough to keep me engaged for awhile but eventually once that was all done they ran out of use for me so i bailed. hope this helpsAlso, HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend you look over your resume and make sure that is in tip top shape. no spelling or grammatical errors, not just a wall of black and white text.I say this because when i got my first analytics job, my manager told me they picked me over someone who had two master's degrees because he had a spelling error in his resume. I have one BS finance degree. so spelling mistakes count for two Master's degrees to some people out there.#I’d recommend learning a data visualization tool(Tableau my preference or Power BI) and SQL concepts. That should get you in at an BI analyst level.Lot more things to do in BI so upon cracking in see what else is interesting to you, but make sure conceptually you have a clear understanding of things and then you’d be able to choose what you desire.#SQL, excel(DAX and power pivot), Power BI or tableau#Bare minimum? SQL and Excel#Know one data viz tool, SQL, database principles, data warehousing concepts, analytics concepts#I think it will depend on what tools the company you are applying to uses. I would focus on selling real life experience you have using these tools or if you don't have much, find some problems in your current job that could be fixed with reporting or automation. I think having this type of practical exposure is important. See if you can build a report for someone who needs it. Find some online projects people need help with.But yeah, generally excel, SQL, data visualization tool should be enough for a lot of jobs if you can speak to them well. I think there are a lot of entry level 'data analyst' jobs that aren't super complicated but will help you gain some good experience.#As for free courses, Udemy has some of those#>This [BI career guide](https://www.simplilearn.com/business-intelligence-career-guide-pdf?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=crosspromo&utm_campaign=pm_july_ev) might help you. it covers the skills required, career opportunities available and the ideal learning path needed to propel a career in the thriving and lucrative field of Business Intelligence.

Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF), primary keys, constraints, cardinality relationships, and mathematical theory behind databases.You don't really have to know the relational algebra. Just know the basics of the science behind normalization. Having a good understanding of normalization will help with Kimball, which is very definition heavy, and may be hard to start without prior database knowledge.There's a guy online, he's Australian or from New Zealand, who does a great 3 part introduction to Kimball methods. I recommend starting there before the text.Brent Ozar has a free course, I think it's called Level up, that will help with how the SQL Server engine works. It will help you with SQL and database design as well.#Depends on the job, apply and see what they say. Industry experience helps if your planning to stay in the same industry.

Professors;ho0z1a;1594291624.0;/r/Professors/comments/ho0z1a/rant_about_department_chair_trying_to_get_free/;"Rant about department chair trying to get ""free work""";"# Summary:Department chair has sent me and other NTT a task that is well outside the scope of our current responsibilities  and expects free work to be done on this.  I wish to tell him to sod off in the most polite or PC manner.# Detailed account:So I am a Mechanical Engineering NTT at an R2 STEM university that has aspirations to be R1.  Last year, my department had purchased a ""large dataset"" of engineering data (CAD data like point cloud, FEA data like mesh densities...) and to leverage it in our undergraduate courses.  It is a good idea in theory.  However, this dataset is what one could consider having tendencies of ""big data"".  This is certainly a buzzword of immense gravity in computing now.  Now, the department chair sent me and a few other NTT 2 emails in the space of 4 hours asking us to evaluate this dataset and provide him with a report (testimonial or white-paper really on marketability) on how this data can be used in our undergraduate curriculum.  This pisses me off for the following reasons:  1. We recently received an across the board paycut.    2. The administration has been treating me as being completely dispensable with respect to COVID teaching responsibilities  3. The task the chair has asked us NTT to do is what you would ask a full time data scientist to do.  The last I checked, these DS with PhDs can get paid in the vicinity of $120k-$140k a year.  I have some DS experience and I estimate that the task we have been asked to complete can take in the neighborhood of ~1 week and WE ARE ASKED TO DO THIS WITHOUT BEING COMPENSATED?!Items 1. and 2. do not really ingratiate the department or the university with me and 3. is just downright explotation.I am sick and tired of this voluntary/*pro bono* work.  How should I tell the chair to fuck off, but politely.## I was hoping to write him saying:  - ""the magnitude of this uncompensated task that is not in my teaching assignment, that you have assigned will consume ~1 week or more.  I do not have the time to do this at the moment"". - ""Data scientists are paid in the neighborhood of $120k-$140k to evaluate large datasets for marketable value.  I wish to be compensated at these rates and be provided 2% of the revenue from future enrollment as a result of leveraging this data.""**Have you been exploited like this and if so, how did you say ""enough is enough""**Also... do you know of any remote computing/math modeling jobs that are open right now?... asking for a friend...Love and kisses,ZaphodEdit: RE contract -- I am on a 9th month contract.  I get paid in the summer on a course-by-course basis only if I agree to teaching courses then.";"[deleted]#The pay disparity argument is a nonstarter. We have people in my department that earn 25 and *50*k more than me  we do the same service.Well, actually the people paid more do less, but that's a problem with how we assess service.What *would* be a reasonable argument is whether or not you are currently on-contract and how much service you are expected to perform (here, non-permenant NTTs are expected to do minimal or no service  permanent or 5+ year contract NTTs are expected to do a lot).That sounds like undergrad curriculum committee work - is committee work part of your appointment? If not, I'd try pointing to my appointment duty percentages (0% service, say). If that doesn't work, HR is probably the next step, but of course doing that might make him cranky, which sucks.#I went through the same dilemma. I'm NTT and my department also treats me like persona non grata. This summer a lot of the course monitors are redoing the lower-level courses and they're asking the non-tenure-track faculty who will be teaching these lower level courses, to work on them. My solution was to stop reading my University emails and act like I didn't read the ones I saw. I didn't respond to them and if anybody says anything to me I'll say, ""*I was on vacation so why would I read my work email?*"". If you do feel the need to respond, you can simply write a one-line sentence and say that sounds really interesting however you're on vacation right now visiting your parents/mistress/guru and you're be unable to do it. My University acts like they're the boss of us and that we're plugged in 24/7 to them. So I deliberately unplugged because I need to separate my work life from my personal life and I don't feel they have the right to intrude on my own personal time.But as others have suggested, look at your contract. I know at my institution non-tenure-track faculty only have an appointment from August to May. If that's the case you're under no obligation to do anything nor do you have to explain yourself to anyone.#Do you have a contract?  A union?  At my university, the NTT faculty could and would straight up decline this uncompensated task.#Sorry for the situation. It is typical administration nonsense they are asking you to do but don’t let it bother you. Make lemonade out of lemons. Provide a small, preliminary testimonial about the “prospects and potential opportunities” of the data after your cursory evaluation, not exceeding a page. This way it is unlikely they will give compensation to anyone else to do the work (eg eager-beaver new TT faculty willing to do anything). As faculty, I can write a page about anything even while sitting on my morning throne.Then indicate that you will need either money or at least a course release and a student to be able to fully evaluate the data set. If you get it, the final “report” should be in paper format that you can, of course, publish as first author.Shake it off, this is typical cheap academia tactics...#[deleted]#RE contract -- I am on a 9th month contract.  I get paid in the summer on a course-by-course basis only if I agree to teaching courses then.#Undergrad curriculum is part of my committee work but doesn't  appear in my contract language.Also, I'm not on contract in the summer.#No contract in the summer. Union was disbanded in the 90s .#thank you for the advice.  I agree with you on your approach. Had it been the first time I had been asked to do something like this, maybe I would have.   It is just that I have done enough ""free labor"" data analysis for the department and do not want to anymore.  It is ridiculous.  Maybe the chair does not even know or fully appreciate the magnitude of the task.#Wow, this is a really good email.  With your permission, I would like to use this as a template for future.>I'm afraid I can't be more helpful in your case as you are being asked to do highly specialized technical work. I agree with a lot of the feedback being provided here. You always have to balance your needs with your future job prospects and ""how much trouble"" you will get yourself in. If you're actually indispensable and know that your contract is pretty secure for the next term, then you can more comfortably say no. If not, then you're taking a bit of a chance.At this point, I am ok with getting into trouble for refusing to do something during my ""off months"" (I have a rolling contract with salaried responsibilities for 9 months in an academic year).#I wouldn't do anything over the summer without a stipend  though that would be tempered by contract renewal stuff.You could tell them you're busy doing other work for the summer since your contract is whatever it is (9 month, etc), and won't be able to get to that until committee work begins in August.#Ahh.  Well, I assume you are paid by the class, which gives you a solid basis for declining the task.  I would just let him know that although you are not compensated to do that kind of task, you are happy to do it at you consulting rate of $100/ hour.#>  It is just that I have done enough ""free labor"" data analysis for the department and do not want to anymore. It is ridiculous. You might suggest that it would be better for your chair to contact your statistics department and see if there are any potential collaborators in that department who might be interested in research about integrating real-world data analysis into the curriculum#[deleted]#Actually, at my university Adjuncts are also (up to) full-time and NTT, but not expected (or ever asked) to do any administrative work.#Good point. At my Uni NTT’s contracts specifically stipulate that we dedicate 20% of our time to service.#RE contract -- I am on a 9th month contract.  I get paid in the summer on a course-by-course basis only if I agree to teaching courses then.#[deleted]#Our NTTs are supposed to be 50-50, which is nuts. But they do.end up with a lot more service than NTT at other schools.#Yes, that is explicitly what I said, but the larger point remains valid — regardless of how they are paid, teaching staff are paid to teach, not do administrative work.#Not at my institution. Our NTTs do a lot of service.#In my department's convoluted setting service is ""expected"" but does not count towards promotions."

If you don't already know this stuff you should definitely take them. Ideally before you do any of the more advanced machine learning courses.* Statistical Theory / Statistical Theory and Methods* Statistical Learning* Linear Regression and Robustness* Generalised Linear Models / Generalised Linear and Additive ModelsOnce you know the basics, I would take these courses:* Machine Learning* Information Visualization* Data Mining and Text Analytics* Forecasting and Advanced Business Analytics* Time SeriesI'd also choose one of the decision making / decision science courses. Everything else depends on your interests. Bayesian statistics or multivariate analysis might be interesting. If you have a particular interest for the field, the courses on transport or retail might suit you. Graph theory is also very interesting but has very few applications in most companies.#Why is there Statistical Theory andStatistical THeory and Methods?I also find it odd there's Distributed Systems and Big Data Systems, as most Big Data Systems are distributed anyway. And then there's BIg Data and Consumer Analytics. Seems like a lot of courses ahve some overlap#I think its a bit too complex for the internet to guide... try to choose ones where the course looks good quality and will cover lots of ground, and that dont overlap with each other, and dont overlap with what you already know, and dont have too much that you know you dont care about.#I see options like Image Analysis or Transport Data Science.  Options like that are great if those interest you. And are a waste of time of you ultimately don't want to do that work. Is there a field that you want to work in?  Healthcare? Transportation?  Advertising (lame but has a lot of opportunities because of the money behind it).Is there a types of projects you want to work on?  Software / coding?   Technical stats and rigor?  Looking for business opportunities in data (analysis)?If you don't know and are unable.  A good idea then is to ask classmates: who are the best teachers and best classes. Perhaps one of them will inspire a direction.#Post in the entering and transitioning thread please#If you actually wanna work as a DS and not as an analyst, you have to start from basics.Have u had enough calculus? Cause machine learning at its core relies on vectors, matrix and derivatives.So I would learn stuff as follows.1) Calculus 1-32) Linear Algebra 3) Probability and Statistics 4) Python5) Data Structure and algorithm.These are must if end goal is data scientist. Then you can take Stat methods and ML and all advanced classes.#Thank you so much, that was really helpful!If I may ask, what do you think of the programming modules and the Big Data and Consumer Analytics one?I assumed that programming modules would be essential, and the Consumer Analytics can be useful in most B2C companies.#Advertising would be great because of my background in Business Mgt and Marketing, and there isn't a specific type of project I want to work on - anything that's highly sought after in the market would work for me  bonus points if it's related to advertising/marketing!Thanks for your help!#If you don't know how to program yet, you should definitely learn that. But I don't think any of the courses are well suited for that. Try learning some Python, SQL and maybe R on your own. I used the website Codecademy when I was a student to learn the basics. After that you can do some little projects to get the hang out of it.Maybe the practical programming could be useful, but you'd have to check the course description for more details. The other programming courses that you listed are too specific and in my opinion only make sense for ML Engineers but not for Data Scientists.Yes, I didn't see that one. Big Data and Consumer Analytics would be a good addition. However, in my opinion the things you learn in these business courses are often just common sense. I would always take a statistics / ML foundations course over a business course.#YES most of the business modules I took in my BA/MSc were underwhelming because of that.I might sound naive but I genuinely expected a MSc Data Science course to teach me at least how to use Python.Thanks again for your insights!#You’ll thank yourself if you take some time to build some simple projects to teach you about syntax, control flow, loops, etc.

USIBC's choice of this year's Ideas Summit -‘Building a Better Future' is also very very relevant.**Friends,**We all agree that the world is in need for a better future. And, it is all of us who have to collectively give shape to the future. I firmly believe that our approach to the future must primarily be a more human- centric one. Our growth agenda must place the poor and vulnerable at the core. ‘Ease of Living’ is as important as ‘Ease of Business’.**Friends,**Recent experience has taught us that the global economy has been too focused on efficiency and optimization. Efficiency is a good thing. But, on the way, we forgot to focus on something equally important. That is resilience against external shocks. It has taken a global pandemic to remind us how important resilience is.**Friends,**Global economic resilience can be achieved by stronger domestic economic capacities. This means improved domestic capacity for manufacturing, restoring the health of the financial system and diversification of international trade.**Friends,**India is contributing towards a prosperous and resilient world through the clarion call of an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. And, for that, we await your partnership!**Friends,**Today, there is global optimism towards India. This is because India offers a perfect combination of openness, opportunities and options. Let me elaborate. India celebrates openness in people and in governance. Open minds make open markets. Open markets lead to greater prosperity. These are principles on which both India and the USA agree.**Friends,**During the last six years, we have made many efforts to make our economy more open and reform oriented. Reforms have ensured increased ‘Competitiveness’, enhanced ‘Transparency’, expanded ‘Digitization’, greater ‘Innovation’ and more ‘Policy stability’.**Friends,**India is emerging as a land of opportunities. Let me give you one example of the tech sector. Recently, an interesting report came out in India. It said for the first time ever, there are more rural internet users than even urban internet users. Imagine the scale! There are about half a billion active internet users in India now. Half a billion connected people. Does this sound huge to you? Hold your breath. Because, there are over half a billion more people who are being connected. Opportunities in technology also include opportunities in the frontier technologies of 5G, Big data analytics, Quantum computing, Block-chain and Internet of things.**Friends,**The options to invest in India are extensive. India invites you to invest in the hard-work of our farmers. India has done historic reforms in the agriculture sector recently. There are investment opportunities in: Agricultural inputs and machinery, Agriculture supply chain management, Ready-to-eat items, Fisheries and Organic produce. India's food processing sector is expected to be worth over half a trillion dollars by 2025. To grow more streams of revenue, the best time to tap investment opportunities in Indian agriculture sector is now!India invites you to invest in healthcare. The Healthcare sector in India is growing faster than 22 percent every year. Our companies are also progressing in production of medical-technology, tele-medicine and diagnostics. India and the US have already built a robust partnership in the Pharma sector. To achieve scale and speed, now is the best time to expand your investment in Indian health-care sector!India invites you to invest in energy. As India evolves into a gas-based economy, there will be big investment opportunities for US companies. There are also big opportunities in the clean energy sector. To generate more power for your investment, this is the best time to enter the Indian power sector!India invites you to invest in infrastructure. Our nation is witnessing the largest infrastructure creation drive in our history. Come, be a partner in building housing for millions, or building roads, highways and ports in our nation.Civil Aviation is another area of great potential growth. The number of Air passengers are expected to more than double within next 8 years. The top private Indian airlines plan to include over a thousand new aircraft over the coming decade. This is a huge opportunity for any investor who chooses to set up manufacturing facilities in India, which can become a base for supplying regional markets. A similar case is obvious for setting up Maintenance Repair and Operations facilities. To give flight to your aviation targets, this is an ideal time to invest in the Indian aviation sector.India invites you to invest in defense and space. We are raising the FDI cap for investment in defense sector to 74 percent. India has established two defense corridors to encourage production of defense equipment and platforms. We offer special incentives for private and foreign investors. A few weeks ago, we cleared path-breaking reforms in the space sector. Come, be a part of these upcoming sectors.India invites you to invest in finance and insurance. India has raised FDI cap for investment in insurance to 49 percent. Now 100 percent FDI is permitted for investment in insurance intermediaries. The insurance market in India is growing at a rate of more than 12 percent and is expected to grow to 250 billion dollars by 2025. With the success of Ayushman Bharat, our health assurance scheme, PM Fasal Bima Yojna, our crop insurance scheme and Jan Suraksha or social security schemes, the government has laid the ground for quick adoption and acceptance of insurance products. There are large untapped opportunities for increasing insurance cover in health, agriculture, business and life insurance. To generate long term and assured revenues, the Indian insurance sector is one of the best investment options right now!I have given you a few options and that too without any consultancy fees.**Friends,**When the markets are open, when the opportunity is high and the options are many, can optimism be far behind! You can see the optimism when India rises in key business ratings. Particularly the Ease of Doing Business ratings of the World Bank.Investment is the best show of confidence. Every year, we are reaching record highs in FDI. Each year is significantly higher than the earlier one. FDI inflows in India in 2019-20 were 74 billion dollars. This is an increase of 20 percent from the year before that. Friends in USIBC inform that ‘pledged investment’ from the US has already crossed 40 billion dollars this year! Also see what has happened even during the ongoing pandemic. In the middle of COVID, India has attracted foreign investment of more than 20 billion dollars between April and July 2020!But, India offers many more opportunities. We have what is needed to power the global economic recovery.**Friends,**The rise of India means: a rise in trade opportunities with a nation that you can trust, a rise in global integration with increasing openness, a rise in your competitiveness with access to a market which offers scale. And a rise your returns on investment with the availability of skilled human resources.**Friends,**For this vision, there are few better partners than the United States of America. India and the USA are two vibrant democracies with shared values. We are natural partners. The US-India friendship has scaled many heights in the past. Now it is time our partnership plays an important role in helping the world bounce back faster after the pandemic. American investors often look out for the perfect timing to enter a sector or a country. To them, I would like to say: there has never been a better time to invest in India!I once again thank the USIBC leadership for their commitment to advancing India-US economic partnership. May the USIBC keep scaling new heights!**May the India-America friendship grow further!****Namaste!****Thank you!**&#x200B **Key points from the Speech :** **1) Addressing the Summit**, PM Narendra Modi said it has taken a global pandemic to remind us how important resilience is. PM Modi said the recent experience has taught the world that the global economy has been too focused on efficiency and optimisation. ""Efficiency is a good thing. But, on the way, we forgot to focus on something equally important. That is resilience against external shocks,"" PM Modi said.  **2) PM Modi said**, today there is global optimism towards India because ""India offers a perfect combination of openness, opportunities and options"". ""Let me elaborate. India celebrates openness in people and in governance. During the last six years, we have made many efforts to make our economy more open and reform oriented. Reforms have ensured increased competitiveness, enhanced transparency, expanded digitisation, greater innovation and more policy stability,"" he said.**3) PM Modi said** today India is an emerging destination of new opportunities. ""Let me give you one example of the tech sector. Recently, an interesting report came out in India. It said for the first time ever, there are more rural internet users than even urban internet users. Opportunities in technology also include opportunities in the frontier technologies of 5G, Big data analytics, Quantum computing, Block-chain and Internet of things,"" he said. **4) Speaking about the** opportunities in the agriculture sector, PM Modi said the country has recently carried out ""historic reforms"" in this sector. ""There are investment opportunities in agricultural inputs and machinery, agriculture supply chain management, ready-to-eat items, fisheries and organic produce,"" he said.**5) Stressing upon the** India-US ties, PM Modi said there are few better partners than the United States of America and India. ""India and the US are two vibrant democracies with shared values. We are natural partners. The rise of India means a rise in trade opportunities with a nation that you can trust, a rise in global integration with increasing openness, a rise in your competitiveness with access to a market which offers scale,"" the Prime Minister said in his address to the India Ideas Summit 2020.";Source :  [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/full-text-pm-modis-address-at-india-ideas-summit/articleshow/77113508.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/full-text-pm-modis-address-at-india-ideas-summit/articleshow/77113508.cms)#>There are about half a billion active internet users in India now.

Epstein;hoakch;1594326198.0;/r/Epstein/comments/hoakch/chiliad_christine_gs_sister_maxwells_data_mining/;Chiliad - Christine (G's sister) Maxwell's data mining company;"TL DR - Ghislaine Maxwell's sister, Christine Maxwell, owns a big data company called Chiliad. It looks like the company worked hand in hand with the FBI and ""other agencies in the 'intelligence world'"" to create a massive database of people's information. I'm curious as to how this might have related to Epstein, and maybe even the maxwellh!ll account on reddit. Even though maxwellh!ll is definitely a reach, I think it's important to figure out what exactly Chiliad is/was doing and how Epstein may have played a role.I haven't seen much talk on this sub about Chiliad, but I thought it was interesting that Ghislaine's sister, Christine, owns/runs this company focused on big data and analytics. It's really hard to find recent information about the company, but I found a couple articles on it:* [Chiliad Simplifies Big Data Search](https://www.informationweek.com/software/chiliad-simplifies-big-data-search/d/d-id/1106722) \- The first couple sentences in this article say that federal intelligence organizations used this company's tools:   * *""Federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies* [*have long used Chiliad's*](http://www.informationweek.com/fbi-shows-off-counterterrorism-database/192500531) *big data analytics platform to uncover information from a variety of data sources and platforms.""** [FBI Shows Off Counterterrorism Database](https://www.informationweek.com/fbi-shows-off-counterterrorism-database/d/d-id/1046592?) \- The previous article had a link to this one. I didn't see Maxwell's name mentioned here, but there were some weird things.   * *""At Tuesday's demo, FBI officials noted that the system can match and cross-link social security numbers and drivers license information and tie disparate* [*data*](http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=data&x=&y=) *together -- all across hundreds of millions of records. Press reports observed that a search of 1,000 names across 50 databases, which took 32,000 hours to run on old search systems, can be performed in less than a half-hour with the Chiliad-built system. ""*   * Why/how does a private company have access to all this information? I can't tell if Chiliad built a generic database tool that the FBI used, or if Chiliad itself was storing all this information. It would be much more interesting if it's the latter case.   * *""McOwen said Chiliad does business with other agencies in the ""intelligence world."" ""*   * I wonder if this includes the Mossad. We know that Epstein was at least somewhat related to them. This sounds like kind of a reach, but Epstein's relationship with Christine wasn't just ""girlfriend's sister"" -- see the next article* [Epstein, Maxwell Sisters, and the FBI's Counterterrorism Database](https://www.mockingbirdpaper.com/content/jeff-epstein-maxwell-sisters-and-fbis-counter-terrorism-database) \- This article links Epstein with Christine Maxwell not just as his girlfriend's sister.   * *""Being Epstein's girlfriend's sister was not her only connection to Epstein. Christine Maxwell also sat on the board of the Sante Fe Institute which is an independent, nonprofit theoretical research institute located in dedicated to the multidisciplinary study of the fundamental principles of complex adaptive systems, including physical, computational, biological, and social systems. Epstein openly donated $25,000 there in 2011""** [Chiliad's Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/ChiliadDiscovery) \- Pretty self explanatory. It looks pretty abandoned. I appreciate the guy who commented ""Mossad"" on every video.&#x200B Anyway, put your tinfoil hats on. What if the maxwellh!ll account is/was operated by Chiliad? It would make sense that a big data company would love to have that much control over reddit  being a mod at r/technology and r/worldpolitics, and also just having a fuckton of karma/reputation on the site meant that this account could genuinely impact the front page on a daily basis. Maybe this is kind of a reach, but if anything new comes out about maxwellh!ll I'm curious to see mentions of Chiliad.And even if the maxwellh!ll account is bullshit, I find it hard to believe that Epstein was not involved with Chiliad in some way. It's a shady company that worked with the FBI and other ""agencies."" That alone has Epstein's name all over it, but it was also owned by Ghislaine's sister?? There has to be something here.&#x200B Let me know what you guys think";I’m just immature, but I think about the Mt. Chiliad mystery from GTA V.

Amsterdam;i1a24p;1596211320.0;/r/Amsterdam/comments/i1a24p/any_software_engineers_willing_to_answer_a_couple/;Any software engineers willing to answer a couple of questions from a future graduate?;Hey everyone,I am an Amsterdam native that is going to start his master next year in Computer Science: Big data engineering. I have a couple of questions and was wondering if anyone has a couple of minutes to spare to answer the questions below?1. What is a reasonable starting salary?2. How did you get your first internship?3. What would you do differently while you're in university to increase your chances of finding a good job?I have some situation-specific questions, but I don't want to bother everyone in this sub with my questions, but I think answers to the questions above might be useful for people in the same situation as me.Thank you guys for your input in advance!;For #3 I would study a specific technology that is in demand or on the rise and work towards getting a certification in it.An obvious examples is AWS but there are hundreds of technologies that are less known but still in high demand. Certifications are more useful in the DevOps world but I'm 100% sure you can find multiple useful certifications specific to Big Data (big data analysis with AWS already sounds stupidly in demand for example).Just remember that the certification itself is not enough for a job, but it is good to clear the minimum requirements on many positions + pass automated screening. What really gets you the job is the knowledge itself so make sure to study well, do several demoable projects on your own, and mention these in your applications.#1. Your salary will increase as you get more productive and knowledgeable. I would focus on improving these with the first developer job.  Consulting or contracting can be a good place to start because you see different projects, companies, etc. 2. Trend is your friend. I started during the dot com boom when it was super easy to get a job developing websites, even without computer science studies. Starting your career with something new means almost everyone is a beginner there.3. Personally I should have graduated sooner rather than take too much extra curriculum. You don't have to be at the university to learn new things.#This is not a answer to your question but as I actively hire software engineers I wanted to contribute something which may help. Modern tech companies look for people skills and cultural fit much more intensely these days when deciding on any candidate, but especially one with less experience that will require more support (than experienced candidates) to grow and have impact. How you work with others, solve problems, grow yourself, adapt, deal with conflicts, gather requirements, seek feedback, respond to mistakes. But most importantly how you communicate. You will have gaps with technical, that’s normal, but how you think and approach your craft is what will set you and other candidates going for the same open role apart. Consider circumstances that will expose you to these areas well in your studies.#Not an engineer but sn architect myself. I think they start graduates between 2500 and 2800 these days#1. Honestly, I have no clue, since I didn't start my career in this country.2. I made an app, uploaded it to the AppStore, and then sent my CV + code + link to the app to a bunch of companies, until one of them responded and offered me an unpaid internship, which did help me land a paid job shortly afterwards, 2 months of working with experienced people was the kickstart I needed. Not sure how useful this is, considering you're a big data engineer, but maybe you can consider showing off your skills/portfolio by writing an article or doing some case study. Also if targeting a particular company, it's smart to show them that you know something that's directly useful for them, eg. a fintech company might like to see you using big data on some finance stuff, etc.3. I would have gone to more tech meetupsand joined more extra-curricular activities and/or student organizations. There's no better thing to work on now then connections. Especially for the first job/internship, you never know which one of your fellow students might be able to refer you somewhere for a job or an internship.Do ask your situation-specific questions, since different software engineers have different experiences.Also, in terms of a tech stack, I recommend that before everything you find something that you really like doing and become good doing that, but also try to match that with what the market is asking for, check some StackOverflow jobs ads eg. Don't just go with the flow and do what everyone else is doing for the sake of doing something, it's better to be highly specialised in something that's both attractive and rewarding to work with.#Thanks a lot for the tip! I'm working on some projects, but haven't thought about actually getting certified that is probably a good addition to boost up my resume.#>Personally I should have graduated sooner rather than take too much extra curriculum. You don't have to be at the university to learn new things.I'm kind of debating this as well. I'm taking some EC's, but from what I gather from this post is that it's better to enter the job market as soon as possible instead of just getting the max out of you education in the long run#Is that gross or net?#Oef dat is een stuk minder dan ik had verwacht.#Definitely try it, getting a certification is never too difficult. Actually doing stuff with the knowledge you acquire while training for it is.#As soon as you're comfortable with. I tried to max out my education by having too many subject while kicking the can forward on maths studies that I needed for advanced CS topics. I did't have a lot of focus with studies and that caused stress later on.#Gross.. definitely gross#Tbh, most graduates are still not very “useful” for a business and need a lot of coaching still. In my experience a junior sofware engineer can increase their salary pretty fast though. I doubled my salary in ~5 years. Of course, that’s harder during a crisis and it depends on your learning trajectory#Wat voor salaris had je dan in gedachte als gestudeerde, ik ben oprecht nieuwsgierig aangezien 2800 bruto voor een starter echt wel gangbaar is. Check anders op https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/1879491 hier krijg je een goed inzicht in salarissen.  Ps check anchormen.nl for internships, big data company might be good start for you.#Well . An awful lot of graduates aren't any use at first. Until you can perform basic tasks with minimal supervision you're basically an investment#Can confirm. Except it took me 10 years to double it, but that's because I wasn't changing companies often enough and was a bad negotiator.#That's true, I guess I shouldn't be too fixated on starting salary when starting my first job.#Ik dacht zelf aan ongveer 3200 - 3500, maar van wat ik heb gezien is dat niet een realistisch start-salaris buiten amerika. Bedankt voor de link het heeft mij een benodigde reality check gegeven.#This! If you want to get more salary, change often. Not too much as it will work against you. Stay with you employer for years and don’t expect to increase your salary that much. Don’t be scared that you won’t have fun colleagues somewhere else. I only had that happen to me once and I have had 12 employers in 20 years working in IT.#Ja in de usa kan je veel meer krijgen maar betaal je ook veel meer voor andere voorzieningen. Er is trouwens een reden waarom IT’ers gaan freelancen, er komt een moment dan werkgevers niet meer willen betalen, ga je freelancen dan verdubbel je je inkomen. Eerste paar jaar gewoon veel ervaring op doen, bij voorkeur een toko die aanzien heeft. Je hebt dan mogelijkheden en het open deuren.#Imo that's too many. I'd be really suspicious of so many moves#True, I overdid it. Although now it looks like I have been working as a freelancer longer than I have  )

(I don’t need high performance or high availability — just a large pool of data that is 3-2-1’d.);How does this storage planning strategy sound?**Current situation:**6 TB data on an 8 TB EasyStores, which is always offline except for backups.  Two backup copies are kept on identical 8TB externals.ONE of these 8TB EasyStores is failing/almost gone.Need to buy something this week!**How does this sound:**1. Buy a Synology 2-bay2. Buy a 14TB drive3. Load it solo in the Synology enclosure4. Now I have three data pools: 14TB, 8TB, 8TB.I only have 6TB of data so I won’t use the extra space for a while, but now I can scale when the time comes.  I can still keep two backup copies on my two 8TB externals, so no problem with 3-2-1 backups.**When my storage needs exceed 8TB:**1. Buy ANOTHER Synology 2-bay2. And ANOTHER 14TB drive3. Now I have these 3 data pools:  14TB, 14TB, 8TB4.  Since 8TB will now be inadequate for a full backup, I can save money and span the third copy across the existing 8TB and an older external, like so:14TB Synology 2-bay: DATA COPY 114TB Synology 2-bay: DATA COPY 28TB external: DATA COPY 35TB external: DATA COPY 3Then, when my needs eventually grow beyond 13TB, store DATA COPY 3 in the cloud, or add a 3rd, 2-bay Synology with a 14TB drive.Once I exceed 14TB data, I will double the size of the Synology boxes by adding 14TB drives:28TB Synology 2-bay, 2 drives: DATA COPY 128TB Synology 2-bay,2 drives: DATA COPY 2*DATA COPY 3 could either be cloud or span multiple external USB drives.*I will add:  I have no need for high availability, or high performance (RAID).  I just need a big data pool and the ability to back it up.When I need MORE than 28TB... (this might be many years down the road)... I can replace all the 14 TB drives with something bigger.I’ve thought about this a lot, and how to optimize my future purchases, and I appreciate any and all advice/critiques!(I could just kick the van down the road and buy another 14TB EasyStore, buuuut..... IDK);"A 2 bay NAS is great. But only if the growth of your hoard is very slow. Use one of the drives for shared data and the other for frequent versioned snapshot style backups. Very efficient and robust.If your hoard grows fast, buy BIG to avoid buying again and again. That will be a great waste of money in the long run. As well as a lot of frustration.Buy only the biggest available drives. 16TB.I currently have a 4x16TB NAS, and several smaller (16TB/12TB) NAS. I am building a 16 bay fileserver/NAS.I am a Linux user and I use mainly NFS. That means I can cache NFS data locally on NVMe to speed up access to the NAS. So far 1 GbE is enough for me.#Have had two ancient 2bay NAS’s when starting out, yes, it’s a terrible strategy. Eventually they can’t be reused in a convenient manner.You’ll outgrow it, and it also makes it harder to deal with cold backups. Frankly I wouldn’t even recommend 4,5 or 6 bays.I’d personally say 8 bay/mini-ITX (with a 10g Ethernet port, future you will thank you) case to start, which will let you juggle various hdd’s and SSD’s that you gather for some time to come. And if you’ve got a problem and outgrow it, but hard drives are cheaper than therapy, then you can jump to a used supermicro 36bay chassis.#What do you mean ""almost"" failing?#Nothing wrong with 2 bay solutions as long as you're comfortable with the layout options - 2 independent disks, raid 0, or 1.  It's a little limiting in that regard. Realize that you're asking a ""hoarder"" sub if they consider 2 bays enough storage.  We're obviously biased.  For most folks 2 bays can last them a long time - 16 and 18TB drives just came out and they'll eventually come down in price. I've outgrown it so I'll be selling my DS218+ in about a week after I offload some files.  In case you might be interested in lightly used gear.#Thank you, this is great info.  I guess that’s the million dollar question: what is my predicted growth rate.  Right now it’s just the photo hobby, but I’ve been lurking on this sub for a while and I’m getting an itch to hoard!In my outlined strategy, the initial cost + downstream upgrades are minimal until I hit 28TB.  ...at which point I’d need to buy all new drives for the NAS(s), or remove one of the 14TB drives in the NAS(s) and replace with a >20TB drive (when they exist) in JBOD configuration.  (I.e., 14 + 20, or 14 + 30)#Hey /u/Glix_1H !  Here we are 80 days from our earlier conversation, and I’ve come back to say:YOU WERE RIGHT!  :)“8-bays and 10GbE” was not sarcasm.Two months ago, I bought a Synology DS920+ and 3x12TB, but should have bought an 8-bay with 10GbE that you recommended.I’m going to buy a DS1819+, which is 8-bay and is 10GbE capable for $130 more.The DS920+ will now be used to back up the DS1819+, so it’s not all bad.The big question now:**Since the DS920+ has 50% less bays, what RAID should I use on it? SHR1? RAID0?**Right now I have only 11TB of data, no big deal. I can wait to decide. (Run both NAS boxes as SHR1)#8 bay and 10g! I can’t tell if that’s sarcasm.With my 2-bay strategy, I *should* be good for YEARS.  My data growth is only about 2TB/year.  Just for my DSLR hobby.  I don’t anticipate needing more than 28TB data in the next five years.Also, I don’t have a multi-thousand dollar budget.#Good question! I was trying to MD5 a few hundred GB and it was taking an inordinate amount of time.  When I pulled out the backup mirror and ran the same task, it was much faster.  I have read that long read/write times can indicate a failing drive, and I seemed to have isolated the problem to that one drive.#Thank you very much.  I appreciate your reply.  Fair point on the bias in a datahoarder sub. :) That said, I’m thinking 4-bay or larger now.One thing I’m considering is 10GBe. I will probably want it eventually.  Do you know if there an advantage to buying a Synology with 10GBe built in, or one where I can upgrade to 10GBe later?  Do you know if the new DS920+ can be upgraded to 10GBe?  I can’t tell.#FYI, a single HDD (~220-150MB/s sequential) easily saturates 1G Ethernet (110MB/s), whereas even the most extensive NAS configurations here can sit comfortably within 10G. You will notice and greatly appreciate the difference when browsing files, especially in a mirror configuration that allows for scaling read speeds with more mirrors.Basically pick a board that has either 10G or enough sata ports so you don’t create a dead end for yourself in a few years. You then use the pcie slot to cover whatever it doesn’t have onboard.Alternatively, you can use an older computer in its old case. Idle energy costs also may not turn out to be that much as you thought.#On second look, it seems that any ITX option with either what I suggested quickly gets pricey (even at the $300 low end would be better spent on a large board and cpu, with money left over). I could have sworn there was something reasonable I had seen in the past.In that case, reusing an older pc is frankly the way to go, and if you don’t have one, eBay or goodwill would be my first stops.#Check the SMART data.#I'm asking coz recent hdd don't fail so quickly unless heat or vibrations are involved. Being a USB enclosure, I'm sure you run it beside your desk, move it around and with only open air. This may be why it's failing. I think your disks run at 50-60C everyday lol.Get a dedicated space for your externals where there's little human contact as possible. You don't seem like you would want to spend on a nas. A nas is mostly used as a central area for your files 24/7 which you didn't mention.There's no point and you're simply wasting your money if you don't require it. I suggest start by having a space and get some usb fans and direct them to the disk. Also, raid 1 (mirror) is not recommended. Just have 2 14TBs and backup manually between them. They WON'T fail as fast if you just add those USB fans.#Looks like you'd have to buy the DS1618+ or DS1817 for 10G support.  They are about $750-800.  [Synology products with 10G capability](https://www.synology.com/en-us/products?lan=10gbe_built_in%2C10gbe_optional)10G is nice to have but it's a lot more affordable if you can take advantage of used enterprise stuff that uses SFP+ instead of ethernet.  That would mean building your own server (e.g. build guides on [serverbuilds.net](https://www.serverbuilds.net/)).  If you're the type who likes to build and tinker then you can actually achieve more performance for less money than Synology products.  Synology just makes everything plug and play + point and click.  A lot of people are willing to pay extra for that ease and convenience.#Thanks for the info! I will check out 10GBE.  At first glance, it looks like 10GBE + 10GBE switch is at least $500.  (Yikes!). I guess the figure will contain more data, not less, so maybe I should bite the bullet.#Ahh, that’s a bummer.  Are there any go-to PC models for this purpose?  How much would you budget for an eBay find?  Thanks for your reply, I appreciate the information.Oh, and as to the power consumption and noise... minimal is best, but since it will be powered on for a day or two once a month, maybe it is not a big deal.#I’ll investigate, thanks!  At first glance, CrystalDisk is for Windows.  Any recommendations for MacOS?#Thanks!  I’m going to run a SMART check on the disk once this backup finishes (but, perhaps unsurprisingly, it is stuck on copying a 30 MB file for the last half hour).  I’ll see about positioning the USB drives in a way that cools them better.#This is really great info, thank you.  And thanks for that link!  I do like to tinker, but I think for my first time I want a solid, easy NAS experience.  My data is irreplaceable, and I just want it to work in a straightforward way right now.   My 2nd NAS (a back up for the primary NAS) would be a fun DIY project.One thing I don’t understand are the read/write performance tiers.  I thought it was either 10GBe, *or* 1BGe, but it also looks like Synology has link aggregation, which looks like middle-tier performance?Ideally, from a use perspective, it would be nice to edit 4K video direct from the NAS, without having to copy the files to my laptop.#Generally the best way to go for 10g is sfp+ fiber. That’s what most of us use around here.You can get a used single port Mellanox Connectx3 card off eBay for around $40 (make sure they have both tall and low profile brackets). These work in both Linux and windows as is. They’ll need ~$8 sfp+ transceiver for each card port (finistar works great). You can connect them directly if you don’t mind network configuration bullshit, or use a $140 MikroTik CRS305-1G-4S+IN.So ~$100, not including the fiber cable for direct connection and forum diving. ~$260 EZ mode with switch (two cables and 2 additional transceivers)The cable used is any OM3 or OM4 fiber with LC/LC connectors. Amazon is a good source. This has a bonus of being super easy to get by doors in an apartment non destructively. Use blue painters tape or gaffers tape to secure it.Funny enough, it was actually dealing with my own photographs on a NAS that made me get fed up with 1G. I was using an old computer as a NAS at that point, and found myself attaching a monitor and keyboard to it just to deal with it sometimes.#It’s been a long while since I’ve looked at things myself, I’m not sure of the current market. I may have a look this evening out of my own curiosity, and since I’m seeing a ton of “need NAS, what do?” around. Offhand, even earlier gen ryzen chips idle pretty low. If your deafest on just two disks, finding an old workstation pc at a thrift store or craigslist could be a way to go. If new enough it’ll likely be an Intel with an adequate idle power draw, have at least 2 sata ports, and likely even have a pcie slot.#https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/135565/how-do-i-get-detailed-smart-disk-information-on-os-x-mavericks-or-later#You totally disregard my advice about adding fans. Facepalm. 30MB is bad, your computer maybe failing as its recognizing it as USB 2.0. not the fault of the drive at all.#This is fantastic!  I greatly appreciate your help.  Very eager to run the test and get some objective data on my perceived problem.#It has already copied 5TB to it in 51 hours*, but now it seems to be going slow on some files that aren’t terribly large (RAW camera files that are about 30MB each).*I’m trying to do a full backup to it (why not!), and ran a deletion pass at the start.

selfpublish;hygv6g;1595804921.0;/r/selfpublish/comments/hygv6g/online_reading_platforms_which_are_actually_good/;Online reading platforms: which are actually good for authors?;Times are constantly changing for writers and how they put out their work. The new(ish) trending thing after self publishing on through things like KDP and the likes are all these reading apps. They're not necessarily NEW, as ones like Bookrix have existed for decades, but Wattpad has sensationalized them and led to the creation of many more. But which ones are actually good for authors? I've been trying to figure this out, and have a pretty solid list of what to avoid for this reason or that, but am having a hard time nailing down the good ones. The obvious avoid ones are Dreame and Webnovel. They are super shady for a few reasons, either because they constantly steal art and photos for their ads, or have contracts that make it impossible for authors to earn money. The ones I am unsure about are Hinovel (seems too new, and does the same shady practice of trying to poach popular authors from other platforms as Dreame and Webnovel), Sofanovel (I just don't know anything about it) and Inkitt. Inkitt I am unsure about because it USED to be a scam for authors, and I just can't find ANY information on it that isn't a few years old.Wattpad isn't really super viable for anyone but a select few, and should really be seen as a platform to gain an audience, as monetary options are scarce and don't pay out well for the few who are accepted.  That, and the ad revenue doesn't go to authors, and they had a pretty big data breach recently and took DAYS to respond to it, so a lot of popular authors, myself included, are looking to migrate.The ones that SEEM to be positive for authors are Booknet, Neovel, and Radish, but I do not have extensive experience with any of them. Neovel seems like a great concept (authors share ad revenue based on reads) though it is VERY new. They just finished their kickstarter campaign, which is a good sign, but will take some time to fully kick off. Radish is pretty kind to authors from what I have heard, though they have an application form to get in and prefer your works to not have been posted anywhere else when you join. And Booknet I don't know a ton about besides knowing one author who really loves it and makes decent money off of it.My question is, has anyone here had experience with any of these? Good, bad, mixed? The writing scene these days is a minefield to navigate, and these reading websites seem to offer a good and different opportunity to authors, but everything has a catch. I'd love to hear everyone's experiences with these kinds of sites, and hopefully bring some clarity to the whole situation. Thanks!;I started with Wattpad and then signed non-exclusive contract with Dreame (when it was still new) but surprisingly, it worked well even though it is a bit shady. I recommend applying for Radish, they are really supportive and explain everything if you have any doubts regarding your work or the contract. I recently signed a contract with them and I think it's going to work out pretty well.If you already have an audience, start a Patreon. You can post chapters in serialised manner (like Wattpad, Radish) on Patreon if you want. I hope this helps! :-)#I recommend Bhooks ([https://bhooks.com/](https://bhooks.com/)). You can't earn money there, but it's free and totally worth a look imo. It has a really useful critique and feedback system, as well as some cool features that don't exist (to my knowledge) on other writing websites, e.g. automatically provides downloads of your stories for e-readers.#WriterShelf is designed a writer-centric option in this space. We're working to make it easy to publish and build a connected audience as well as flexible for monetizing your work. We'd welcome feedback from authors exploring new ways to publish.#try medium.com...........#Thank you! I still cannot support dreame because of them stealing art, but I definitely would love to work with radish.#I’ll check it out, thanks :)#Isn’t that more for articles and shorts?#you can write short fiction and non fiction on medium...#That is what I thought!

archlinux;hpszui;1594553548.0;/r/archlinux/comments/hpszui/pacman_pip_conda_aurhelpers_ecetera/;Pacman, Pip, Conda, Aur-helpers ecetera;Hello, I have questions about files and managing them. I’ve recently began doing Big Data work at university which has me using scientific programs for data analysis. I have seen many people using Anaconda to manage their programs. Q. Is this advised ?Q. Is there an alternative ?I’m also curious about AURhelpers. I have read on the arch wiki to manual install and build AUR packages.Q. Is this advised to be built in /home ? /usr/local ?Edit: this was sparked from python conflicts.Any help is much appreciated.Kind regards,Boogz;"I would prefer anaconda only if I didn't want to install every package individually. I personally use `pacman` to install any python-package. If the package isn't available in the repos, I use `pip` to install them.For the most part, using an AUR helper doesn't harm you but the packages in the AUR aren't moderated, i.e. anyone can upload any package on the AUR. So it is always recommended to read the `PKGBUILD` before installing anything from the AUR.It is always advised to install packages through `pip` through the user and not as root. Hope this helps :)DM me if you're still unsure.#Use miniconda, a command line version of conda, to install programs. This keeps them isolated in environments so their dependencies don't conflict. Conda is ideal for science because they already have ""channels"" like bioconda, that have prebuilt package recipes. Installation can be as simple as `conda install $PROGRAM`. Then you can activate the environment and use either pip or conda to install python libraries.As far as AUR goes, I build them in my home folder, you don't have to add it to your $PATH.#What I do is use python-module packages from pacman/aur for anything that needs python 3.8. For anything that needs an older version of python (cough cough tensorflow 1.x), create a virtual environment (python3.7 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate), and use pip3.7 to install dependencies in that environment. Change 3.7 to the version you want of course. This has the advantage that all your system dependencies are managed by the system, and any old projects are left alone. I haven't used anaconda personally, so I can't comment of that.#One benefit of using AUR-compatible package managers is that they handle dependencies that are also on the AUR. While manual building via `makepkg` is the official recommended way, using tools like [Aura](https://github.com/fosskers/aura) or [Yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) can speed your life up.#pipx does the same for normal python packages.#Thank you for your reply, I’m completely at a loss with virtual environments outside of basic VMware solutions, so I’ll have to scratch up on that and give it a crack.#Are there any drawbacks ? Do they clutter your system ?#Oh no, not that kind of virtualization. All it does it creates another python 'installation' in the folder you give as an argument (in my case .venv). Then when you source the activation script, it sets up your environment to use that installation instead of your system installation. This means you can have different modules installed than your system. When you are done using that environment, use 'deactivate' and you will be using system python from then on. If you don't need older versions though, just stick with the pacman packages.#Give pyenv a look: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#Packages from the AUR are not checked. There could be anything in them, so common practice is to read the pkgbuild carefully. Installing an aur helper can lead to willy-nilly installing of aur packages.That said though, I never encountered malicious code on the aur.#Not any more than normal packages would. In the end, they're all installed in the same way, and can be managed in the same way.`aura -Cc` can help you keep your global package cache clean, and Aura also scans PKGBUILDs for malicious bash code before building.#So to avoid plenty of conflict (currently facing) ? This is interesting. Do you have any sources you used to learn this ? Or just by googling around ?#I’ve just wiped my system, save Linux Linux-firmware, wish me luck lol#The arch wiki is a good start, but it a little short when it comes up python specifically"

MinIO tested on Jupter + PySpark;;"The whole ideia of ditching HDFS looks good to me. Modern cloud deployments don't use it anymore and use blob storage for it (S3, Azure Data Lake Store) in replacement of HDFS, so having an option to do it ""on-premises"" is nice with MinIO (and K8). Still, this kind of tech will eventually take a lot of effort to tune and maintain at production scale.#Nice fun hacky experiment, kudos for getting it working.. 😁But IMO it isnt practical to use MinIO for a Hadoop cluster. You'd be throwing away an extremely mature very fast distributed file system for one that is less capable, while adding tons of operational overhead and risk. Dataproc & EMR are more than just Hadoop using a cloud bucket, these have tons of customizations that enable them to do this reliabily. Also GCS & S3 are massive systems that have been hardened over time and managed by an army of SREs.#you'd be surprised how easy it is to run MinIO at scale :P#I disagree, we have conducted a [great amount of tests against HDFS](https://min.io/resources/docs/MinIO-vs-HDFS-MapReduce-performance-comparison.pdf) for MapReduce, [Spark](https://min.io/resources/docs/Performance-comparison-Apache-Spark.pdf) and [Presto](https://min.io/resources/docs/Performance-comparison-Starburst-Presto-SQL.pdf) and concluded that the only advantage that HDFS gets is the scheduling of workloads on the same node as where the data lives, however this is not efficient at scale, it even becomes expensive, with disaggregated storage (MinIO for storage and separate Compute) you can build way bigger infrastructure by investing in cheaper, more dense storage nodes and separately fast compute nodes with lots of ram where in Hadoop Ecosystem you need to buy expensive nodes that are both storage and compute :PMinIO doesn't do replication like HDFS (3 copies by def), it does erasure coding (data+parity) so you can leverage your storage better!We have also done comparison of MinIO vs EMR on the papers I linked before, it shows that MinIO is on par with S3 performance.I want to change the image you have of MinIO, any question you have feel free to ask it at r/minio :D#I think you are right. Hadoop cluster will be more ""predictable"" and maintainable as a whole solution than some components put together on top of MinIO. I'm wondering how MinIO would compare to Apache Ozone#FYI: HDFS also does erasure coding#I find people get excited about these types of projects because they're fun.. they fail to ask the more important question, should I. Trying to use non-standard configurations for anything in production puts you on a island by yourself. Something breaks or you have a performance issue, there are no documentation, forum posts or tools to help resolve the issue. You need help, you have somehow find the small handful of people doing what you're doing and they most likely havent seen the same issue, worse is if they have which means you have some bug or incompatibility you can't resolve easily. IMO there is no reason to do this. The big value add here is having a storage system that can scale beyond the limits you might see with cloudera.. but honestly it's far better to just create a new cluster and split the workload. I haven't used Ozone yet but it looks interesting..#oohh, I was not aware of that, when I used to setup HDFS clusters back in 2016 I was only aware of the replication factor, this is good intel, thanks!#IIRC starting with Hadoop 3.0 you can use erasure coding"

datascience;hlr4xw;1593972489.0;/r/datascience/comments/hlr4xw/value_of_sql_in_data_science/;Value of SQL in data science;Someone help me understand the real value of SQL in a data science job? IME other than querying big data it offers me very little in the form of visualization, storytelling, stats, models, cross validation, and feature engineering. Is there something I am missing?;"""Other than getting me the data that my company has stored what's the value?""How are you going to do any of the tasks you listed if you can't get to the data that's stored in your employer's data bases? You mentioned ""querying big data"", but it's wrong to think that SQL is only used at companies with data on the scale of ""big data"". SQL is an absolutely essential skill.#Not learning SQL in data science is like trying to write a book without learning grammar.Sure you might come up with an end product but you're severely limiting your capacity.#80% of data science is getting the data. That is a cliche for a reason.#It's where your going to get almost all of your data. Classes tend to use CSV files because they're easier but most data at companies is in SQL#I'm going to ask because your question sounds, at face value, very disingenuous.Are you trying to understand why SQL is valuable, or are you trying to validate your opinion that it isn't?I ask because if your answer is the latter, then nothing here will change your mind. Technically you can sidestep SQL - it just means you'll be dependent on other people to get you data, and to bring to your attention any issues with the size/complexity/etc of the data that you're requesting.As an analogy: if your job was to critique French books, you could in theory just have someone else transcribe every book for you and summarize it at your convenience. But not only does that make you dependent on a French speaker, but also will limit your ability to interact with the original text itself, which means it's likely that there will be a lot more stuff lost in translation.#If someone will get you data and store them in the way you need, you don't need SQL at all.  And you don't need to know stat or visualization if someone will do it for you.#There's a lot of feature engineering that can be done with SQL.#Let's talk about a dimensional model. Where you can store each store alongside the relevant info in one dim table, each product  and the info on another one, each customer on another one, each cashier on another etc. etc.Now... if you didn't use dbs, how are you going to store all that info? In huge CSVs? That would be about 300GBs of daily data for medium retail stores. It doesn't even make sense for the company to keep customer data in .csvs.Ok so you create the relevant dimensions and store to the db. I was working on a small company and we had around 400 tables (+ 40-50 views for queries running on bi).You will have slowly changing dimensions, ( price of product changing maybe, or contact details of a customer ) , you will have stepped dimensions ( stage of order ) and others.How the hell are you going to get exactly what you need if you don't query the db?Say for example analyse length of stages during the order (how delays contribute to customer churn?)This isn't Kaggle where the .csvs are 200MB, I am talking about 10s of TB of data. And you don't have to navigate 2 tables and perform the join, you have to do some logic using 10 or more tables.Or are you going to run some complex python on 10TB files (that only cover 1 month of orders?).Question:  Let's say you prototyped a  model, that needs to run at midnight (which potential customers your company should approach the following day) and seems to be working well. How are you going to put that in production? I mean, where the data it needs is coming from, and where the output is going to, so your sales people can have a list at the start of the day?The real fun begins when you have streaming data, data from RDBMs and data from NoSQL and you need to blend them to create your model. When you discover K-SQL,CQL and whatever else, you will be thanking god that you can query NoSQL using SQL.#How would you obtain the data without SQL?#Thanks for the responses. The general consensus is that SQL plays a significant role in data storage, data collection, and org culture. Especially large, structured data.#SQL is a standard database language that is used to create, maintain and retrieve relational databases.  SQL has become a very important tool in a data scientist's toolbox since it is critical in accessing, updating, inserting, manipulating and modifying data.#In an industry setting the data exists in huge data bases. Incoming logs will have a completely different schema than the table that would be useful to you. Moreover, you probably won't be able to load even a day's worth onto your local machine. SQL lets you access and aggregate the relevant parts of these massive datasets.#20% getting the data (sorry, DB permissions ticket still pendling in IT, sorry  DBeaver not Installed, sorry DB driver not installed).70% data cleaning (2 different time formats in column, one with a non-existing date - hello 31.09.2019, % or € in front and/or behind in the same column, 5 different ways to write ""yes"", article numbers in 4 different lengrhs and formats including letters but only sometimes and on different positions).Fucking finally some EDA/DA/DS.Oh boy, can't what for that Excel sheet again tomorrow.#Yes. They make it look so easy. Python and R are often romanticized in any data science online course. But SQL, Git, Bash, Docker and a few others are also a big part of the job and nobody seems to comment on them during the first part of these online courses.#My question was genuine. I want to understand why it receives so much weight as a data science skill. I work as a data scientist and my company's primary RDBMS is SQL Server. I need to use SQL about 5% of the time, mainly for some basic SELECT FROM statements. Beyond that it offers ME very little although its foundational to the company.#You didn't include API calls failing, parts of data missing just because, and dim tables being messed up by the previous engineers.Then when EDA starts, the rules (logical model) you got from the business people / head of departments do not actually apply to what you are seeing.#I've never used Docker but heard it mentioned a lot. What is it used for in data science?#If you have small volumes of data, then select * from is fine.Most companies have databases that a) have tables that are too big to just select * from, b) are composed of a bunch of tables that make it even less practical to select * from each of them.So, if you work for one of those companies, you need to learn how to write SQL queries, and the more you want to do, the more queries you need to write.#What you mean they changed how they collected the region variable six times over time and the rules for it are with the sales team and they just assign it however they want? That never happens!"

Should I start a undergraduate course or I can take short term courses in Big Data majors?;[deleted];Big Data Online courses on Edx or Coursera might give you a head start#If you're interested you can do any Certification from Cloudera. That will add for getting jobs easily since you don't have any real time experience. These certifications focuses on hands-on expertise in particular technologies.#It is definitely not worth going through 4 years to get through Big data. You should either go for online courses, a Bootcamp program or potentially a master degree rather than going for a full-on bachelor course. So either:1) Follow some online courses  - this should get you at least started with some knowledge in the domain.  EDX, Coursera or Udacity all offer a decent offering to get started in the domain. Before going full-on on Big data I would suggest taking a few more courses on Python and SQL. I have recently written about how to [learn data science](https://medium.com/analytics-and-data/how-to-learn-data-science-from-scratch-3d129e1b4f31) from online resources and I think going into Big data does require some similar base knowledge in terms of Python/SQL.EDX has a few nice courses from BekeleyX on Apache Spark (a framework used in Big data): * [BerkeleyX: CS100.1x Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS100.1x/1T2015/course/)* [BerkeleyX: CS105x Introduction to Apache Spark](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:BerkeleyX+CS105x+1T2016/course/)* [BerkeleyX: CS120x Distributed Machine Learning with Apache Spark](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:BerkeleyX+CS120x+2T2016/course/)* [BerkeleyX: CS190.1x Scalable Machine Learning](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS190.1x/1T2015/course/)Udacity has an [introduction to data engineering](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) \- which is currently in free access for a month.2) I am not sure where you are based, but data engineering bootcamps might be available.  The most famous data engineering Bootcamp is [the Insight program](https://insightfellows.com/data-engineering) in the US, which teaches the basics of data engineering in about 7 weeks. Chances are there might be a data engineering Bootcamp program close to where you live. 3) Aim for a postgraduate / Master degree in big data, analytics, or data science  - at least that way you would limit the time spent learning from 4 years to 1 single year. Given that you are already pursuing a postgraduate course, I don't think this would be the preferable option, compared to self-learning with some MOOC.#[deleted]#Depends in your case getting one certification for display will be a good decision..if you can showcase your github profile with projects you have worked on will be mre beneficial. With that what course(s) did you choose ?
uchicago;hr0cey;1594728664.0;/r/uchicago/comments/hr0cey/mpcs_course_recommendations/;MPCS Course Recommendations;I'm starting the MPCS (9 course) in the autumn quarter. I studied math/stats undergrad and have been working as a data scientist in Chicago for 4 years. I'm doing the MPCS because at every company I've worked at they've struggled to actually implement machine learning models into their computing environments, so I'd like to improve my CS skills to be able to do that. Or, perhaps work more as a traditional software engineer if I find that I like that more than data science.My goal is to work as a quantitative researcher/developer at a trading company.Here are the courses I'm planning on taking, let me know if you've taken them or have any thoughts on them. A lot of these are from the 12 course High Performance Computing specialization. I use python/R/SQL extensively every day at work (I shadowed the python core programming and it was far too easy), so I'd like to focus on c and c++ in order to learn something new and be able to write some high performance software. It seems like all the trading companies really value c++, so that's my biggest goal from this program.Autumn: Advanced Programming (in C), Algorithms, Big Data Application ArchitectureWinter:  Computer Architecture, High Performance Computing, C++ 1Spring: C++ 2, Distributed Systems, and another core systems class Also any general thoughts on the core systems classes? I was initially planning on taking Intro to Computer Systems, but then I read that it's literally just nand2tetris and I could go do that on my own.Is the High Performance Computing class worth it? It's basically doing openMP, MPI, CUDA stuff in C. I've heard mixed reviews on how much this will be useful for getting a job at a trading company as they seem to value c++ much more than C.Or any other general thoughts/course recommendations for someone looking to work as a quant at a trading firm?Thanks!;I have TA'd about 3 of the classes you have listed, and some others in MPCS. HPC does focus on MPI, CUDA, OpenMP, and exclusively used C (at least when I was helping with the class), but those tools are also useful with C++. And the general lessons from parallel programming taught in the course are broadly applicable. It's a great course, and I think it would be useful for your objectives. You might also consider [https://mpcs-courses.cs.uchicago.edu/2020-21/summer/courses/58020](https://mpcs-courses.cs.uchicago.edu/2020-21/summer/courses/58020)#Hi, I graduated last year taking most of the classes you list and have got a job at a HFT firm in Chicago. Yours seems quite a good path. I would absolutely add OS tough. I believe it is quite essential and a game changer for your understanding of how a computer works (also done in C). If you have more questions I am open!#Thanks your response. I did take note of the time series course you mentioned but I covered most of that material in my math/stats undergrad.There is another course called 'parallel programming' but it seems to me like it would be a waste to do both that course and the HPC course? Any thoughts on that?#Good to know - thanks! operating systems sounds like a good choice for my third core systems class. How about the interview process for trading companies? What role do you have (software engineer vs quantitative researcher)? Was it similar to other major tech company interviews? Did they place emphasis on certain things?#I am not familiar with the Parallel Programming course  I believe it was created after HPC, which originally was called Applied Parallel Programming when I took it in 2011.Glancing at the syllabus, it does not seem to cover MPI and might focus more on threading. The HPC course was created and is (usually/always) taught by scientists from Argonne National Lab, so it has somewhat of a bent towards scientific supercomputing.#Software engineer. Can't say much about quant (for those there will be also many math problems).The interview for the hfts is not too different from any other major tech interview.In my company the interview process was more humane than in other trading or tech companies. It was Shorter, more personal and focusing more on how you think on a real world problem instead of the classic 3 or 4 weird leetcode medium/hard.Surely emphasis on data structures and algo in my experience. Algo you have to take it. But I recommend advanced programing for sure for the knowledge of data structures that it gives. I also audited hpc and I would recommend to try it at least. Both taught by Siegel which I really like.Yes C++ is way more common. But you need to do C to understand memory management and pointers. Something you are probably really not conscious of right now. I would recommend also to study some C before advanced programing. It kinda expects you to know it. Or else you can always take C programing.

I’m taking these classes next semester but was wondering how they were. I’m taking AI with Joe Johnson and Big Data with Raj, I heard it is more algorithms based with Raj but wasn’t sure how difficult this class was. Thanks!;Took big data with Wei Wei last semester, it was very application based but at the same time we needed to know the algorithms pretty well. I had a pretty rough time with it because it moved very fast however it was very interesting at the same time. The lectures seem a bit useless but if you read the book before hand it sticks a lot better. If you have any other questions feel free to ask.#I took with Raj in the spring of 2019. It felt like an algorithms class. The class can feel challenging, but never overly difficult. Plus you will still learn a lot despite it being not as application-based that Wei Wei teaches it. As an undergrad, you are only graded on the homework and the exams. Resuing the lectures from previous semesters helps so much when needing to study. It should still be available if he is using the same site.Exams are tough but they reinforce ideas from the homework, so as long as you are prepared you should be fine. Also for both midterms, you will always get your grade back by the next class sessions, which is kind of crazy looking back on it.#I have nothing to offer but I’m gonna take those classes too hello#Yes, with Raj it is far more Algorithms based. With Wei Wei, its very hands on although you are expected to understand the theory as well, just not to the same extent. Wei Weis was pretty fun, although the lectures were sometimes dull.#Joe Johnson was one of my favorite profs in the UConn CS department. He's a bit sarcastic and may seem very blunt at times, but he does care a lot about the material. He also really respects people who put the effort in (participate in class, go to office hours). The course material for AI might be tough for some people. It focuses on some advanced logic stuff (modal logic). There was also a $100 software we needed to do a few homeworks related to the subject. I found that stuff really fun and interesting, but my friends did not. Another big topic of the class was on solving recursive problems in different scopes (in the functional language SML, very similar to CSE 1729 but cranked up a notch). I found this stuff a lot more challenging, but I was able to get through it thanks to office hours + explanations from friends.Overall I enjoyed the class a ton. It's a bit more logic/theory driven than a more practical class like Machine Learning, but I felt it was a good challenge for my senior year.#[deleted]#Also did Big Data with Wei Wei. Absolutely loved that class, and use it for my career(s) regularly.#Yes, it was [Hands on Machine Learning](https://images.app.goo.gl/G7iUDxkFKVdo99AK7) it’s taught in python.#We also used Deep Learning with Python by Francois Chollet

Not sure how MBB prestige from developing countries translates into the admission process* Do you think scholarships are reachable? With current exchange rates my savings are worthless in USD. I was thinking about retaking GMAT to increase odds of a full ride or substantial financial aid (I ended up having only 2 weeks to prepare for the test due to project demands and got as high as 770 in the official practice exams). What are your thoughts on that?* With current visa issues, would you wait for another year before applying? I'm specially considering LBS and Insead  for international opportunities with the current state in US* I'm eligible for being sponsored by my MBB but then would have to return to my country for 2 years. How reasonable would be to leverage my school network to find a position in US after being out of the program for that long? Not too familiar with H1B visa programsThanks in advance for all your feedback!";Fantastic profile—only concern I can see is that you’ll be a bit below average/median work experience at all the top programs, but honestly think it’s worth a shot anyway.Anyone who has strong enough a profile to apply to Stanford should apply to Harvard as well, since it’s always a crapshoot. I think scholarships are definitely within reach and you could probably add more M7 schools to your target list.Sounds like you definitely don’t ‘need’ an MBA right now if you’re enjoying and staying engaged while working at an MBB. 1 or 2 more years of WE might give you more perspective on where you want to end up post BSchool.Oh and if you’re sick of your President in your home country, just wait till you get a load of ours.#Will your firm sponsor you? A paid-for MBA plus 2-3 more years in MBB would be a way more feasible route to your career goals then hoping for scholarships, taking on a bunch of debt and going through recruitment. Just a thought.#If you could squeeze out another 20 points you’ll have an amazing GMAT score. What were you scoring on your practice exams?#I would also add Yale SOM to your schools list.  They also tend to be generous on aid for students with social impact experience and intentions.#Thanks for the feedback!Really valid point on the waiting a couple more years before applying. I have quite a few friends from MBB that are applying this year so that was one of the reasons to go earlier.I heard bad things about HBS quality of life due to the case method. Any thoughts on that?I was hoping you'd vote yours out this November haha. I wish you good luck with that. Stay safe and cheers#Yes, definitely one of my options. Only doubt would be the difficulty of pivoting industries to a new country. We have only small VC funds where I live so would much rather be in US for that career path#I've heard they are really focused on NGOs and philanthropy. Haven't researched much about the school yet. Thanks for the input, will have to take a look now#I don’t know the firm, but I know of people who were from other countries, sponsored by firm, and ended up in a US office#I believe Yale has a lot of content at the intersection of business + impact beyond nonprofit/philanthropy.  You mentioned Bridgespan which is very focused on nonprofit so sounded like you wanted that content.  If you want social impact mixed with for-profit models, I went to Haas and it was the right balance of tech/startup/VC/innovation with social impact.  If you are interested in VC, Wharton might be good to add on but it will be in the reach category potentially and probably less likely to get a scholarship.  Overall you sound like a strong candidate with a good story.#I’ll also add to check out career reports, Yale sent 2.6% into nonprofit and almost 5% to PE/VC.  Barely anyone goes directly into NGO work even at the most “nonprofit” schools.  The exit opportunities in other industries like consulting, tech, IB are just too lucrative I suppose.#That's just what I had heard from a friend. Most of the people I know went sponsored by MBB so they really didn't have much knowledge about employment reports. Will also add Wharton to the list to consider, hadn't tough much about it yet.#If it’s helpful this was my application list (having had a social impact consulting background): HBS, GSB, Wharton, Kellogg, Haas, MIT Sloan, Yale SOM, Duke Fuqua.  If you are looking for scholarships maybe also add Ross, Cornell?.  If Social VC is your target, you’ll want to go to the highest ranked school you can afford irrespective of scholarship $.

It comes to a point where even the internet radio stops for some seconds. Data transfers to the nas are full Gigabit (>100MB/s). I have some knowledge about networking, but can't figure this one out. The switch should work as normal since it has 40 times the bandwidth of that. Any ideas?;"When these backups happen, they don't happen to have to be routed through the router do they?  The only thing that pops in my mind that would cause such a network drag is if the routers having to route all of that and is choking on the bandwidth.#i do 10gb from my vrtx blade chassis to my hp dl 180 g6 using solarflare cards and dac cables and this does not slow down the network as its isolated and directly attached, you should look into the same thing for your setup as it won't saturate your 1gb connections and have to go through the router, maybe even isolate it and put it all on a 1gb switch and see if that makes a difference#It's anything here sharing a network cable when these transfers are going on?Can you draw a diagram of his everything is connected, and what devices you're transferring between?#What are you using from ISP? Take a look at your cpu usage. I have seen while troubleshooting slow internet the bottleneck being the cpu, in this case on the R720 if its routing with Sophos or whatever is doing your routing. Even if data transfer is on the LAN, the cpu of whatever is routing isn' t able to process your WAN traffic and LAN traffic at the same time. It may be a bit of a stretch in this case but worth looking into. Another possibilty I could think of off the top of my head is SQM.#Diagram/IP layout would be very helpful right now.Problem is, everything i read about the 748T (v1 anyway) says its Layer2 only, so everything MUST be going through your firewall?  This would make sense as to why everything hangs up possibly?#It shouldn't as it's on the same interface. Not routed or filtered for local devices.#I missed this comment but this is what I am thinking as well#Possibly. I have the v3 version which says its a L2+/L3 lite. But since I havent fiddled with nw layers, I don't quite understand what this means.If I understood correct, L2 is for mac-address management, and L3 is for IP address management? If only the L3 can ""direct"" traffic by IP address, then it sounds normal. But I believe the CPU on the firewall would spike during that time, whereas mine hasn't gotten above 20%. Dunno, really buffled with this#Do you have different VLANs on your network? If it's a layer 2 switch and you're transferring data between VLANs it has to go through the router.#Can do a traceroute to your nas from whatever. If it does anything more than 1 hop, you found your problem#It’s a layer 3 switch, and my suspect here is the switch. I’m curious how are the VLANs set up.#Traceroute returns the NAS immediately#It's an L2+/L3 lite(GS748T v3).

All the other traffic goes untaggedIf I tracert the NAS, I get immediate response. Traffic from/to NAS goes full gigabit speed. ONLY when full speed traffic is ongoing to the NAS, the network bogs down.Cpu from Sophos never went above 20%. Ever.&#x200B Hope that helps. If you need anything else, I'm happy to provide.&#x200B Logged in to sophos immediately, Port 1 (the LAN port) has minimum bandwidth, which doesn't seem to route traffic (FreeNAS has current 42MB/s traffic, sfos reports 45Mb/s (Mbit), so doesn't seem like it. Really confused here.Except IF, the switch can't direct traffic and sfos doesn't report internal traffic, but only internal to external and vice versa#Hope [this](https://imgur.com/V4EvWeg) helps clear up a bit. Sorry for the poor drawing, first timer here.I kept the network as simple as possible. Normal LAN traffic and machines go without VLAN and I have only 1 VLAN for guest internet access, without allowing access to network. Sophos is tagged, Wifi is tagged and both their ports are tagged from the switch for VLAN10, apart from normal traffic.VLAN is only for wifi and is enabled when someone is connected on the guest wifi. Anything else connected to the internal wifi works as normal.So server, NAS etc are direct, no DMZ.#I'm not sure if your firewall can, but any chance you can enable monitoring to see if packets are passing through?

westworld;hxjyx1;1595669243.0;/r/westworld/comments/hxjyx1/just_my_thoughts_after_finally_finishing_s3/;Just my thoughts after finally finishing S3;"S3 was a stretch, and it wasnt hard to understand so much as it made no good sense. The incentives were all wrong, because Dolores is the only thing that matters. In the same boat, the whole Rohoboam thing was the only *juicy* part of it. I had my scifi nerve tickled by the thought of big data predicting people and social patterns, but that was about it. I also have a problem with how people used it, how it seemed to be a tool of Ceracs' alone, which Cerac seems to not respect or understand the power of it all. In the same boat, they missed an opportunity to create a larger threat for Dolores in the machine. Imagine if Dolores was up against the machine itself. If somehow, she would need to go up against ""a god"". I think that S4 needs a few things to happen for me to stay interested in the series. 1) Ford, Arnold, and the other ""architects"" need to be brought up more. While I understand he may not be in the series anymore and has played his role, none of this would exist without him and the series has forgotten the strongest character the show has ever received. Same could be said of Will and Delos, while I did appreciate their roles in S3 quite a lot.  2) The idea of free will in the hosts was totally eclipsed by the concept of no free will in the guests as we came to understand Rohoboam. This created a problem. The creators were then able to dance around free will, and say ""Rohoboam predicted this or that, buttttttt anomalies""!! While I understand anomalies are meant to show the true spirit of free will in people, the conversation on screen become convoluted. It's all about Rohoboam this, Dolores that, Caleb this, Cerac that. It's no longer about dynamics between players of the game, now it's about winners and losers. Boring!!!3) The breaking out into the real world is byfar the most interesting part of S3, and they gave us cookie crumbs. I want to know more about the world before I can feel convinced of any side of argument. We didnt know enough about the government or the people to say, well ya who cares if they're all being guided. Life didnt look great under guidance but we really couldn't know. All inference we get on this is from Caleb's point of view, or Hale's outside life. Everything else is business. When we get to the deeper parts of S3 it becomes important. They discuss human extinction, and something like that shouldnt be brought up and solved within 5 episodes. Big mistake. No tension during those final moments in the season for me, and that was due to lack of build up. 1) More Ford, more Delos, more roots (Its fun to grow into new things, but remember what we liked to begin with)2) Free will needs to be part of the conversation and plot, not just a tool to make the viewer feel like one person has advantage over another3) Big topics need time to grow, and we need time for the outside world to grow on us";

Kind of like 'big data' and 'machine learning' and 'cloud' did (or is doing).I just can't understand why people want to introduce so much complexity into something that doesn't need to scale to Amazon or Facebook or Netflix levels of traffic.Can someone please educate me on the merits of a 'cloud native' architecture over a normal monolithic one when you need to serve a maximum of 100k requests per day?;"[deleted]#Cloud can be thought of as a moniker for running on rented hardware.  Cloud native is a newer term that means software which is built to be horizontally scalable, able to run in untrusted environments (e.g., data is encrypted in transit and at rest, use of HSM modules), and runs as ""Cattle"" not ""pets"", e.g., you can kill one off and easily replace it with another if need be, no one instance of it is critical for the survival of the system and finally that systems can tolerate distribution and network faults (able to self-heal, etc).  Most websites and content does not need to be ""cloud native"", most systems don't.  But for larger scale enterprises these concepts are gaining momentum.#but is it worth the added complexity? isn't there a minimum requirement that must be met for going for that instead of making 'hello world's?#Ok. I get what you're saying. And I for the most part don't have a problem with my provider providing a variety of services (like AWS provides tons of different services).One of the issues I have with 'cloud native' is that 'serverless' goes hand in hand. And I actually find these kinds of design paradigm often lead to unnecessary additional complexity that can be removed by using traditional methods and design patterns. More often than not, there is no visible advantage to going 'serverless' with 'microservices' yet the visible complexity stares you in the face.My problem starts when I'm forced to use microservices and serverless and what not for a project that will only serve a minuscule amount of requests per day (on the order of 1000) because management (and other programmers) heard a shiny new word and the big named companies using it and are convinced it's the solution written by the gods (or God).#> the physical security, hardware upgrades / maintenance and server availability to the cloud provider.That's a lot of complexity. That's the complexity of no longer needing to do that in your office and having someone on sight to handle hardware. Avoid planning ahead, ""How many people do we need to support, and therefore how much hardware do we need to buy?"" Buying hardware is *expensive*. Planning to buy hardware is expensive.With cloud services, you rent hardware, maintenance, uptime, support, lessons learned, logging, alerts, backups, and so many things from cloud providers. When starting small, the cost is free or very little. When getting big, the cost is big, but still less than the cost of doing it yourself (almost definitely).There's a huge community around it both supporting and creating.https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/03/08/introducing-the-cloud-native-landscape-2-0-interactive-edition/> Kohn and other key members of the CNCF have been very careful over the last few years to avoid imposing a top-down approach to cloud-native standards.https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/definition> Stop what you're doing and text ten of your colleagues. Ask them to define the term ""Cloud Native"". Good chance you'll get ten different answers.https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/cloud-native-computing/> Cloud native architectures take full advantage of on-demand delivery, global deployment, elasticity, and higher-level services. They enable huge improvements in developer productivity, business agility, scalability, availability, utilization, and cost savings.> On-demand delivery, taking minutes instead of weeks, is often the first reason that people move to cloud, but it doesn’t just reduce the deployment time for a traditional application: it also enables a new cloud native pattern of ephemeral and immutable deployments. In the old deployment model, where it takes weeks to get a resource, you’re going to hang on to it, order extra capacity in advance, and be reluctant to give it back, so you’ll figure out how to update it in place. Pick what fits for your needs. The cloud providers give you tools. Pick the tools you require.If you want to deploy a monolith onto Cloud Provider X, they will automatically deploy for you an [insert flavor] of Linux at the click of a button, you can pick a type of hardware and network to support, where you can SSH in and install whatever you want, and you may run it through their web user interface, along with any of the other cloud services you require from them, e.g. logging, alerts, etc.#I'm all for AWS services.But, where I work, 'cloud native' means 'AWS Lambda is our lifeblood'. People are more than willing to whip up a hundred lambda functions to do what can be done with one application. The maintenance burden boggles my mind yet other people seem to ignore all of that.#OK.You've changed your question from, ""What is cloud native and why do people use it?"" to ""My co-workers appear to mis-use cloud native, how do I help them understand this?""Then that's a conversation and/or education you need to have with your co-workers over time."
bioinformatics;hlq2yh;1593968874.0;/r/bioinformatics/comments/hlq2yh/pivoting_into_bioinformatics_with_a_physics_and/;Pivoting into Bioinformatics, with a Physics and Finance background. Should I do a Masters?;I currently work for a large financial firm in a financial anayst/data engineer hybrid role. I also have a PhD in physics. I'm beginning to explore the possibility a career change.   I have a lot of experience with data science work, big data sets & significant experience as a database architect. However I haven't studied any Biology since highschool.  If I was to pursue a career change into Bioinformatics is the next (big) logical step to take a MSc Bioinformatics?   I'm trying to keep this short, but some additional background info if it helps: My passion is very much in data science but with an application towards a more meaningful discipline (and Biology tops my short list). Long term I could see myself working in academia again or a role geared towards research.  It would be over a year before I would even begin an MSc and before then I plan on performing further reading and some online learning modules in this area. I also like the idea of using the MSc as a career pause to explore a new subject.   Any advice or other related tips would be very welcome.   I've read most of the FAQ and I believe this question is niche enough to require a new post, but appologies if I've missed something.;I think a lot of pharma and biotech companies will want experienced data engineers. Academia would also love having you, if you’re willing to take the massive pay cut. You could prepare by taking courses or reading textbooks on sequence alignment, variant calling, etc - the fundamental problems in bioinformatics. Also, some understanding of the technology behind DNA sequencing would be very useful - short read vs long read, quality metrics, exome vs whole genome. You should know the central dogma of biology by heart. I have another suggestion - instead of biology, what about healthcare? It is similarly meaningful, but would probably be more similar to the types of analyses you’re used to. You wouldn’t need as much domain knowledge of genomics, and you’d probably have more direct impact on people’s lives.#I know lots of physicists who got into proteomics. The sequencing technology is mass spectrometry based.#I have a PhD in physics and went straight to a postdoc.  Just did some directed self-learning and picked stuff up as I went.  Found a PI through word of mouth who was happy to hire a physicist.  It's hard to find a good postdoc.  I had no biology background (like I didn't know how DNA worked), and almost no statistics background, and I had to learn a programming language or two but I knew how to program.#In my opinion, it is based on which country you are in, I would say it's worth doing a Masters in Bioinformatics when you are interested in it.#Also, looks like you’re in the U.K. From what I’ve seen online, pharma/biotech salaries in the U.K. are very low. That info comes from the comments on a Derek Lowe post, you should really read up on him since he is one of the few writing from an industry insiders perspective in pharma.#I find your response to be very insightful but I want to know examples of positions in the healthcare scope you think will suit someone with such qualifications.#Thank-you for the response! I’m definitely considering this move (should I do it) to be a complete lifestyle change, including a fairly significant salary reduction. I’m pretty good at the data engineering side but it’s the data science that I really enjoy. I don’t mind the engineering as a means to and end, I.e. getting at / storing the data that I use. But my heart’s just not in it as a career in of itself. Anyway, thanks again - you’ve given me a great starting point for further research.#Interesting! Thanks for the input#Thank-you for this. I’ll definitely start reading. Think I’ve found the post you’re referring to :(#I have no idea since I don’t work in healthcare - I’m in biology. But there are positions across the board, from big hospital chains to startups to nonprofits to academic universities. Off the top of my head - Tempus is an example of a new but very well funded data forward healthcare company.#Of course. There’s also lots of room for camera development if you do optics, etc. Physicists are highly valuable doing instrument design if you aren’t too interested in doing the actual biological interpretation.

Is it correct?amazon basically develops their own spinoff of some apache tool and sells it as their own proprietary tool?;[deleted]#Are you asking if you can make your own AWS with blackjack and hookers? Yes you can. Will you ever have time to finish the blackjack and hookers? No.#Lots of what Amazon sells are the automation layers over free software. It's pretty strong automation though.#The difference between provisioning an EMR cluster with the components you need installed (a few clicks in the console or a single API call) and installing your own Hadoop cluster on your own machines is vast. And greater still if you are comparing running Spark jobs in a server less mode using Glue.One is something you can get going with and deliver some working ETL / jobs in a day, the other is a project in itself#This. A lot of what you get is not having to worry about maintenance, hosting, and having a team of specialized engineers on call around the clock.#No this is more like river water that the city already filtered into tap water and then a different company comes by and puts it in the bottles and sells at the people.The software that is free was made by other people and the foundation is already set it's just not as pretty sometimes. But then Amazon swoops in and says hey we can add a little bit of flair to this and sell this product for more#Exactly. MySQL RDS isn’t just MySQL. It’s multi master, multi site, automated failover, automated backups, with an API later over it you can use to manipulate it.#It would be hard for me to say that adding the service to its API, cloud formation, IAM integration and support, amongst several other things is just “flair.”#Saying AWS is just selling repackaged free software isn't true at all. Software can be free but infrastructure is not.#I would say what AWS does is quite a bit more than 'a little bit of flair'. They're building complex, robust services.  They provide all of the HW, all of the networking (VPC alone is mind-blowing), all of the DC infra, and they develop the SDKs to access of their services programmatically.If they use free low-level tools (Linux, Apache, etc.) to create these services, good on them.  Why reinvent ***that*** wheel?#Well I guess it's a bit downplayed to say flair.But I guess the main thing is that if Amazon is taking a free product it just seems a little unfair sometimes to be making money on it. But there is a lot that they do for a lot of their products that adds a lot of QOL.And I'm sure that they've come up with their own stuff by themselves as well. I mean AWS itself is their own child product#Yes. Infra, automation, configuration, best practices, high availability, all of it. You’re right.#> seems a little unfair sometimes to be making money on itIf the authors of a project are uncomfortable with the fact that cloud providers are profitting off of their work they should choose a different license for their code.I have zero sympathy for any project/team that chooses Apache/MIT/BSD licenses for growth reasons and then act indignant when others monetize their work.#You're forgetting a huge part of the equation though: hardware, networking, configuration, and scaling/high availability.Here's an example: https://aws.amazon.com/msk/In this case it's a FOSS product that they deploy and manage for you, and you don't have to think about buying hardware (or provisioning many VMs), configuring multiple nodes, and then adding to your cluster as your needs grow.In other cases, they add their special sauce because the underlying technology is often not designed to scale out of the box.

One is that seats are reserved for some programs whose students need it. Another is some students have enrolled in up to 6 courses!! If we de-enroll them at this point, they can enroll right back. The online system will not let us block them from specific courses as far as I understand. So we will release seats in August from the reserved ones if students from those programs do not enroll. As well we will freeze open enrollment and use waitlists to let in people. We cannot do that until all groups have had a chance to enroll themselves. Finally we are adding capacity to courses if the instructor will agree and hopefully this will alleviate the problem.#Yea I was planning on taking eecs 4404, but unfortunately, 4th years have an earlier enrollment time (and higher priority) than us 3rd years :( . Honestly just keep trying to enroll every day that's your best bet.#You shouldn't be worried, I'm sure you've heard about the waitlist right? They implement that so students who need classes the most get them. When the waitlist comes out you should be fine dont worry.#Apparently people who have earlier enrolment windows enrol in more than 1 section, so slots are taken up that easily.

It literally just has to be the graphs that I need help with, the rest I can figure out on my own.So, I am a pretty inexperienced programmer/developer or what you would call it and wanted to know if you guys had any (maybe beginner friendly) ressources for displaying real-time graphs.I have tried this thing called ""Epoch"" but I not sure if it is the right thing or if there are better solutions.Thanks in advance for all answers.";"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12764813/producing-a-live-graph-with-d3https://bost.ocks.org/mike/path/Does that help?#So like grafana?  🤔#Hey man, this is almost EXACTLY what I’m having to do at my first development job (display real-time graphs from sensors) and I was able to accomplish this use Vue, Vue-Axios, and Vue-Chartkick. Basically Vue-Chartkick just takes in any array or object that has distinct time values (in my case I use some built in js date methods) and a datapoint for each time point. In my case, every second, I make an API call to my sensors , in which I get a data object with the time stamp and data points for each sensor, I store the latest data point in a VueX store, and then bring it to my sensor display view and then split the given data object into multiple components for each sensor, inside each of the sensor components is where I put my graphs, now instead of placing these data points from the store straight into the charts, I actually make a new object in which I store the individual data point, this allows for me to adjust the size of that object (showing only 20 seconds vs 30 seconds) sorry for my rough explanation but if you need anymore help feel free to do me, as this is LITERALLY what I’m doing right now#That is what I was looking for, thank you!!!#1. Thank you! Didn't know this exists!2. Do you know if it can create graphs while data is being produced? I haven't seen it on the website and can only try it out tomorrow morning when I get back to the office. But this would be really cool.3. Thanks again!#Thank you very much!I will have to come back to you at a later point since I still kind of have to figure out how the system works.I am not sure if getting updates every seconds is enough since the sensors run at a much, much higher rate than 1 ""fps""(don't know what else to call it), eg. the eye-tracker produces like 240 lines in a CSV file per second.Also I, for now, have to reverse-engineer basically the entire system. All I currently have to work with is a bunch of already recorded data as CSV files, a crude web-interface that consists of like 10 buttons to toggle data recording on and off for each sensor and a display for the refresh rate of the sensors.I might get some better starting points from my supervisor but he is not in the office for the rest of the week, so maybe we already have a somewhat functioning system but I don't know.#It auto updates at configurable intervals. Your data has to come from a supported data source tho#ah, is there no backend or database that gets updated with the new values? Thats where I would pull from. Also, the interval with which you pull data is just set by putting the axios request in a SetInterval, which can go as fast as 1ms, which should be fast enough, depending on if your backend can send the request fast enough#Oh wow, that is pretty cool. Since MySQL databases are compatible I can probably figure out how to put the data there and then display it. Thank you very much, this is amazing!#Thank you! I have no idea yet on how the sensor data is handled yet and I probably have to create a backend myself. I will try this tomorrow if I get access to the documentation, but if I cannot figure out what you did, I'll probably just figure out a way to get the data into a database and then display it using Grafana.#Go thank the grafana devs  )"

I'm from SP DISM, I think its good but maybe other IT courses from other schools are better. I really wouldnt know unless I graduate from all of them. Dont listen to stereotypes. If you want to know which course might be a good fit for you, ask ppl who are studying/ studied in the course, ask them for lecture notes and read them yourself. See if thats what you want to study#Disclaimer: vague definition of big data = data that cannot fit into typical RAMI am not from a polytechnic and therefore won't recommend any, but take note that Big Data needs storage. I am confident enough to predict that **the** **school will struggle with provisioning enough resources** for a streamlined experience in learning Big Data if the program is new **unless they have an insane budget** or have someone that actually can operate in AWS/Azure with IAM management for students.In terms of learning big data, cloudxlab will out-perform most school resources in Singapore for their price point\~ Sure their content is average, but hey its \~$130 for an environment to play with big data (comes with a certificate too).One last thing: Don't jump on bandwagons. Maybe 10 years down the road small data is everywhere\~#I am currently from Temasek Poly IT school and would like to clear something up about Big Data and Analytics (BDA). It is actually a merger of two previous courses  BIA (Business Intelligence and Analytics) & Big Data Management and Governance. It is actually a rather good course now as you would be dealing a lot with data and numbers. It would be extremely useful for the future but, this course would require a lot of critical thinking and analysis.As for recommendations, I am sorry but, I am not able to recommend you some as I have not much idea about it.As advice from someone going through an IT- related course, it is something that you really need the passion for. I know people who do not like IT and are suffering from their projects and, the coding stress is not something that can be easily tolerated, you need a lot of experience. You are not expected to have prior knowledge about coding and programming as you would be taught the basics, the rest would be left to you. Expect a lot of independent learning when you are in an IT course and a lot of your answers to be from youtube or google. It would definitely be more or less useful for the future but, you cannot stop learning. As IT is something that is constantly evolving, if you stick to only one framework, one language, you would be ancient! You would need a lot of initiative in your work.If you are confused to which side of IT you would like to go, you can join in common programmes. TP has one and from there, you can find out which part of IT you like.  Hope to see you doing IT!#Sp (Ai and data science)#Alright thx, will do that#Yeah, I've heard of cloudxlab.

chch;hwz9uo;1595585857.0;/r/chch/comments/hwz9uo/remain_for_year_13_or_head_straight_for_uc/;Remain for Year 13 or head straight for UC;Hi Christchurch,I am a British Jaffa. I am in Year 12, and doing Cambridge AS Levels and an A Level. This basically allows me to gain University Entrance this year AND I can also satisfy the pre-requisites for all first-year papers as well in my degree of BE(Hons) specialising in Software Engineering.My family and I are however finding it extremely hard to decide whether for me to go straight to UC next year to start my 4-year BE(Hons), or to remain in Year 13 to complete my Cambridge A-Levels and a Maths paper through STAR which would then allow me to go straight to Year 2 BE(Hons). I have talked to UC and they introduced me to this discretion - there seems to be no info about it on their website.As a British, I am an international student in NZ so either way would cost my family the same (around $43k) next year, but if I choose the latter option of remaining in Year 13 I can apply for a one-off scholarship of $15k.I don't want to remain in Year 13 because the problem is the offer to go straight to Year 2 BE(Hons) from Year 13 is not a firm promise from UC so there is uncertainty here. If I remain for Year 13 and then do not get the discretion that means I'll have to delay by one year and pay an additional amount of $43k. Which is huge.But I don't want to leave school either. I have been offered to be, starting from next year, a Peer Support, a House Exec, the Chair of the Student Council Board, and be the UN Youth Ambassador to the School, I also have plans to set up a club at my school that would comprise of enthusiasts in cloud stuff e.g. VPS, hosting, domain, IPv6, Big Data, Azure, Data Science etc. These are really big offers and if they can gain me discretion into Year 2 BE(Hons) I may also be granted a scholarship that could save us a staggering amount of $15k.As a 17-year-old attending uni if I go with the first option, I do expect to really miss lots of social lives but then come Year 2 when I also turn 18 and have three more years to complete, as people from other 3-year degrees would also be. I'll also catch up with friends at the same age as me then who would also graduate at the same time as me.My parents are divided on this issue. Daddy wants me to remain at school while Mum is very strong on her choice for uni. I find myself conflicted.What do you think? How would you personally choose in my case? Are there any of you here who have granted the discretion to enter Year 2 BE(Hons) from UC before??;Are you really an international student - you should check that carefully.  I would say you will learn more in year 13 doing clubs and extra curricular activities than you will at Uni.  Academic achievement is likely a given for you,  so, as an employer,  I would strongly suggest staying for year 13 and having a good time doing interesting things.#You definitely shouldn’t underestimate the value of starting university at a time when you’re old enough to really get stuck into the social side. I had friends in my first year at UC that had either skipped year 13 or just been put up a year and they couldn’t come to many O-week events or clubs events because so many of them were held at bars or just had enough alcohol present that they weren’t allowed to admit people under 18.I started at UC not really knowing anyone else doing my degree, and being able to meet people at o week or meet and greet events was so important for my social wellbeing, as was things like going to BYOs and bars with my friends outside of lectures. It can be quite hard to just meet people in lectures or at the library so those club events (Ensoc bbqs etc) are really key for getting to know the other people in your courses.I also think the stuff you’ve got coming up next year at school will be great opportunities for you to grow and get some different experience. The academic part of your journey is important but so equally is the social and extra-curricular side of it.Personally I would wait another year. Doing so won’t put you behind. You could also speak with the academic advisors at UC to get some further assurance that your STAR courses would allow you to go straight to 200-level papers. The UC website is notoriously difficult to navigate so I wouldn’t worry about the info not being on there. Just get in touch with them again and try and get them to put something in writing (like by sending you an email.)#Stay for year 13. I think you are overestimating the risk of not getting direct entry to 2nd year. Given your background its pretty unlikely you would be declined if you continue to get good results.#Stay in school, you seem to like it there and you won't get another chance to have those experiences. You can start uni anytime - and if you're eligible for direct entry to second year this year, you surely will be next year too.I would only encourage you to drop out if you really hated life at school.Plus being 17 at uni does suck lol, believe me I've been there.#id take the no risk approach of starting uni a year early if you think you can handle it#I didn't stay for year 13 and went straight to uni. I wish I had stayed for year 13#If you spend less time at uni by staying and doing year 13 then stay there. International costs for papers (classes) are sometimes insane. It could cost me a domestic student 800 per class but for you 3000. You do a max of 4 papers each semester, with 2 each a year. Max total of 8. Although once you hit 3rd year uni classes you can take larger classes that are worth more ( but have a harder workload). So if you did the 1st year minimum of 8 in 1st year thats 3000x8= $24,000 a year with an additional $750 student levy fee per year of study. So almost 25k a year for you. If you intend to leave the country rather than stay, that will increase due to interest. However if you stay and live in nz it wont gather interest. Im in my 5th year at uni and over 50k in debt and at this point i couldn't give more of a fuck on how high it is because ive given up on caring. But def try and save wherever you can. (Btw i did a BA in sociology + honours not an engineering degree)#This is coming from an engineering student. SKIP THE INTERMEDIATE YEAR. It is honestly such a draining and unmotivating experience. You do nothing immediately related to your field and it's all preparation for the 'real' courses. You will miss out on social aspects of uni life if you aren't 18, it's true. Even if you don't drink, a lot of the club events require you to be 18.#That sucks but do not go to university if you can’t get into a bar - the first year of Uni is where you make your mates, do fun things and... drink a lot lol - I had a friend who did what you did and he dropped out after the first year because he just failed on the social side of things. Finish Yr13, start Uni with your peers!

The role of the Data & Analytics Lead would be to:* To define, own and implement a group-wide data strategy and ensure the strategic vision for data architecture is met and maintained by working with the CEO (in line with their 3-year strategic vision) and a range of Stakeholders including Department Heads, Managers and Support Workers.* To develop and promote a central database architecture that aids the organisation in achieving its strategic goals* Work with various teams throughout the organisation to provide analysis and valuable insights to unlock opportunities, drive data-informed business decisions and to make a positive impact on our service users.# Key Objectives/Responsibilities**Infrastructure*** Partner with leadership and peers to understand report requirements, map and document existing business processes, evaluating output requirements and formats and ensure consistency across teams* Implement and administer the large CRM database initiative and provide database user support.&#x200B **Analysis*** Effectively use data to tell stories, communicate key insights through internal reports, presentations and dashboards to drive business decisions.* Define and share key business performance indicators with the leadership team.* Analysis of our customer and donor base to help our retail and fundraising teams understand our supporters.* Help get the most out of our website, content and social platforms - by understanding and helping in the optimization of customer journeys and marketing/advertising campaign performance&#x200B **Management*** Help to drive the data strategy group-wide.* Work with the with leadership & management teams across the group to understand their requirements & data sources, set priorities based on analysis and results to implement and optimise fundraising, impact and commercial processes and solutions* Work with the leadership teams to build dashboards and KPI monitoring reports for providing insights to enable better planning and performance monitoring across the organisation.* Work closely with various teams within the organisation to gain a holistic view of customers, trends and competitors\----I appreciate that this may be asking a lot from one person, especially on a low/mid-range salary but it is what we need and all we can afford. I'm hoping that it will be a great working experience for the person taking the role who will see it as an opportunity to develop their role and get their feet wet in a senior data position. With that, there will also be patience and expectation for a lot of on the job learning, that this will be a long process and the person filling the role won't magically be able to implement/fix everything listed above within their first year in the role. We see this as a two-year+ journey to data maturity.&#x200B **What are the bare minimum technical/non-technical skills/knowledge I should be looking for?**&#x200B Also for extra context the organisation is 6 years old, and is looking to implement salesforce but does not have a CRM/central database yet. &#x200B Thank you!;[deleted]#I dont think a junior would be right for the kind of responsibilities you have planned for this role.  How can you expect a junior to drive the data strategy of your whole organisation? If you really want these outcomes to be achieved successfully, you need someone who’s had experience in 2-3 companies for probably 4-5 years, at the very least.Why is the salary low for this position? Is it the case with all other heads of departments or just this one? Seeing that the market for data folks is pretty vibrant in most places, and the salaries high, i doubt anyone who is well qualified for this role would go for what is universally recognized as a « low salary ».Whats the salary you have in mind and whats the location of your company?#I would expect there to be emphasis on Data Management practices. Data Governance, knowledge of data owners/stewards/consumers.#You're lumping data governance, management and analytical roles plus some IT into one role...that's going to be some big scope. Does this cross other area's that may be doing some of this work already?&#x200B I would very much recommend you hire a person with as much experience as you can - not a new graduate with a PhD for example, because you want someone who has experience here across multiple area's. FYI - you're very likely to get all of this in one person, and even if they are, they'll need a large support team underneath them. &#x200B Are you part of techsoup for not for profits where you can leverage the cloud tools at a discount? Having someone who understands not for profits as well as the commercial side will be hard as well.#Thank you for your feedback.Can you give any examples of what some of the biggest causes of conflict that you mentioned were? What sort of expectations had been given to the department heads which were difficult to achieve? Due to the lack of data maturity across the board, I want to make sure I can help strike the balance between a motivating data strategy/vision to bring the department heads on the journey to a shifting culture/way of working while also making sure it's achievable with realistic expectations.&#x200B The biggest datasets will be several 100k rows. Aside from R / Python are there any other technical skills you think would be most suitable for that size? I don't feel like it would really be entering the big data specialist category but I'm not sure?&#x200B Also, what was it that made the company decide they needed to bring you in and what services did you provide? Did the person working before maintain their position with your support or was their role changed?#£40k, in the UK. Still a high salary for the charity sector but low compared to what people would be earning as a 'head of data' in places like London. Aside from the experience (and point noted on that), what are the key skills you think would be needed?#Great, thanks for your feedback! What about on the technical side of the data processing, python, SQL etc?#If a Head of Data & Analytics would be earning 40k in London I wonder what the more junior employees are paid#What are other roles making in your industry? Eg. Head of marketing, Head of technology/Lead engineer, Head of sales.#Regarding question on skills: Ability to understand the bigger picture in the business, having the required technical skills as it pertains to databases, programming and BI, ability to communicate with clarity the impact and outcomes of analytics projects, ability to influence decision making in the company... these skills are expensive. Im an intermediate data engineer in montreal (not a very high paying city) with 2 years experience, and i wouldnt consider myself qualified for the role you have described. I make twice the amount you have in mind.#SQL or NoSQL would be fine. Other coding languages would be an advantage.  I would expect them to know about data structures and be able to confidently give examples of when they have created one. (Warehouse, lakes etc.)Knowledge and experience in reading and creating database schemas. It would be paramount for them to be to explain this to other non technical stakeholders.Then you have to make sure that all your data is secure and gdpr compliant. A question you may be asked is what is your current stack, and what is your budget for new staff / services (physical servers, clouds etc.)Thats just for the data management side / database owner.On the other side you mention wanting analytics is there already business intelligence software that you are using? Would the candidate be required to do the analytics in excel for example? If excel, then you want someone who is able to use VBA. If they're used to using Powerbi or Tableau that may be another business expense. (Including user licence cost.)Is your data already modelled? Does it need cleansing? If it requires manual remediation then you may need to bring in temps for this for cheap work to fix. If I was a potential candidate, there would be so many different questions that would need answering for me to consider.  It may be worth breaking this down into two sections. DBO/ Data Management (30-40k) & Data Analysis (22k-28k)If you have any questions then feel free to pm, I can help where I can and if I dont know the answer, Ill be able to point you to the right place.#Just to clarify, I'm in the UK but not based in London. I was just making the comparison as £40k is a decent salary for small-mid charity but someone could be paid double that if they wanted to do a similar role in London.
Accounting;horahc;1594396015.0;/r/Accounting/comments/horahc/unhappy_with_job_is_it_worth_talking_to_my_boss/;Unhappy with job - Is it worth talking to my Boss?;Some backstory - started this job beginning of February, just a bit before COVID hit.  I was at a small public firm beforehand which I enjoyed, but which was falling apart (3 people quit in 4 months) and was moving to more H&R block softwares which I didn't want to be a part of (didn't think it was good experience).  So I moved to a big industry job doing income tax on a small team.I really had no idea what to expect as this industry position is the first ever in industry for me.  Needless to say it hasn't been at all what I expected.  I've been pretty unhappy and unsure of what I'm doing during my time here.  I'm not sure what I'm learning but I'm aware I haven't been here long and it takes time to settle in. COVID came along about 1 month into the job and we started working from home which only exacerbated the issues.  My hour-long commute was gone and there was flexibility in what I was doing.  However, the company has a VERY strict no work from home policy and we've been back at the office now for the past month (they never wanted us to go home in the first place).So now I'm at a loss of what to do, mainly, do I have a discussion with my boss about my unhappiness?  There's really nothing he could do about the commute, about the flexibility/WFH.  I'm not sure what he'd do either about the work itself and it's hard for me to pinpoint what exactly the issue is I have with the work. Part of it feels like familiarity with the job, but I also know I miss actually doing returns, reviewing financials, and interacting with small business owners.  Things here feel so large scale and big data, I enjoyed small projects I could accomplish frequently.  I feel like a cog in the machine here without much impact.I've been working with a recruiter trying to find another small firm to go to with the hopes of keeping a similar salary and getting a senior title but that has been slow.&#x200B So what do you think?  Do I talk to my boss and voice this stuff? Is it even worth it if I have no solutions in mind?;I’m in a very similar situation, it’s been especially hard learning a new job remotely and the work isn’t as appealing as I expected. I just called my old boss and I’m going back to my previous firm. Not sure if this is the best long term solution but I know I’ll be happier with that than my industry job. Hope you figure out what’s right for you!#>Do I talk to my boss and voice this stuff?This is a difficult question, because it very much depends on what kind of person your boss is. Open-minded bosses who care about their staff will be willing and able to discuss this, and may be able to help you in some way. Close-minded bosses who view their employees as nothing more than tools to get their job done will penalize you for bringing this up. Most bosses lie somewhere on the spectrum between those two extremes.  We can't tell you what kind of boss you have. You may not even know what kind of boss you have, if you've only been there a few months and half of that time has not been in-person.>Is it even worth it if I have no solutions in mind?If you knew you had a very open-minded, conscientious boss, *or* if you had concrete suggestions, I'd say yes, talk to them. But if you're uncertain about your boss being conscientious, it might not be a great idea to go to them with nothing but vague complaints of being dissatisfied. Some bosses would interpret that as a sign that you're not interested in doing the job anymore, and will start pulling back from you in anticipation of you leaving... which usually guarantees that you leave, one way or the other.Frankly, how open you can be about this should probably depend on what your alternative job prospects are like, and how much of a financial safety net you have. If you have a boss that interprets your complaints as a sign you're on the way out anyway, and then your company decides to do a round of layoffs, that's the end for you. That's probably not something you want to be dealing with unless you have a lot of savings or family members to support you, as the job market is not exactly booming right now.#I'd love to hear an update on going back to the old firm.  What were the details of this?  My new job came with a pretty sizable pay increase.  Did your new job come with a raise?  Did you have to take a paycut to go back to the old job?  Has it been awkward going back? How big was your old firm?#I agree.  Keep it close to your vest and keep working with your recruiter.  Its a tough market if you lose your job.#I didn’t have a huge pay increase when I changed jobs so that definitely helped. When I talked to my old boss though he did ask what my thoughts were on salary when I returned so there was definitely an opportunity for negotiating higher pay. It’s cheaper for a company to hire you back at a higher rate than hire someone new and have to go through all the training and learning curves again. My old firm was 30 people. I haven’t gone back yet since I had to give 2 week notice but I had talked to a friend there before deciding to go back and from what I can tell everyone’s excited to have me back. Hopefully it’ll be a smooth transition returning. It definitely depends on the people at your old office and the relationship you had with them.#Makes sense.. My concern would be around salary.  I went from 57 to 72 with this jump and I doubt they'd be able to pay that.  Maybe my salary expectations are just unrealistic for a firm as small as I'm looking for.#Yeah it would be hard to go back that much in pay for sure. I guess what you should expect depends on years of experience and if you have a cpa but if you like the work better in public you could always look at different firms. I think 72k for 3-4 years of experience is completely reasonable at a small firm#ya 4 years now with CPA for 2.5.. started at that firm at 52 and got no raises except for the CPA because of various reasons.  I've been trying to land a senior position at a small firm.. Just need to give it more time I guess.Thanks for your responses, they've been helpful!#Yeah definitely! A lot of public firms are on hiring freezes right now so it might just be your timing but most firms would probably love someone with your background - you could probably end up making even more than your current salary too. I have heard though that larger firms (big 4) that hire seniors from small firms hire them as experienced staff, don’t know if that would matter to you. Good luck!

Bad job ads always make me angry.Here it goes:    Senior Software Engineer (Java)    [...]    We are looking for senior developers that are extremely conscientious and know    how to take E2E responsibility and with this have complete ownership over their    code. We are offering a rare opportunity for developers to gain a holistic view    in IT from the design all the way to production [...]That's already a strong start but it gets better.    Technical Skills    - Confident in, and frequently uses the TDD cycle.    - Demonstrate a good understanding of SOLID and how to apply it.    - Automates everything by default and can/has built and managed a CI/CD pipeline.    - Demonstrate a good knowledge of programming languages other than JAVA &    paradigms by knowing when to apply them.    - Has implemented critical path components in a large or complex project.    - Demonstrates in depth knowledge of IDE.    - Demonstrable experience working within Agile teams.    - Comfortably debugs/finds complex problems.    - Writes secure code by default and understands server hardening.

bigdata;hlfvyf;1593919243.0;/r/bigdata/comments/hlfvyf/big_data_projects/;Big data projects?;Hello All! I'm kinda bored with my day job (doing Data Engineering there too) and looking for some fun projects to fill my time with. I currently have 5 laptops (4CPU + 16GB of RAM each) all set up with docker swarm, and I don't pay for electricity. I primarily use PostgreSQL + Python + Dask for working with big data projects professionally, so I'd wanna work with those tools, but I'm willing to expand if possible (I have worked with Spark, but not a ton of success there because the tools I was using professionally weren't as good with Dask) . I'm kinda curious about working on ML/AI projects for a while now, but I've had no place to start working on them. My ideal goal would be to create an ML pipeline that streams data from a source every day/hour/minute, pre-process them, re-train the ML model, then show me results on a dashboard. I was planning on using something like Prefect or Airflow to learn how to use them for this project, but it's not a hard requirement. I prefer projects with a ton of data to try and find ways to optimize it to get it working on a limited system. My internet is spotty AF too, so it'd be more fun to work with. Overall, I wanna try and find more big data projects to work on, so suggestions are appreciated!;Hey man, I'm just graduated from college and have been getting into data science. I have been looking to do something similar as well, get into getting an ML project up and running but not necessarily dynamic.

I documented my details here: https://diybigdata.net/personal-compute-cluster-2019-edition/#Hell yeah man. I think I know plenty of tech to work on stuff. What projects do you have in mind?#So what I have been thinking is a project that would help me develops skills all around a core ML component that could be predictive on a website using flask. So my first idea was getting started with web scraping off of Twitter and then diving into NLP to do sentiment analysis. Thinking of how this could be dynamic actually gets me excited. Theoretically you could have a component that could analzye a hashtag for sentiment analysis. This has probably already been done considering the marketing value.#I was thinking about doing the same thing last night!Here's my plan for it:- query the Twitter api for all recent hash tags- for each hashtag, get the top 100 tweets + most liked retweets- store in a mongodb (better because we're getting the json datatype as response)- using dask bags and text blobs, run sentiment analysis for each topic and response- return the results to whatever dashboard I needWhat do you think about this? It's fairly simple in my eyes, so I didn't bother too much with it, but I might want to try it out now#I'm so down. I'll dm you.

Over Diversication?;[deleted];"Normally we don't approve question self-posts, as they're what the daily and weekly threads are for, but this is a pretty novel question that I don't remembering seeing before.Approved for now.#It's an interesting topic, but your example (Sears) failed not primarily due to of over-diversification, but rather because it doubled-down on retail after the internet brought new competition. In other words, it focused on being Walmart while ignoring Amazon. Sure, diversification didn't help them focus on their core competency, but their focus was arguably short-sighted to begin with.The vertical integration aspect primarily benefits Tesla's core business (auto and energy). Insurance would also benefit the auto directly, especially if/when FSD and robotaxis become a thing.There are plenty of companies that have diverse focus and somehow seem to manage:* Berkshire-Hathaway. While might seem to be aware that they own Geico, Fruit of the Loom and HH Brown Shoe, they also own NetJets, Dairy Queen, Pampered Chef, FlightSafety Intl, Acme Building, Duracell, several newspapers, and hundreds of other brands outright- not to mention large stakes in many other businesses. Yes, they're a holding company today, but they originally started out as a clothing company.* Amazon: Surprisingly to many, the profit from its online retail site pales in comparison to AWS- which generates the majority of its earnings. While Prime Video might not outcompete Netflix, it doesn't need to- Netflix pays nearly $10M a month for AWS. Amazon also owns Twitch, Whole Foods, IMDb, Audible, and more. Did you know Star Citizen uses Amazon Lumberyard game engine? Like Musk's other companies, Jeff Bezos has personally branched out separately with Blue Origins and Washington Post.* General Electric: GE is my primary counterpoint to the over-diversification, since this same argument was used by sell-side analysts to attack the stock after Jack Welch retired. His successor somehow drank this ""over-diversified"" koolaid, leading to a firesale of a lot of brands- many of which were seeing promising growth.I could go on, since there's numerous other companies with diversely-themed portfolios, but I thought I'd just share the notable counterexamples.#Software isn't a buisness in se, just upgrade the experience. Developing a Semi is normal for an Auto company. Never heard of House financing. Other things just help the mission. If Tesla was for example doing an HVAC system, then we could talk about overdiversification.#Sears falling victim to retailpocalypse is a lot different than what Tesla is doing. If Tesla continues their core philosophy of innovating as fast as possible they won't go anywhere. Their verticals are all interconnected and make a lot of sense.#I think they're being careful about this, which is why they're not jumping into mining right now.  Sears was diversified a LONG time ago -- even shipping pre-built houses in the 30s.  They got wiped out by the internet, pure and simple.  Tesla is embracing -- leading -- in the adoption of cutting-edge technology.   Apples and oranges, imho.#Ground source heat pumps are a major innovation in renewable energy. The adoption of renewables would greatly accelerate if there was a.cheap way of implementing this tech. Surprisingly the model Y heat pump is a pretty sweet low cost step in this direction."
apachespark;hkx90v;1593836334.0;/r/apachespark/comments/hkx90v/is_it_good_practice_to_query_a_database_when/;Is it good practice to query a database when streaming with Spark;Hello, I am trying to make a simple streaming app with Spark. Input is a Kafka topic that holds some product info, and before I write this product info to somewhere else, I want to get category info of product and add to my model during streaming. I am planning to store my product-category mapping data in a PostgreSQL table, or in a Couchbase bucket. So I need to query one of these for every stream data. What I want to learn is:\- Is it applicable in Spark?\- Is it a good practice for streaming apps? If not, how can I achieve doing this with a big-data way? Should I store my mapping data somewhere else?Thanks in advance.;This is definitely possible in Spark. If reference is static and less in size preferred to cache and do the look up. In case if it's not small, then better to refer a datastore that has low latency response time. Long story short YES you can do it!!#I´ve seen this with redis and memcache.#This is generally a bad idea in production. If the query fails or is unreasonably delayed your streaming’s process will fall behind and possibly fail. For this use case you’d typically want a streaming co-join, but you’d have to modify the process populating the Postgres table to push updates out on a kafka stream.
homelab;i00cs4;1596027916.0;/r/homelab/comments/i00cs4/need_quality_of_service_guidance/;Need Quality of Service guidance;I have never done any QoS and need to learn it very soon. For the folks who work at ISP, ISP like or multi-tenant environment, how are you implementing bandwidth restriction to your clients or tenants?I have 3 tenants so far in a 10Gbps backbone network and I need to limit the upload and download of my tenants to the cloud providers. This is mostly big data file transfer and we want to limit the from FIFO free for all network into more define lets say 2Gbps to some tenants. Also, each tenant doesn't see each other. This is done via virtual-router (Junos) and VRF-lite (Cisco).The only thing I could think of is traffic shaping. I don't want to drop the clients' packets, so, I think, I have to use shaping instead of policing. The topology is     [tenant]---10g---[RTR]-----10g-----[RTR]---10g----[Internet]I really want to lab this on EVE-NG as soon as possible to get the some experience. I am really losing my mind on this QOS thing. I don't even know where to start.;"ISP's usually do two things.  1. They do a hierarchical QoS policy on each subscriber, both input and output.  The outer or parent queue is usually a shaper but sometimes a policer to set the max bandwidth for the subscriber.  The inner or child queues are matched depending on service.  Usually there is voice, video (for IPTV services), and generic internet.  Voice is usually a priority (ie interrupt queue) policed queue to something like 500k-1Mbps.  Video is a guaranteed bandwidth queue of something like 20-50Mbps.  Internet is a bandwidth-remaining queue of whatever is left.  Depending on the access technology, they also may mark 802.1p bits so the access layer can do ""core qos"" at strictly layer 2.  They also mark DSCP bits on the packets inbound to account for for voice, internet, or business class internet.2.  They do something similar in the core and access layers, but usually have 4 queues, voice, video (ie IPTV), residential internet, and business internet/services.  They don't do hierarchical QoS here and generally just do something like 10% bandwidth guaranteed for voice, 45% guaranteed for IPTV, 45% guaranteed for business, and residential gets whatever is left (although it is set up so that all 4 queues share whatever is left).  Also, the percentages will change depending on the provider and their data on what their services actually use.&#x200B Most of the equipment vendors also offer BNG (Broadband Network Gateway) functionality to automate #1 above (as well as other things) for access technology agnostic implementations (ie each customer is a VLAN on a router).#My understanding with shaping is, shaping can only be applied to outbound. This is another that confusing me. For option #1, if the business purchased a 1Gbps, the ISP would apply the shaper on the closest router to the customer. Then the outbound (to the backbone) interface will have this shaper policy as outbound and the same goes for the interface that facing the customer with outbound shaper policy. Am I correct on this one?I am working on Juniper MX and Cisco ASR routers.#Juniper MX and Cisco ASR (ASR9K?) can do shaping in both ingress and egress directions. These routers have massive amounts of queues and QoS capabilities, it is what they were designed for.  There is never a shaper for a customer on the backbone interfaces (ie ISP router to router interfaces), the policier/shaper is always placed on the customer facing interfaces (ie the interface that has the customer's default route IP address or some L2 interface in the access network).When talking about the MX and 9K, those routers are often the ""IP Edge"" or ""subscriber edge"" router, meaning that they contain the IP interface that is the customer default route.  So almost always they have the outbound QoS (policing/shaping) policy for the customer on them.  There are obvious exceptions here for Cable access, where the CMTS is the IP edge device.  This is done because the ISP doesn't want to place traffic onto the access network, which is often the most precious bandwidth they have, only to drop it later.  Where the inbound QoS is performed really depends on the last mile access.  You are correct that it is placed on the device as close to the customer as possible.  Place it on the IP router always works, but if it can be done in the access network, then it is done there.#Our routers are ASR1002-HX and MX480. I just joined the team and as far as I know we are not classifying any traffic. It seems like I don't have to do anything on the other routers other than the routers that connected to the customers.So in my case, to limit the customer to 1Gbps/1Gbps, I would be doing this both ingress and egress directions on the customer facing interface only?What about those VoIP or video traffic? I guess, I need to mark/classify these traffic closest to the source and create a policy to every router to treat these packets differently.The drop probability is another confusing thing. I don't even know how to ask a question about this.#"" It seems like I don't have to do anything on the other routers other than the routers that connected to the customers.""Correct&#x200B "" So in my case, to limit the customer to 1Gbps/1Gbps, I would be doing this both ingress and egress directions on the customer facing interface only?

I guess, I need to mark/classify these traffic closest to the source and create a policy to every router to treat these packets differently. ""Yes, you need to classify and mark traffic with DSCP/TOS/EXP bits on every ingress point into your network.  ie all peering links get residential internet marking, all your SIP gateway servers get voice marking, all your video servers get video marking, etc.&#x200B "" The drop probability is another confusing thing. I don't even know how to ask a question about this. ""You don't have drop probability.  You have a shaper with a defined queue depth.  Within the shaper, you have multiple queues and service them in a defined order.  If you exceed the queue depth, you drop packets.#>Correct.  The exception would be on the ingress (upload) direction from  the customer IF you have a device closer to the customer that can do it.What about when the customer starts downloading from let's say a file server at some university. University R&E uses this high bandwidth multi-threaded file transfer application that can do near line rate speed. Do I need to apply the shaping on the ingress direction on the Internet-facing interface? About the drop probability, I am confused about which one will get drop, for example, traffic marked as AF22 vs AF33. I believe, AF33 will get drop first before AF22 even though AF3x has a higher priority than AF2y. What about the packets marked with AF23 vs AF33 which one will get drop first.#"" What about when the customer starts downloading from let's say a file server at some university.

I believe, AF33 will get drop first before AF22 even though AF3x has a higher priority than AF2y. What about the packets marked with AF23 vs AF33 which one will get drop first. ""The routers are doing a form of Weighted Round Robin (WRR) usually using a form of token bucket, so they are servicing the queues (that you define) in a weighted order based on the bandwidth that you define.  For example, if you have 3 queues and assign then 25%, 25%, and 50% bandwidth  then it will service 1500 bytes from queues 1, then 1500 bytes from queue 2, then 3000 bytes from queue 3, then repeat.  The routers do not care about AF23 vs AF33 UNLESS you define your queues that way.  All packets are equal until you define a queue.  EXP/TOS/DSCP have no meaning until you define it.  The only exception is that the routers usually have a secret priority queue for router originated control traffic such as  ISIS, OSPF, PIM, ARP, BGP, BFD, etc, etc.  These packets that the router originates are placed into a system generated priority queue on the interface."

So I have an Excel workbook that has about 30 work sheets and on each sheet, the data category is in the same position (e.g name in cell B2, Salary in cell b15) - is there a way to quickly pull the data from each sheet onto one big data sheet where I can see all the data for each person? Surely there must be a quicker way than trawling through each sheet?Thanks in advance!;"What I would do is construct a summary sheet layout as the first sheet.|Name|Salary||:-|:-||(name to be copied down here)|(salary to be copied here)|Then record/write a macro that copies the required data from a worksheet to the summary sheet.  Then do a ""for"" loop that applies that macro across the other worksheets.Quick example that you can copy and adapt to your needs:    Sub Summarise()        'defines the variables    Dim WS_Count As Integer    Dim I As Integer        'counts the number of worksheets    WS_Count = ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets.Count        ' Begin the loop at 2    For I = 2 To WS_Count    Worksheets(1).Cells(I, 1).Value = Worksheets(I).Range(""B2"").Value    Worksheets(1).Cells(I, 2).Value = Worksheets(I).Range(""B15"").Value        Next I        End Subedited to put the VBA into a code block#What would be your ideel way of seeing the data? And how are the various sheets named?#Is there a reason why all that data is stored in excel in different tabs? It honestly sounds like you could just do a one time job and merge everything into a master sheet and call it a day. If you can't do that it's probably better to throw that data into a database or sharepoint list. If you can't do that because of legacy reasons (everyone in my company uses this and it has to stay like this) then You can create a new excel file and use power query to pull all the data and manipulate it to your liking.#It appears you posted VBA code in plain text instead of using the code-block.

Could you expand on why you recommend that over the 3600? Thanks for the advice!#3300x has more or less the same performance since it has less cores its just worse at workloads like video editing but gaming cant really use many cores and you save the money from it#Mainly because I own it myself and take pride in that lol, but also because it's cheaper and im assuming your friend isn't using this computer as a workhorse and mostly casual, its a bit cheaper while providing excellent performance. the 3600 is better overall and might be a better option like you mentioned earlier for the cpu intensive tasks, but im pretty confident that the cheaper 3300x would suffice.

I completed my undergraduate in computer science about a year back and took up this job for a year because I wanted to work with web development for a while even when I know that web dev is most certainly on its way out and within my lifetime(i am 22).I applied for a masters in big data analytics last fall and have got the admit this year, I know I enjoy tinkering with data and I have a vague idea that I will enjoy ""predictions"" with data as part of my job.I am wondering if data analytics as a job would be made redundant since GPT3 can basically predict stuff if data is fed to it. Now, what kind of data is fed to it still depends on the programmers but I think not a lot of programmers are actually required, probably just the cream, not the average data analyst.";"Data Analyst is still an effusive term. Usually it refers to someone who makes a lot of SQL queries, organizes the storage of data, does some simple analysis and communicate it, so I will adopt this definition. I haven't seen how GPT-3 performs writing SQL (I hope it does it well, because boy how I hate it), but I can perfectly see GPT-3 being able to draw some basic visualizations. The ability of organizing and obtaining data requires knowledge of specific domains, so I think these are tasks that won't be quickly automated.I don't think that this is reason enough to discourage you from pursuing a career with which you have affinity, though. IT jobs are not very dissimilar, so you can jump to another tree when the fire comes.#lol definitely notSource: works as data engineer for a team of data scientists#I mean someone still needs to understand the underlying data and request the visualizations regardless of method of creation.

That's not a very clever question.You will ask a bazillion questions. ""What is the race makeup of the customers. Where do my customers live. How much do they spend.""Then you'll ask it to make your reports.""Plot a histogram showing unique purchases by month.""And your analysis.""Give me the probability that decreasing the price 10% will increase revenues by 7% or more.""You will be responsible for managing this tool. You will be more productive, which means there will be fewer data scientist jobs but they will have better pay.But your career isn't going away.#Yea, only the cream would remain in the data analyst/data scientist jobs and the rabid demand for it would decrease significantly#Alternatively, unemployed data scientist would lower their prices and smaller firms would get interested in hiring them.Maybe you'd end up doing data science for a specific region of convenience stores or a highschool basketball team.I really think this is only going to improve data science opportunities... but only for people that can use the new tools."

They're so relatable and it's nice to see so many reaching out trying to deal with the same thing.  I might have something to add, I think. Because last year I went through a *bit* of a work-related existential crisis myself:p.First of all, some of you will probably benefit from [80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org/)' career advice. They're an Oxford-related research institute that helps people figure out how to make the most of the +/-80,000 hours of their working life, and the resources on their site are exceptionally rich. It helped me a lot in making sense of what a career actually is!Now, to last year. When I started a job at an ethics-of-technology (sort of) think tank, I thought it was perfect for me. I would help set up a new way of communicating privacy-information with icons. I would make developments in big-data research accessible to our readers online. I would help create a new model for looking at the human-tech relationship. Anyhow, it soon became apparent that I only had the tiniest bit of a say in how my projects turned out. Every idea, every draft had to go through a committee of at least five experts (sometimes 'experts', rather) and by the time it got published and everyone had had their say it would be a monstrosity spliced from many opinions and stakes.That took away all my motivation, to the point where I'd cried several times at work. I even got a week or so of sick-leave. I was not overworked, just very sad. I tried again after but it was obvious I had to stop. So, I decided I had saved enough to give myself a few months off (that week off had been good so I figured a bit more wouldn't hurt). I brought my monthly spending down to about €1300, so I could last six months.Of course I wanted to make the most out of them so I drew up an extensive plan for finding what I was always supposed to do. I made a list of all jobs I wanted to research and try. It turned out that, too,  didn't go as I thought it would. Gradually my plan would become less and less strict.It was hard in the beginning. I think we get so used to getting 'assignments' and being told exactly what to do during our school lives that it gets scary when we have nobody setting those assignments for us. But this assignment-free time allowed what really makes me happy to emerge: I found myself outside a lot of the time, and meeting up with the people I love (which became easier because we had one less calendar to worry about). And I started doing and making things when the inspiration would hit me, instead of planning it. I even started enjoying household chores, because I did them when I wanted to!Of course, this wasn't going to last forever. I'm back at a job now . It's interesting and intellectually challenging enough, and gives me a lot of autonomy.  It does not feel like my 'calling', but It's a lot easier to get out of bed now. Besides that, I (re)discovered some things to work towards, that I want to try, some projects that I started in that half year. But those are not important to go into for now. I'll try to summarize the things I learned (through reading, talking to as many people as possible, and my own experience) that I think can help:* Your path could just as well be outside the specific type of work you do. You may be the person that makes everyone laugh. You may be the person that solves problems, whatever they are. You may inspire people in a way you don't think you do.* Don't feel the need to change your passion into a job (right now). Your 'regular' job will let you keep your hobby a hobby. You won't be pressured to necessarily make something that someone wants to buy, you won't have a client to keep happy. Just practice, find friends or other people to practice with, make cool things. Who knows where that could lead!* When you know what's important to you, you can build your work around that. Maybe you need the routine of a 9-5 so you can spend more time with your partner, maybe you need flexibility because you have a lot of side projects. In my case it meant taking a pay cut and working only 4 days a week.* Even jobs you don't fully enjoy will bring you something. You need to try stuff to know what works for you and what doesn't. So don't try to force yourself to find your 'dream job' right away.* A big reason why I felt out of place at work was because I was forcing myself and my body in the office mould. And a lot more that I thought I was! When I didn't work, I'd eat a big breakfast at 11 am and dinner at 3pm. Some days I needed to sleep more than others. I could decide to not see anybody on a day with a bad case of PMS. I would go outside for a walk or swim whenever I felt restless or stuck. There probably is no job that gives you the freedom for all of this, but maybe there's some wiggle room. The first step is figuring out your own rythms and natural routines.There's some smaller stuff but I think this post has gotten long enough! Hope this can help someone, and if not it has been good to sort my thoughts:p.TL DR: After a not-everything-that-shines-is-gold-situation in my previous job I took half a year off work, learned some things, and wanted to share.;Thank you for sharing! I'm thankful for the encouragement as I have found myself in a similar position and have been considering different options how to bring change in my work life and career.#This is a really encouraging post. I’ve been looking to get out of my office job for a while and couldn’t quite put my finger on why it bothered me so much. This is great advice, and I think I might do this!

I have been working as an ETL developer with Informatica as a ETL tool, Unix and databases like Oracle, SQL Server and Teradata since several years. Recently my client has started moving to Azure, and they are using tools like Data Bricks and Pyspark. I wanted to know the path from an ETL Developer to a Data Engineer. I have started learning Python, but most of the things like Class do not seem to be related to data loading and ETL. I think Spark and Pyspark would help, but that will need working knowledge of Python. Any advice would be appreciated.;A good stepping stone is airflow. It will force you to at least sort of learn python but is a bit closer to what you are currently doing than jumping straight into spark.Edit that said if your employer is using databricks then you may need to bite the spark bullet sooner anyway#Spark uses Sparksql. Hive uses SQL. Presto uses SQL. SQL is all around you. More than python, first learn the fundamentals of the Hadoop stack, the core concepts etc. Spark is like a next gen version of it. But if you don't understand map/reduce, or the core concepts of cluster computing and how the workload gets distributed and collected back, you will really not get spark, even if you learn python and basic syntax.#Spark has two main components  the API layer and the execution engine. The API's are functionally equivalent (with a few of exceptions) across Python, Scala, and SQL - so if you know SQL already you needn't learn a new language to get started.The execution engine is quite complicated but not impenetrable, the concepts do not require a software engineering degree (although a lot of practitioners do have one) and can be self-taught. The engine is really important to understand as a Data Engineer because it is the underlying model upon which all Spark jobs (python, scala, sql, streaming, graph analytics, machine learning) are built.If you are an Azure Databricks customer I recommend that you ask for some guidance from either your Microsoft or Databricks Representative, they have lots of training available :)# **Databricks Certified Associate Developer and a Cloud Certification.**#Great advice, thanks.

Schools have created grad programs that do cover what you need to know for these fields but the preferred degrees are the former. With the certificate you will most definitely be qualified for entry level big data/data analysis positions. But again, the pay sucks.

They would still help with the ""standard"" web / mobile software development, of course.In terms of compensation for the latter track, it's going to vary widely. You could be a junior front-end dev making $50k (using U.S. estimates because that's what I'm familiar with), or you could jump into a more challenging hardware/software development role making $100,000+.Bottom line, either track could very well be a good one to do, both in terms of fun, impactful work, and compensation. I think the question you need to ask yourself is, do you want to primarily work with data, or would you prefer to do more traditional programming?#I would prefer the one that has the highest pay and/or job safety in the future.Software development sounds more likely to be interesting though.#Would the following specialisation be a standard web/mobile software development career? And what do you think about that kind of career? **Technical Interaction Design**Mobile App Development (7,5 ECTS)Applied Information Security (7,5 ECTS)Technical Interaction Design (7,5 ECTS)I'm considering going for the data science career because it sounds like there's a higher pay and its more sought after.#I think of the three tracks you have listed, this one is the most *applied* in terms of software development. If I was a recruiter though, and I read your resume and saw the ""Technical Interaction Design"" specialization along with the courses listed, I would probably try to get you into a front-end role. This is completely just my opinion, but front-end is kind of boring. Don't get me wrong, I love a crisp, clean, fully functional UI/UX, but at the end of the day it's just scratching the surface of software development and there are more challenging and rewarding paths out there. Maybe I'm reading too far into it. The Technical Interaction Design specialization wouldn't necessarily lead to a front-end role, after all it is *you* that will determine what kind of role you apply for. Personally, if I was going to go for software development as a career (like standard web/mobile), I would still go with the Software Development Specialization. My reasoning is this:You can always learn outside of classes. In fact, you should be learning outside of classes, and work for that matter. And it is a lot easier to learn, say, mobile app development in a personal rather than academic setting than it is to learn the topics listed under the Software Development Specialization. I think both tracks would be great for software dev, but you would benefit more being in an academic setting when learning the Software Development Specialization topics. Those topics really require an in-depth understanding, and having professors / instructors on hand to answer all of your questions and walk you through problems can be a huge help. I think I would only pick the Technical Interaction Specialization if I was looking to get into cyber security.As for what I think of being a web/mobile software engineer as a career? I honestly think it's fantastic. I'm in a full-stack web development role right now, and I can say it's pretty easy to find a job that pays well enough in that role. And there isn't really much of a salary cap either. I would describe software development, among other CS related fields, to have a low barrier for entry and a high potential for reward. It's all about how talented and driven you are. The work itself is fun too. Working across the whole stack means you have a lot of things to learn and improve while simultaneously generating impact for your employer (which looks good on you for your future). You said you are considering going for data science because it sounds like there's higher pay. While pay is definitely something to keep in mind, I would argue that there isn't too much of a difference between what you can make in data science and software engineering. I'm sure it varies by company too, but you can get very high paying jobs in either role. You have to think about something though: This is your entire career. This is the work you are going to be doing for potentially the rest of your adult life. I'm saying the money is good either way, so you really should think deeply about which you think you would enjoy more on a day-to-day basis. If you don't have much exposure to either topic, definitely watch some YouTube videos and read some articles comparing the two as career paths.My life is honestly driven by the pursuit of wealth and knowledge. It seems like you may be the same way. But even then, you need to make sure you enjoy your work outside of just knowing how much you are getting paid. I hope you understand what I'm trying to get across here, because it's important."

The current table looks like:    BOT_TOKEN (Primary KEY) | UNIQUE_ID | BOT_SETTINGSI need UNIQUE\_ID because each bot communicate with server via webhook with API Gateway URL like ""[aws.com/](https://aws.com/)<UNIQUE\_ID>"". I use UNIQUE\_ID because I don't want to show the secret token outside.When a new bot is registering I check if this token already in use by search by BOT\_TOKEN in the table.And when I get a request to webhook I want to get the required BOT\_TOKEN for this UNIQUE\_ID. But UNIQUE\_ID is not primary key, so I can't find this item by this attribute.I know, I can use ""Scan"" but it will be slow for big data. I tried to make a secondary index, but I can't do it without Range key which I don't need. What is the right way to solve it, when I need to have two keys in the same table by whom I can get the required item fast? Make two tables and duplicate data? :)";You do not need a range key for a global secondary index. A GSI with a primary key of UNIQUE_ID is the right way to get the query you desire. You should note that there is no unique constraint for primary keys of GSIs though, so you’ll have to enforce that in your application code.#>I tried to make a secondary index, but I can't do it without Range key Are you sure? I have tables with secondary indexes and I don't even know what a range key is. Like [this](https://will-o.co/ZARYVH0BL.png).That said, it kind of sounds like you could design this differently so you don't need it. I'm not sure I completely understand what you're describing, but can't you make the primary key the UNIQUE\_ID and then have requests that use the BOT\_TOKEN send both the UNIQUE\_ID and the secret token?#I believe the range/sort key on gsi’s is optional#no, I know only bot token or unique id, not a both together.

What steps could I take towards career in this field?;Start looking at job listings, and get a good feel for what they're asking for.  If there are skills listed that you don't have, you know things that you can work on.  Aside from that, start customizing your resume to emphasize skills that are relevant to data analyst roles and start applying for jobs.  The skills you've listed are a good start -- also make sure that you've got strong Excel skills, and maybe familiarize yourself with tools like PowerBI and Tableau as well (if there's an alternative listed more frequently on the job posts in your area, obviously go with that instead.)#Thank you for the tips, Tyrnis. Most reqruiters seem to require a few years experience even for junior positions. What would be a suitable way for gaining that experience? Honestly, I am currently not in a favorable position for practicing for months without compensation and am looking for career possibilities in this field.As for the skills development, what courses could I attend for masterinfg MS Excel on a more advanced level? PowerBI and Tableau seem to be pretty common extra skill to have in the field. I am definitely interesting in learning more about these systems, too.#Job listings are employer dream sheets.  Most entry level help desk jobs ask for experience as well, and they'll still hire people without it.  Obviously, if they're asking for 10 years of experience, they're not going to hire you, but if they're asking for less than five years (and especially for 1-3 years), they're likely to consider an entry level candidate: if they aren't, the worst that'll happen is that you won't hear back from them.As far as the skills development goes, I'd start off with Microsoft Learn.  They've got free courses that you can go through on PowerBI and probably on Excel as well.  Tableau you'd have to do some hunting -- I know you can get a trial version of the software, but I'm not sure about specific courses unless you're willing to pay for training.#Thank you for an encouraging advice. This is correct that sometimes the one can have luck even without having the required experience. It worked for me as well when I got my first sevice desk job. Later, after familiarizing with the basics of the concept of big data, I applied for a few positions in this field and had a few suggestions to apply for junior BI positions. Unfortunately, lack of experience in using the tools such as SQL led to failure of technical skill tests and the companies never considered my applications again. I do understand that the skills are to be developed and practiced and at the same time am afraid of time passing by and losing possibilities. Stress of job searching somewhat distracts from focusing on learning as you want to be actual for work asap, too.#How about BI Analyst course via Udemy, for instance? Would it be enough to cover the basics?

cscareerquestions;hot8bd;1594402374.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hot8bd/i_was_offered_a_stipend_to_take_any_certification/;I was offered a stipend to take any certification / class / program I want... but I have to choose only one.;**Quick background:**I am **not** a programmer. I've had 5+ years of experience in technical support, 2 years in product management, 1 year in quality assurance. Social anxiety struck me hard when I did product which prompted me to consider a career shift late into my 30's.I've done programming when I was in college but for whatever reason, I kept avoiding it as a career. I let fear get to me. I toyed around with Visual Basic .NET and C# in college, HTML / CSS / JS in the past year, and Python in the past few months. I am **not** an expert by any means. I can read code, but I can't save the planet if I wanted to (ok, I can save a small town, but not a planet).**Today:**I'm unemployed due to COVID-19. I've been blessed with a gift of choosing a program of my choosing (money is nearly no object) through the State of Texas because I am disabled. Their goal is to get me employed as quickly as possible. I saw positions that I really like that I feel I could achieve in a quick amount of time:\- A / B Web Test Engineer (HTML, CSS, JS to manipulate the DOM, scripting, reporting)  \- Data Reporting Analyst / Developer (leverages SQL, big data, R, Python for automation / scripting)I eventually want to go full onto a software development role -- front end, back end, it almost doesn't matter to me.**Options:**1. Use the stipend for only a coding boot camp.2. Specialize in a programming language on my own and use the stipend on something technical (for example, AWS cloud services or DevOps)3. Specialize in a programming language on my own and use the stipent on something management-related (for example, Certified Product Owner or Project Management)4. Use the stipend for something pretty amazing that I'm not aware of.**My conflicts:**I'm good at a lot of things but I'm not an expert in any. I think I need to be focused on one skill or a skill set. Something tells me I should focus on boot camp entirely. At least I will feel obligated to doing the course work.I have had people tell me that doing coding boot camp tells employers that I can't do the work on my own. That I would appear as if I lack self-initiative. Some say I would be devaluing my skills or candidacy (is that even true?). But I've seen people get fast tracked to interviews just because they've done boot camps from a reputable organization such as an accredited university. I do know a portfolio speaks louder than a piece of certification. But I also want to make sure I make the most effective use of that stipend.What would you do? Thank you for any thoughtful responses.;I vote 1 or 2. The bootcamps are useful for getting you up and running with a coherent stack and help with locating employers that use that stack.Aws/DevOps is hot right now and the qualification is helpful.Either would give you a decent leg up and be relatively fun. The mgmt style courses are much less clear in outcome and I don't think such a good fit here.#Bootcamp

I will be enrolled in courses such as Network Science, ML, Data Mining, Stat Analysis, and cloud computation during a 2 year span.I graduated in Dec with a degree in business analytics and Info systems. I currently have a job with a big data measurement company but i work in account management, not really doing anything that I thought i would be doing, also for shit pay. I love learning new things & feel like I get genuinely excited to work with data that I find interesting. However, I’m starting to have cold feet about getting my masters because I dont know if it is worth my time, the cost, and I’m scared I may not be smart enough. Also afraid of hating my profession in the future because I want to feel like I’m making an impact on the world. What do you guys think? Are masters worth it in todays climate? Should I commit to getting my masters or should I get more experience first, then go and complete my masters?;If cost is your biggest deterrent I would start looking for a new job personally, a lot of companies with good benefit packages will do some sort of tuition reimbursement if you choose a master’s degree that you can justify will benefit the company and is related to your position.  Plus, I’m not sure how your learning style is but I absolutely hate taking online courses which I’m assuming is the format most of yours would be due to Covid.  Could you maybe defer for a year and start looking for a different employer in the meantime? Congrats on getting into a program though and best of luck!#Yeah that was my original plan with tuition reimbursement but since I’m not full time at my current job, I’m unable to receive the benefit. I’ve been trying to go full time for the past few months but with covid & the change in the companies structure, it is looking unlikely. But for online classes it is alright, I just would not leave the apartment ever because of class & work all online. Maybe I should wait, this decision has been killing me.#Ahh gotcha, I just finished a 2 year stint as a contract employee and finally got hired as a full time employee at a different company so I know how that is. It sounds cheesy but maybe making a pros and cons list might help you decide?  If you have that many doubts than maybe it is best to wait though  I have quite a few friends who regret going to grad school but also some who absolutely love it and got great jobs when they finished. Either way, best of luck to you!

After thinking about it for a while, I decided I want to get into data science. At the moment I'm doing my bachelor in Mathematics. Anyway, my university offers this master which goes by the name of ""mathematics for data science"". I want you to tell me what you think about the program. Here's the courses list with brief description in case it's not clear what the course is about. Sorry if the description is not super clear by I haven't studied the subjects so I don't know neither 😅 -Stochastic processes: gaussian processes, stationary processes and markov processes, martingale -Linear models: statistics, in particular generalized linear models and likelihood functions -advanced statistical methods: analysis of asymptotic estimators. Lot of R. -bayesian statistics: the foundation of the theory itself and its laboratorial part using R (Monte Carlo methods, gibson samples, Hastings metropolis...). -Time series: ARMA models ecc.... R again. -Scientific computing: basically an advanced numerical analysis course with a lot emphasis on linear algebra and pde using MATLAB -Mathematical biology: ok this should be a course in which you study mathematical models of natural phenomena (such as epidemiology ecc...). Lots of pde's and matlab, again. -Topological data analysis: ok this is interesting. It should be something like applied algebraic topology (computational topology maybe?). -Tensor decomposition for big data analysis: ok really don't know what's going on here. Guess it's about advanced topics in linear algebra. The course description says there's also some software involved. -Data analysis and exploration: R again. This course is focuses on machine learning algorithms applied mainly in biological domain. It's also about data visualization ecc... -Scientific programming: algorithms(trees, graphs, ecc..)in Python. Basically an excuse to study Python properly. -Data mining: clustering ecc... -Machine learning -Deep leaningI'm also thinking about doing an internship if I have the possibility.As you see there's still a lot of math involved, as it's technically a master in mathematics. For me this is actually a good thing, since I don't want to waste my mathematical background. Do you think it can be good?";sounds nice. I've followed Data Science and Scientific Computing in Trieste University, and it was good, for me.#Cool,Did you get a job in data after completing your master? Have your courses been somehow useful? There is something you wished you had studied better in the master program?#Yes, yes, and.. really no. I come from a biotech background, and the math part was REALLY hard. But I feel the program was complete, and gave you the correct tools, from software development to core math and stats.

I took a cloud computing bootcamp right out of high school where i learned skills such as Python, Security,Networking, Linux and AWS. I was able to get my cloud practitioner. I later enrolled in a Cloud computing pathway at my college and next semester i’m graduating with an Associates in cloud computing. After the bootcamp program, i was also able to land an internship at an AWS Advanced consulting partner where i worked and was able to achieve the AWS Dev, Solutions Architect Associates and the Big Data. I’ve been working long hours at the internship but it seems to be based on Project pay and isn’t very consistent. I’ve tried to look for other jobs but it seems like everything requires many years of experience. Any advice? Thanks.;Cloud engineering positions should never be entry level in my opinion. You should have a good foundational knowledge before making production changes in someone's cloud environment.#I think you could find a role with those certs and the internship, but you may also find success gaining some more Windows experience and maybe Sec+ and hopping into a role for a heavy on-premise business that is looking to migrate to the cloud. I have seen lots of job postings that are seemingly un-cloud related, but they add in cloud experience as a plus and that there are quite a few people who don't know what to do with public cloud, don't understand how to budget for it, and cannot get away from the idea of provisioning VMs on VMware and adding hardware every year to their DC. You may be able to make a big impact with the right leadership.
golang;hx17wm;1595595087.0;/r/golang/comments/hx17wm/advice_rewrite_partly_finished_project_in_go/;[Advice] Rewrite partly finished project in go?;"Hi there community,this is my first post in /r/golang and I am quite new to go. I hope that some of you guys might be able to help me out a little with a decision. So this is kind of a combined question and I am also looking to get some insights into professional software programming strategies and design decisions. I have written a darts scoreboard application a time ago using python with flask and jinja2 templates as a viewing engine. That project is quite old and I decided to rewrite it using modern technology. Therefore I learned react and decided to use a combination of a RESTful API design and graphql for transfering big data junks to my frontend fpr easier parsing.As the backend also needs to integrate the game logic the software is quite big afterwards and not that easy to handle an maintaine.I do love the fact, that go is easy to learn (I did a few programs in go already) and that it is simple and straight forward. Also it is compilable which means I could release single file applications at the long run.So do you guys think it might be worth it to start over using go as a backend language (which works quite well with react) and build out my API there?I did not do that much yet, so there will be not much time lost by restarting once again.Also I would like your opinion on design. To get you a little more detail information I want to point out what the software will do.One is able to configure and start a game of darts (add player with profile and picture, choose game type and player playing, start the game).One Index page will then be redirected to a scoreboard page and one admin page will be redirected to a controller page. The scoreboard page shows the game stats to the players playing darts and the controller page is there to add throws in. (If you do not use a recognition software which will send the api requests automatically).So the backend needs to fetch the throws (/throw/20/1 - is single 20, /throw/20/2 is double twenty ..) and then run some logic.If you know a game of darts there is quite a lot to handle. Winning conditions, Bust, etc... And I want to store the game state in a database (sqlite or something like that).How would you guys approach this? Cause right now I have a hybrid API running which will add throws but also handle gameplay.There are other difficulties like undoing falsly booked throws or changing to the next player and so on.So I am quite unsure if I do that in a well design and if this will even be possible or advisable to do in go.I will leave my ""old"" scoreboard code ([https://github.com/patrickhener/dart-o-mat-3000](https://github.com/patrickhener/dart-o-mat-3000), [https://dart-o-mat-3000.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://dart-o-mat-3000.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) here. The new one is intended to work like the old one does if my design concept is good. Otherwise I am grateful and thankful for every guidance I can receive from you guys.If someone wants to elaborate more on how to do it right I can also add you to the github repo for the new software approach. Just shoot me a dm.Thanks in advance,  best regards,  Patrick";too sleepy to the answer the second part, as for the first half,since it's not a work project, I advice to go with whatever you want to learn more, I think there's a lot to learn in both rewriting it, and refactoring the flask app into just an API.imo, if you're still interested in working with python later on, and you have the time, I'd first refactor the python app into an API, and the rewrite it in Go#Thanks for that input buddy. I am curious what your answers would be for the second Part. So maybe you might wanna elaborate a bit more after getting some sleep? Thanks again.

If indifferent, put N/A.**  N/A* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  A bit of gaming when I get time.

At what settings and FPS do you want?**  I listed the games above but I'd like to hit 60fps as a minimum on medium settings preferably (tired of playing on low settings haha)* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  Fingerprint reader or Windows Hello for convenience. Storage isn't too important, I mostly use an external HDD and SSD* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  I am a Computer Science major (starting this August) and I'll be remotely accessing my university's computer lab to access programs. I may also switch to Business information systems which will cover things such as big data, cybersecurity, coding, so I'd like something that could handle all of that.   * Cheers!;"Since you are at uni you should have something lightweight and small but since you are also a CS major who will be coding you will need as much vertical screen and screen size as possible so I'd suggest the XPS 15 9500, it is literally the smallest 15"" laptop you can find and it has a 16:10 screen size which is amazing for productivity. Since it is an XPS the build quality will be second to none and the battery life on this year's model is pretty amazing too. The screen is beautiful and the keyboard and trackpad are elite.I'd suggest [this](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/xps-15-9500-laptop/xn9500cto210s) version, its 1499$ and has an Nvidia GTX 1650 ti so it'll be more than enough for your gaming needs. The downside to this version is only 8gb of ram but it's upgradable (so is the SSD) so you can easily do that in the future or you can make it 16gb for 100$ extra but I'd suggest you do it on your own to save money and get better faster memory. This is very future proof in this way.I know this isn't the best bang for the buck performance wise but if you want something really portable with the best build quality and longevity this is perfect and can last you for 4+ years.The early releases of this laptop had trackpad issues but all the new ones don't so if you buy it directly from dell it shouldn't be an issue but if you buy from somewhere else just make sure the trackpad isn't wobbly and return it if it is.Edit: You can go for the i5 4C version too but it doesn't have the graphics and the battery is bit smaller and obviously an i5 wont last as long as an i7 6C.#Yeah I considered the XPS alongside the Razer Blade Stealth, problem is they're both a lot more expensive here in the Philippines. The Dell XPS that you linked would cost me close to 2,000 USD here instead of 1,500 USD."

Thank you!;I was always planning on going to graduate school after college, but decided to do self taught instead., and it was well worth it.  Big data is such a broad topic it is hard to find direction.  To keep it short and simple i'll break it up into two directions.  First Data Analytics.  This is pretty much simply gaining insights from data.  Being able to do this in excel would probably get you entry level at some client facing fintech company, which  narrows your options to something that benefits the company.  From there you can start studying statistics and learn models commonly applied to finance.  Here are the skills from beginner to advanced, Excel, T-SQL (transact SQL), Tableau, R, Python, Machine Learning.  Learning statistics is important because most ML models are backed by statistics.  &#x200B Second is Data Engineering.  This is just what I call it, and is more related to making the data available.  You are responsible for receiving data from a source, and formatting it so Data Analysts can use it in their models & visualizations.  This is far more focused on programming and uses almost no data visualization.  The skills that benefit Data Engineering are, Excel, SQL (Database Architecture), SSIS, Python, Hadoop.  &#x200B You sound like you are more leaning toward analytics.  First check out job postings and look at the skills required for the more interesting ones, develop some of the easier skills.  My existing excel knowledge and willingness to learn got me an analytics job in marketing, over 2 years there I  learned SQL & tableau at work and python on my own time.  SQL & tableau took me probably 250 hrs each to be proficient, python took probably 750 hrs.  At that time I was qualified for a developer position, but it took me another 1000 hrs to convince myself of that.#Thank you so much for that thoughtful comment! Lots of helpful info in there I will refer back to. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain that and offer some great tips!

I am looking for information where all steps described in details;No, there are far too many variables for anything like this to exist.  In fact, I don’t really see how anything in the real world can be built “from scratch” as there has to be an existing system (even if it is being replaced). Usually you would pick an ecosystem or platform and pick the components that are important to you.  Cloud is easiest, but on-prem solutions are plentiful.#Maybe you know an example of implementing a platform? I am looking for a case when 1) a company did not have any big data analysis, 2) then it started to implement any big data tool (databases, collection and storing of data etc.), 3) then it got more successful due to big data analysis. I am looking for narrowing of these 3 steps in small details. In oil&gas industry or in metallurgy

From sales to inventory, employee punch-in timings to productivity, and many other parameters, the types of data are diverse. And if analyzed properly, these could reveal some extremely useful insights that would guide an organization in taking the right strategic decisions.This burgeoning need to analyze data is the reason behind the rising demand for data science professionals.

What are my chances of getting admitted to an MS in CS with a low GPA and transitioning major? And what are my best options?;Warning: wall of text incomingI'm from Taiwan. I'm graduating in 2021 from National Taipei University of Technology.I major in Mechanical Engineering and I want to do MS in CS in the US or Canada.My GPA is very low at 2.52 due to a combination of factors:* **Tough grading in my department** \- NTUT is notorious for harsh grades, even more so in my department. For reference, I rank in 116/153 or 75.81% in my department. I know that is in no way impressive but given my GPA I hope you see where I'm coming from regarding the tough grading.* **My lack of prior knowledge in ME** \- NTUT is a Technical University where most of the students come from Technical Highschool and major in their respective fields. I, however, graduated from a general high school with no particular focus.* **My lack of interest in ME** \- After the first year it became clear to me that ME does not interest me and is not what I thought it was. My academic goal became just to graduate and get an MS in CS.* **Me focusing on CS later on** \- After I decided to go for CS in graduate school I started to focus on CS related courses, which I performed pretty well, taking online courses, doing projects, etc.On the other hand, here are some things that might help:* **Experience in a University in the US** \- I was very fortunate to go to the University of Cincinnati two times, one time in summer (5 weeks) to take a course in Industrial Big Data, and later as an exchange student for one semester (spring 2020) to take CS courses.* **Scholarships** (?) - NTUT sponsored both times to the US covering all tuition fees, airfare and partially supporting living costs. I'm not sure if this should be called a scholarship or something else?* **Good performance in CS related courses** \- While in Cincinnati I have a CGPA of 3.91, and I got an A (4.0) in Data Structures. In NTUT I got A in pretty much any course that required programming.* **Projects** \- In Cincinnati a did a senior project about Diabetic Retinopathy Detection with deep learning. My undergraduate thesis in NTUT is about using EEG (brain waves) signals and machine learning algorithms to enable people who can't move their bodies due to some kind of diseases to control and read e-books.* **Extracurricular Activities** \- Being the president of a club in NTUT and participated in other activities throughout high school and university. I'm gonna take the GRE and IELTS pretty soon and I expect around 8.0 for IELTS. I don't expect my  GRE to be impressive so it's probably gonna be ok to good-ish.Now my questions are: What are my chances for a decent MS in CS? Which universities are likely to give me a chance? What should I emphasize in my statement?Particularly, I'm having a really hard time evaluating my chances and coming up with a list of schools to apply, since I have next to no idea how they would view my somewhat uncommon profile.I'd love to provide more details if needed.Thanks a lot for any advice!;Upppp

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**The main reason I want to build this PC is because for Uni work we are currently using convolutional neural networks to analyse sets of images on Jupyter Notebook.

I understand that the PC probably will not be completed by the time this subject is done but I still have big data subjects to come which it will be helpful for.

If it helps in making suggestions these are the few books in that genre I've read which have had a real impact on me: - The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People- The Life Changing Magic of Tinying Up- The Millionaire Next Door- The Gift of Fear- Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are- The Hidden Life of Trees- The Secret Wisdom of Nature;Daring Greatly, The Happiness Equation, The Power of Now, Atomic Habits are some books which I think were really good#You might find Deep Work by Cal Newport useful.I also recommend de Bono’s books on thinking. A short read of his is Six Thinking Hats.
laptops;hxqsi8;1595698995.0;/r/laptops/comments/hxqsi8/suggestions_on_buying_2nd_laptop/;Suggestions on buying 2nd laptop;Hi guys, Getting off my current 10 yr old MacBook Pro and want some suggestions on a new laptop. I work in finance specifically accounting controls for equity desks (might transition soon however) so I work with large data sets on a daily basis. Do have an interest in learning programming languages soon (have minimal experience in c/c++) and would like a laptop that has sufficient functionality for most programming languages especially if I get more serious about it. Think I want at least 8gb RAM but open to other opinions on that. I would also prefer thunderbolt port but also kinda want an HDMI port so I can work off a tv and want to plug in keyboard too. Not into gaming or much graphic editing/design. Also want something lightweight/good battery and preferably want something with windows built in, kinda done with Apple for laptops. If it means anything eventually want to start my own business so maybe that plays a role in laptop selection as well. Laptop priorities are basically functionality for learning programming, handling big data sets, and general reliability. Budget is preferably $1200 on the high end but can change if there is a perfect fit out of that range. Thanks for the help!;I’ve also been very interested in certain crypto currencies so would like to download public ledgers and take deep dives into the blockchain.

The service will use keywords and bring in a list of any site that has that keyword. Example - new plastic toothbrush.  Rather than having to individually connect to API's of 1m blogs, or scrape them, are there any big data sources that already do this? Or where I can tap into a single few sources, rather than have to scrape 1m blogs/forums?;You've pretty much described Google haven't you?That's basically what a web crawling search engine does#For social media platforms, i think you should try [buzzsumo](https://buzzsumo.com/). They have almost any data source media that you can think of. (Require extra cost)  For forums and blogs, better stick to their public API and you should only think about big website: such as reddit for easy scrape.

A bit about me:I'm currently 22 years old. In terms of my kinks, I'm interested in chastity, orgasm denial, teasing, edging, strapon-anal (receiving), bondage, cunnilingus being the main ones with some others along the side. My limits include findom, scat, blood.Within an FLR relationship, I think the ideal theme is to allow the girlfriend/wife feel COMFORTABLE and of course empowered. The last thing I would want is to make my domme feel pressured to maintain a dominant composure without enjoying it. As a couple, during the early stages we can learn about each other's limits, expectations and adjust accordingly to have a consensual exchange of power that allows you to feel like a princess/queen, while I learn more about the main, and even smaller things I can do in our relationship to satisfy your desires and meet the expectations that you have bestowed upon me.An idea of me outside of the kink/femdom domain:For work I'm a technical consultant, specialising within the Azure cloud space. I work for a company that is a Microsoft Partner I'm loving my job after understanding the expansive capabilities that can be offered by cloud solutions :D In the future I aspire to fulfill the role of a principal consultant within the cloud space, or other domains that have massive technological influence (namely big data, AI and Machine Learning).I would consider myself fairly ambitious, sporty and outgoing.

I work for a company that is a Microsoft Partner I'm loving my job after understanding the expansive capabilities that can be offered by cloud solutions :D In the future I aspire to fulfill the role of a principal consultant within the cloud space, or other domains that have massive technological influence (namely big data, AI and Machine Learning).I would consider myself fairly ambitious, sporty and outgoing. In terms of sports and exercise, my favourite at the moment is long distance running (Ran the Blackmore marathon :), swimming and weights. Completing a 100km super marathon and an Ironman Triathlon are two major fitness related bucket list goals that I'm working hard on achieving right now. Outside of sports, I like to read, listen to music (primarily Asian music, chillstep etc.). When hanging out with friends I like eating out, going to karaoke, picnics, hiking and so forth.I'm not the kind of person who indulges in alcohol drinking much at all, primarily for health reasons and also to the fact that I can't handle my alcohol for shit, so hope that's not an issue to you :pIn terms of what I'm looking for in a domme:I'm expecting a slow, gentle and easy start into the femdom aspect within the relationship. This will give us time to really understand each other on a deeper level. It will also allow me time to adjust into the sub that fits with your expectations.Therefore, I'm totally ok with a domme/mistress figure who's inexperienced or simply just curious to test things out. I'd much prefer that than a full on hardcore domination experience right from the start.Honesty is also highly valued. If there are certain things within the femdom scene that you find uncomfortable, or want to try out, I expect you to speak up, and you should expect me to listen so we can have a proper discussion together on the expectations and limits.The femdom aspects also needn't only exist within the sex scene. The idea is to make you feel comfortable as the leader within the relationship!In terms of age preference, 18-30 would be ideal. I'd prefer to be with someone of similar age as me. It would also be good if you have similar interests as me so we have other things to talk and do together outside of purely the femdom aspect alone. Being Asian would also be a plus :)If this is something that interests you, or you simply want to discuss together in a bit more detail before considering it (those new to femdom, or don't know what it is exactly), feel free to message me so we can discuss it in more detail :DPS. I'd be willing to exchange pictures of Snapchat during the early stages of communication before connecting through other social medium platforms.;

The whole Cambridge Analytica fiasco blew the lid on the more secretive industry of behavioural analytics and how big companies collect our data (and what they do with it).While there are positives (easier to connect with others, ability to share information widely which allows for more informed people, voters, supporters, etc.) there's also many negatives (spread of misinformation, manipulation of weaknesses like cybersecurity and hostile rhetoric, etc.) How has it affected democracy? Might get in trouble for this opinion, but it's really shown how weak voters' minds are when combatting disinformation and manipulation. I'm in Canada and volunteered in the 2019 election, so I met a lot of voters on the campaign trail. While Canadian's are usually level headed, I met some people who were SUPER misinformed, but voting citizens nonetheless (or misinformed and refusing to vote, which I'm not sure is worse or better since they were very close-minded)."

These aren't really ""big data"" numbers, but I figure you guys will have some good adviceComputers: \- MacBook Pro (512gb local storage) \- Windows 10 gaming desktop (512gb SSD + 1TB + 2TB + 2TB drives)Stuff I want to store more securely: \- A Time Machine backup of my MacBook Pro\- Raw files (\~400gb stored separately from Lightroom catalogs) - currently all on a 1TB external drive\- All other files (\~ 150gb all currently stored locally on MacBook as well as in iCloud Drive)\- Media Library for Plex streaming  (\~1.1TB currently on one of the 2TB drives on the gaming desktop)That's about it. I was playing around and managed to setup an SMB share on the gaming desktop that allowed me to run Time Machine backups over the network, backing up onto a spare disk image. This works shockingly well. I would also like to move away from having all my photography raw files stored on an external drive. I'd like to move this onto one of the drives on the gaming desktop as well for more archival storage purposes (ie. I won't be working directly off it). My main concern is that there is no real redundancy here outside of my ""other files"" category. Those files at least exist in iCloud, locally on my MacBook, and also on Time Machine backups. But raw files only exist in one location. Ditto my media library.I decided I'd try to set up storage spaces on my gaming desktop to build a bit more redundancy into the system, but apparently that's basically broken in Windows 10 2004. So, I'm kind of stuck right now on that.I'd also like to backup to an online service at some point, but want to be as cost effective as possible, given that I'm pretty unlikely to access it with any real frequency (like one ""oh crap literally everything broke"" event every 5+ years at most).

I travelled and worked on personal projects until Summer 2019 and Started as a Masters Student in Computer Science in a Top Tier University in Canada in Fall 2019. TBH this is a coursework degree. It's purely to compensate for the shitty education I got in my undergrad (I did my best and got terrific grades, but the University was mediocre). I struggled in the first term in my Grad School but improved and did well in the next two terms (Currently third summer term). I have a fantastic Supervisor, and I am learning a lot from him, and my final report is on Software Engineering for Big Data Applications and I have done well in all the courses I have taken. I have learnt a lot working my ass off since I came to Canada, and I have Improved a lot.I have no previous work or Internship experience in Canada or India, and I would like you to answer the following questions.1. What are the chances that I will even get an Interview with FAANG Companies for New Grad roles, and Do they hire New Grads without Internship experience? Should I forget about FAANG (Mostly Amazon or any FAANG that has Offices in Canada)?2. Should I stop leet coding and learn technologies (React and django) to apply for a simple new junior developer job in third-tier companies in Canada?3. What are the chances of getting a SWE Job without an Internship?4. Can I apply to Internships in these FANGS or Startups after Graduating  (Graduating in December 2020)?5. What kind of Companies and Roles should I target to land a good SWE role in Canada given my current situation?As I am yet to start Applying for Jobs, Which roles do you think I should apply for and increase my chances ?I don't know what to do as all the paths seem to be unreachable to a new person in a new country. Please only reply to this post if you know the Candian situation around SWE hiring or if you are serious about helping or giving suggestions for improvement.

cscareerquestions;hw8uje;1595476756.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hw8uje/advice_weighing_different_offers/;Advice Weighing Different Offers;I'm hoping to get some advice on which of two offers would be better for my career. I have two offers of roughly equal compensation, both companies are in the top 20 of the Fortune 500 rankings. One position is as a data analyst. I would receive requests for data, and I would use SQL and some GUI software to fulfill those requests and provide the requested data. The databases I would be working with are very large. Other than a little bit of SQL, the job wouldn't involve much actual coding, but I could probably list it on my resume as big data experience. The other position is a typical entry level software developer job and is exactly what you'd expect of that type of job.      My background: I have a four year degree in a non-CS field and about ten years of work experience also in a non-CS field. I recently decided to switch to tech, and completed a three month coding bootcamp. I love coding and everyone I've met has been impressed with my skill level given the amount of time I've been doing it.      Does anyone have any advice on which position would look the best on my resume, help me advance in my career, or help me become a better software developer?;
cscareerquestions;htzrjh;1595161887.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/htzrjh/should_i_look_for_another_job/;Should I look for another job?;After completing my undergrad in computer science, I got a job in iOS development but I got bored with it eventually. I was not getting to learn anything new and having to do same thing over and over. I was offered another job in big data and I found that exciting so I seized the opportunity. Now, I have been writing scripts to scrape data from websites for 3 months. There's no sign of big data so far. I am sure the guy who offered me the job doesn't even know what big data is. This is starting to look like dull work. I don't know if this is something I should be pursuing. I want to with hot technologies like react, node, docker, aws, django and more. I have no idea what should I do I have already changed the iOS job after 6 months and I don't if it would be good if switched again after 3 months. This has been causing a headache for weeks now. Please give some advice.;"Look for a new job and when someone asks you why you're leaving your current job, just be honest.""My current job isn't giving me the growth opportunities that I am looking for.""And then they'll ask you what those opportunities are and you give them what's important to you.I've never had an interviewer be bothered by the fact that I was fully aware of what I wanted in a job. It's usually a plus.#Great suggestion. It scares me a lot when I think that what if I end up doing this scraping job for a few more months and when I decide to change the job, I wouldn't have any other skill and there's not many jobs for web scraping rn."
cscareerquestions;hlvmln;1593988097.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hlvmln/computer_science_electives/;Computer Science Electives;I'm a 3rd year student in a BSc Computer Science course in the Caribbean and I know this question comes up every now and again, but CS is not such a focus over here so it may be quite difficult to get many jobs related to this field other than Web Development, Software Engineering or Database Management, so I've come here to ask essentially which bases would CS employers, not just in the Caribbean, but generally look for?  I'm really interested in topics like Game/Web/Mobile Programming but it would have to be reserved to hobbies or freelance work if I actually want to make a living.  That being said, I'm trying to choose those that would give me a well rounded foundation in CS. As in, which of these subjects, as CS professionals, would you think is most necessary vs which ones i don't really need to focus on.  (Sorry if my point is a bit muddled)   * Wireless and Mobile Computing * Introduction to Data Analytics* Object-Oriented Programming II* Special Topics in Computer Science * Professional Ethics and Law * Business Information Systems * Fundamentals of LAN Technologies * Intelligent Systems * Game Programming * Big Data Analytics * Modelling and Simulation * Cloud Computing * Fundamentals of WAN Technologies * E-Commerce * Database Administration for Professionals;YMMV but my thoughts:Yes - basics or hot topics.    Object-Oriented Programming II.    Introduction to Data Analytics.    Big Data Analytics   Cloud Computing  Professional Ethics and Law - no one will be thinking to check for this but you should take it anyway.  Maybe - check the syllabus  Wireless and Mobile Computing.  E-Commerce.  Special Topics in Computer Science - who knows what might be in this magic bucket :p.  Less useful career wise for a swe.  Fundamentals of LAN Technologies - more it than swe.  Business Information Systems - old and not a fun career path.  Intelligent Systems - out of date and not generally applicable ime.  Game Programming - oversubscribed.  Modelling and Simulation - generally in my experience these are out of date now, and not broad usage.  Fundamentals of WAN Technologies - more it than swe.  Database Administration for professionals - a little SQL is helpful. This sounds like DB admin which is way less fun.   Modules vary massively by university so take the above with a pinch of salt but from the outside without any other context these are my first thoughts.#Thank you for identifying that they were outdated. The syllabus hasn't changed in years so your insight is extremely helpful. I will take all your information into account

My concern is that the people on the company doesn’t really now how to work with linux, and they think Big Data is something that you grab and just start messing with it&#x200B Thanks for all the help!;Reads like a homework problem but I'll give you a few tips either way.For starters you are going to want a domain because the company may wish to rapidly expand without having to revisit this sort of nebulous start-up planning. I'm also going to assume the company wants to use Windows because that's what most of the public knows, so that typically means a Windows domain. These come with license packs for the total number of clients with one being specifically 10. Your case should include the cost of licensing Windows and assume all software is legally paid for.You want your Windows primary domain controller (PDC) to **absolutely not** be doing the external data work. It needs to be handling DC tasks like backups, user access, internal data, etc. You are going to want a Backup Domain Controller in case the PDC fails so the company doesn't have significant downtime. These need to be hooked up to an external backup appliance and you probably really want UPS for both PDC and BDC, the backup appliance(s) and any network switches or routers. You never *want* a situation where a user cannot sit down and get right to work.Then you will have your analysis machines. These can be Linux and you can work on your own software bridges. You can have one at first but again, you'll want a backup machine and a plan for scaling. You'll want to find out about rack space at a local server environment in case the server room becomes a pain in the butt to handle.You'll want to outline a data analysis scenario for the company. For example finding out the most popular movie by cities with greater than 50,000 population. You will demonstrate how this could be achieved using your setup. You'll show that linux is only a workhorse and that the final results would be available for access via XML or CSV or JSON or whatever you like on demand, and also explain that this can be imported into a database or formatted easily for web viewing, and that only developers and administrators would have to understand the linux environment.Finally you are going to be writing up your proposal in Docs and listing the equipment in Sheets. Look up some high and low prices and give a cost estimate in the spreadsheet. Reject any attempt by the company to compromise on security by pointing out the sheer liability of breeches and the obligation to protect sensitive data. If this is a real business case and not homework and they want to skimp on security walk away fast.The rest I will leave to you, but this should get your head in the right spot. Good luck on the finals.

BDSMpersonals;hzrxtx;1595987932.0;/r/BDSMpersonals/comments/hzrxtx/22m4f_athletic_asian_sub_seeking_domme_for/;22[M4F] Athletic Asian sub seeking domme for LTR/play-partner #Sydney; Hi fellow redditors,I'm a submissive Asian (more specifically Chinese) guy from Sydney Australia. I've been interested in the whole femdom area/topic for about 3-4 years now and would love to commit to a FLR, preferably in person, or otherwise an online arrangement can work also. A bit about me:I'm currently 22 years old. In terms of my kinks, I'm interested in chastity, orgasm denial, teasing, edging, strapon-anal (receiving), bondage, cunnilingus being the main ones with some others along the side. My limits include findom, scat, blood.Within an FLR relationship, I think the ideal theme is to allow the girlfriend/wife feel COMFORTABLE and of course empowered. The last thing I would want is to make my domme feel pressured to maintain a dominant composure without enjoying it. As a couple, during the early stages we can learn about each other's limits, expectations and adjust accordingly to have a consensual exchange of power that allows you to feel like a princess/queen, while I learn more about the main, and even smaller things I can do in our relationship to satisfy your desires and meet the expectations that you have bestowed upon me.An idea of me outside of the kink/femdom domain:For work I'm a technical consultant, specialising within the Azure cloud space. I work for a company that is a Microsoft Partner I'm loving my job after understanding the expansive capabilities that can be offered by cloud solutions :D In the future I aspire to fulfill the role of a principal consultant within the cloud space, or other domains that have massive technological influence (namely big data, AI and Machine Learning).I would consider myself fairly ambitious, sporty and outgoing. In terms of sports and exercise, my favourite at the moment is long distance running (Ran the Blackmore marathon :), swimming and weights. Completing a 100km super marathon and an Ironman Triathlon are two major fitness related bucket list goals that I'm working hard on achieving right now. Outside of sports, I like to read, listen to music (primarily Asian music, chillstep etc.). When hanging out with friends I like eating out, going to karaoke, picnics, hiking and so forth.I'm not the kind of person who indulges in alcohol drinking much at all, primarily for health reasons and also to the fact that I can't handle my alcohol for shit, so hope that's not an issue to you :pIn terms of what I'm looking for in a domme:I'm expecting a slow, gentle and easy start into the femdom aspect within the relationship. This will give us time to really understand each other on a deeper level. It will also allow me time to adjust into the sub that fits with your expectations.Therefore, I'm totally ok with a domme/mistress figure who's inexperienced or simply just curious to test things out. I'd much prefer that than a full on hardcore domination experience right from the start.Honesty is also highly valued. If there are certain things within the femdom scene that you find uncomfortable, or want to try out, I expect you to speak up, and you should expect me to listen so we can have a proper discussion together on the expectations and limits.The femdom aspects also needn't only exist within the sex scene. The idea is to make you feel comfortable as the leader within the relationship!In terms of age preference, 18-30 would be ideal. I'd prefer to be with someone of similar age as me. It would also be good if you have similar interests as me so we have other things to talk and do together outside of purely the femdom aspect alone. Being Asian would also be a plus :)If this is something that interests you, or you simply want to discuss together in a bit more detail before considering it (those new to femdom, or don't know what it is exactly), feel free to message me so we can discuss it in more detail :DPS. I'd be willing to exchange pictures of Snapchat during the early stages of communication before connecting through other social medium platforms.;

AskEconomics;hpj19f;1594506119.0;/r/AskEconomics/comments/hpj19f/econ_majorbusiness_analytics_minor/;Econ Major/Business Analytics Minor?;Hello! I'm doing a B.S. in International Affairs and Economics at a well-regarded, but not elite, private school in DC. Lately I've gotten more interested in the business/financial side of things, and found that there's a minor in Business Analytics where I'd do statistical programming, decision models, data mining and SQL. Would be interested in working with big data, and I've done two Java programming courses for my Econ major, as well as Econometrics, Game Theory, Intermediate Micro/Macro, Calc 1/2 etc.Do you think getting the Business Analytics minor with an Econ background could get me a job in the field? Or could I parlay that into a financial role (insurance, credit analyst, budget analyst etc)? Are there any other jobs that you could suggest with this skill set?(I know I should be interning, and I'm trying. My internships so far have been in political think tanks and the like, and hopefully this year I'll branch out more).Thanks!;
r4rSydneyXXX;hnymaj;1594278566.0;/r/r4rSydneyXXX/comments/hnymaj/22m4f_athletic_asian_sub_seeking_domme_for/;22[M4F] Athletic Asian sub seeking domme for LTR/play-partner; Hi fellow redditors,I'm a submissive Asian (more specifically Chinese) guy from Sydney Australia. I've been interested in the whole femdom area/topic for about 3-4 years now and would love to commit to a FLR, preferably in person, or otherwise an online arrangement can work also. A bit about me:I'm currently 22 years old. In terms of my kinks, I'm interested in chastity, orgasm denial, teasing, edging, strapon-anal (receiving), bondage, cunnilingus being the main ones with some others along the side. My limits include findom, scat, blood.Within an FLR relationship, I think the ideal theme is to allow the girlfriend/wife feel COMFORTABLE and of course empowered. The last thing I would want is to make my domme feel pressured to maintain a dominant composure without enjoying it. As a couple, during the early stages we can learn about each other's limits, expectations and adjust accordingly to have a consensual exchange of power that allows you to feel like a princess/queen, while I learn more about the main, and even smaller things I can do in our relationship to satisfy your desires and meet the expectations that you have bestowed upon me.An idea of me outside of the kink/femdom domain:For work I'm a technical consultant, specialising within the Azure cloud space. I work for a company that is a Microsoft Partner I'm loving my job after understanding the expansive capabilities that can be offered by cloud solutions :D In the future I aspire to fulfill the role of a principal consultant within the cloud space, or other domains that have massive technological influence (namely big data, AI and Machine Learning).I would consider myself fairly ambitious, sporty and outgoing. In terms of sports and exercise, my favourite at the moment is long distance running (Ran the Blackmore marathon :), swimming and weights. Completing a 100km super marathon and an Ironman Triathlon are two major fitness related bucket list goals that I'm working hard on achieving right now. Outside of sports, I like to read, listen to music (primarily Asian music, chillstep etc.). When hanging out with friends I like eating out, going to karaoke, picnics, hiking and so forth.I'm not the kind of person who indulges in alcohol drinking much at all, primarily for health reasons and also to the fact that I can't handle my alcohol for shit, so hope that's not an issue to you :pIn terms of what I'm looking for in a domme:I'm expecting a slow, gentle and easy start into the femdom aspect within the relationship. This will give us time to really understand each other on a deeper level. It will also allow me time to adjust into the sub that fits with your expectations.Therefore, I'm totally ok with a domme/mistress figure who's inexperienced or simply just curious to test things out. I'd much prefer that than a full on hardcore domination experience right from the start.Honesty is also highly valued. If there are certain things within the femdom scene that you find uncomfortable, or want to try out, I expect you to speak up, and you should expect me to listen so we can have a proper discussion together on the expectations and limits.The femdom aspects also needn't only exist within the sex scene. The idea is to make you feel comfortable as the leader within the relationship!In terms of age preference, 18-30 would be ideal. I'd prefer to be with someone of similar age as me. It would also be good if you have similar interests as me so we have other things to talk and do together outside of purely the femdom aspect alone. Being Asian would also be a plus :)If this is something that interests you, or you simply want to discuss together in a bit more detail before considering it (those new to femdom, or don't know what it is exactly), feel free to message me so we can discuss it in more detail :DPS. I'd be willing to exchange pictures of Snapchat during the early stages of communication before connecting through other social medium platforms.;

Maybe they secure their banking data but their daily news surfing is unsecured. Or maybe certain adult activity is private, but they still use Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and Google.But your seemingly unimportant data actually tells a lot about you. Possibly things you'd prefer were kept private.For example, once upon a time, a big data analyst at Target figured out that you can tell that a woman is pregnant when she begins to buy certain items, like unscented soap, unscented lotion, and cotton balls. Source: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#708138a46668](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#708138a46668) Think about that. What does unscented lotion have to do with being pregnant? Seemingly not much, although that's probably due to beliefs that unscented products are cleaner and safer for babies. But what about the cotton balls?You might think that it doesn't matter if the databrokers know that you clicked on that website. But what does it say about you? It's not what that particular website says that matters. It's that there's a high correlation between people who click on a particular headline and people who have this particular interest, attribute, etc.The article above was published 8 years ago. How far has technology come since then? How far has artificial intelligence come in terms of making connections in the data, correlating browsing activity with interests? Everything from your personality type to your mental health to your relationships to your political, religious, and sexual preferences. All of it correlated by a super computer that has begun to understand you better than you understand yourself.It is publicly known that Google has given birth to a fully functioning Quantum computer. If you don't know what that is, you might want to look into it. [https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2019-10-23/quantum-supremacy-google-computers](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2019-10-23/quantum-supremacy-google-computers)Let me explain with an analogy. Think back to when you were a child, and you got a maze on the back of a paper menu at a restaurant. You would trace a line down a path until you hit a dead end. Then you'd back up and try a different path. If a Quantum computer were solving this kind of problem, it would be able to try all paths at once. The speed at which it can make calculations is breathtaking.That Google has a functioning Quantum computer is publicly known. We all know, or should know, that just like the US Government (every gov't actually) has classified information, corporations have private, non-public information too. If the fact that Google has a Quantum computer is publicly known, what's actually true behind the scenes? No one knows except those few in the know.I hear people say all the time that Artificial Intelligence can't do this, can't do that, will never replace humans because they can't, can't, can't.Here's the truth: when it comes to big data analytics, these companies are capable of doing FAR more than you can imagine.Personally, I don't think it's a coincidence that Google allowed information about the Quantum computer to leak like they did right when they've been coming under increasing public scrutiny. It's pretty thinly veiled. Imagine the conversation Google can now have with lawmakers as they contemplate whether to regulate them behind closed doors.""But Senator, you now know that we've created the world's first Quantum computer. If you regulate Google or break the company up, we will no longer have the resources to produce this kind of technology, which is so important in our competition with China and Russia.""All data matters. It's all meaningful.";

femdompersonals;hzrxq3;1595987920.0;/r/femdompersonals/comments/hzrxq3/22m4f_athletic_asian_sub_seeking_domme_for/;22[M4F] Athletic Asian sub seeking domme for LTR/play-partner #Sydney; Hi fellow redditors,I'm a submissive Asian (more specifically Chinese) guy from Sydney Australia. I've been interested in the whole femdom area/topic for about 3-4 years now and would love to commit to a FLR, preferably in person, or otherwise an online arrangement can work also. A bit about me:I'm currently 22 years old. In terms of my kinks, I'm interested in chastity, orgasm denial, teasing, edging, strapon-anal (receiving), bondage, cunnilingus being the main ones with some others along the side. My limits include findom, scat, blood.Within an FLR relationship, I think the ideal theme is to allow the girlfriend/wife feel COMFORTABLE and of course empowered. The last thing I would want is to make my domme feel pressured to maintain a dominant composure without enjoying it. As a couple, during the early stages we can learn about each other's limits, expectations and adjust accordingly to have a consensual exchange of power that allows you to feel like a princess/queen, while I learn more about the main, and even smaller things I can do in our relationship to satisfy your desires and meet the expectations that you have bestowed upon me.An idea of me outside of the kink/femdom domain:For work I'm a technical consultant, specialising within the Azure cloud space. I work for a company that is a Microsoft Partner I'm loving my job after understanding the expansive capabilities that can be offered by cloud solutions :D In the future I aspire to fulfill the role of a principal consultant within the cloud space, or other domains that have massive technological influence (namely big data, AI and Machine Learning).I would consider myself fairly ambitious, sporty and outgoing. In terms of sports and exercise, my favourite at the moment is long distance running (Ran the Blackmore marathon :), swimming and weights. Completing a 100km super marathon and an Ironman Triathlon are two major fitness related bucket list goals that I'm working hard on achieving right now. Outside of sports, I like to read, listen to music (primarily Asian music, chillstep etc.). When hanging out with friends I like eating out, going to karaoke, picnics, hiking and so forth.I'm not the kind of person who indulges in alcohol drinking much at all, primarily for health reasons and also to the fact that I can't handle my alcohol for shit, so hope that's not an issue to you :pIn terms of what I'm looking for in a domme:I'm expecting a slow, gentle and easy start into the femdom aspect within the relationship. This will give us time to really understand each other on a deeper level. It will also allow me time to adjust into the sub that fits with your expectations.Therefore, I'm totally ok with a domme/mistress figure who's inexperienced or simply just curious to test things out. I'd much prefer that than a full on hardcore domination experience right from the start.Honesty is also highly valued. If there are certain things within the femdom scene that you find uncomfortable, or want to try out, I expect you to speak up, and you should expect me to listen so we can have a proper discussion together on the expectations and limits.The femdom aspects also needn't only exist within the sex scene. The idea is to make you feel comfortable as the leader within the relationship!In terms of age preference, 18-30 would be ideal. I'd prefer to be with someone of similar age as me. It would also be good if you have similar interests as me so we have other things to talk and do together outside of purely the femdom aspect alone. Being Asian would also be a plus :)If this is something that interests you, or you simply want to discuss together in a bit more detail before considering it (those new to femdom, or don't know what it is exactly), feel free to message me so we can discuss it in more detail :DPS. I'd be willing to exchange pictures of Snapchat during the early stages of communication before connecting through other social medium platforms.;

In fact, a lot of lead generation tools today give you that information.
