BigDataJobs;1ez37k;1369408506.0;/r/BigDataJobs/comments/1ez37k/woohoo_100_readers_in_less_than_24hrs_theres/;Woohoo! 100 Readers in less than 24hrs! There's clearly an interest... share your opinion!;Hello Big Data enthusiasts, In less than 24hrs there are over 100 sub members (and only 90 of them are alts, jk). Please, share your thoughts on how to make this sub-reddit a useful resources, rather than a typical job board. If you have insights on the market, or career thoughts/suggestions, please feel free to post. Though, general discussion should be kept to the original subs. Thanks to all, and hoping to really turn this into something awesome!;I'm an undergraduate student currently hoping to go to grad school for ML, and I want to see what exactly it takes to get a good job in ML. I also want to see if the jobs are worth the cost of getting a PhD in ML.  Thanks for setting up the subreddit!#* How important is a PhD in terms of getting a job? * What if you only have a MS or a BS? #My interest is getting a big job in data.  Where do i get the jobs?#Cost depends on whether you love the subject or not! Don't get the PhD just because you think you'll make more money... doubt that cost/benefit analysis will come out positive. Tuition aside, you're committing to years of school, which have an opportunity cost (i.e. no real income).  For that purpose - you'd be better off just working on your development skills & in particular learning the Hadoop stack. On the other hand, if ML is really interesting to you, regardless of income opportunities, then by all means study it & there will be well-paying jobs available (at least in the right geographies).#PhD is obviously looked upon very highly, and is typically preferred for DS roles.   However, an MS in stats or specialized comp sci degree can be enough for a position.   BS would be impossible unless you were a prodigy/genius of some sort. Simply not enough knowledge at that point. #Thanks - that is good advice! Thanks for mentioning the Hadoop stack.  What geographies do you mean when it comes to good ML opportunities?
datamining;1f6hih;1369713450.0;/r/datamining/comments/1f6hih/big_datas_effect_on_healthcare/;Big Data's Effect on Healthcare;Recently, I have been reading extensively on big data topics, such as business intelligence and predictive analytics. Health analytics struck me as both a fast growing and rewarding field, so my interest peaked upon noticing that Accenture's (my future employer) Analytics sector serves the healthcare industry.While I'm unsure about which healthcare industry (life sciences, public health, health insurance) would be the best to specialize in at the moment, I am quite eager about a consulting career which revolves around big data in healthcare.I just have a couple of questions which I'm hoping that the reddit community can answer for me.1) Have any of you been involved in any projects centered around health analytics? If so, did you enjoy your experience(s) ?2) Which healthcare sectors have the strongest demand for business intelligence / analytics services? Upon speaking to some people, it seems that business with healthcare providers is doing well3) Are there any case studies out there regarding health analytics from a healthcare provider standpoint ?4) What kind of information is data mining used to find in a hospital setting? What are some of the most important data mining methods (clustering, etc) ?;"My data warehousing/data mining professor shared some of his experiences in healthcare with us.  Back in the 80's when relational databases were just barely on their way into popularity, he and his team started leveraging them extensively for business intelligence.  He and his team were able to create analytics where they could identify a path of treatment for a particular patient, and with that they could tell companies something along the lines of: ""One of your employees has entered a course of treatment for HIV/AIDS, and you need to bank $350,000 immediately.""  His lectures were incredibly interesting.  This is but a fraction of what's possible now, but still a very good example of how business intelligence and healthcare can be linked.#I work for a business analytics/big data software company and we have a lot if healthcare clients.  Most hospital use cases have been around analyzing wait times to more effectively manage and in turn reduce wait times.  They also use it for keeping track of patients records so doctors can more quickly analyze a patients history.  We have a lot of webinar and case studies featuring some of our clients on Pentaho.com#I will be covering most of these topics in my lecture on Big Data in healthcare:  http://www.health2con.com/events/conferences/university-courses/  And you should take a look at the Open Data set that I released.   http://docgraph.org  -FT#Thanks for the insight!  Would you know of any good lectures or articles on the web that show how business intelligence and healthcare are linked? Are there any case studies out there?"
BigDataJobs;1exlwx;1369348000.0;/r/BigDataJobs/comments/1exlwx/welcome_to_the_grand_opening_of_the_bigdatajobs/;Welcome to the Grand Opening of the BigDataJobs Sub!;"Hello all ye Reddit Big Data professionals and enthusiasts!This sub has been set up, so as to keep the other Big Data related subs pure. You can come here for all of your employment needs. There are also three separate subs dedicated specifically to Data Science roles, Machine Learning roles, and Software/DB Engineering roles. But feel free to post any BD related roles on this sub... such as Project Manager, Marketing, Product Manager, etc. These subs are open for everyone to use and post jobs as you wish, but just for some basic etiquette:If you're posting a job, please post [Hiring] in the heading. If you're looking for a job, please post [For Hire] in the heading.Also, it would be very beneficial to post your location or the location you're willing to work in. Lastly, I'll try to keep this sub limited only to real Big Data roles versus plain analyst roles. So, before you post, please think about if you actually need a Data Scientist, or if you actually are involved with ""Big Data"". Hope this works out well! ";

KCTech;1hfl07;1372694892.0;/r/KCTech/comments/1hfl07/looking_for_it_guy_that_can_provide_hands_on/;Looking for IT guy that can provide hands on support for server install at KC data center.;We will be installing some servers and equipment at [Joe's Data Center](http://joesdatacenter.com/) in July or August and need the services of a local tech. This would be a great gig for a young IT tech that wants to get some hands on experience and wants to see the inside of a big data center.Basic network experience is all that is required even if it is just your home network. The equipment consists of servers, KVM, switch and firewall and it's probably 2 to 3 hours worth of work at most but we will make it worth your time. We may also need your expertise for future installs or problems.  Normally the techs at the data center will have the servers and equipment in place and all that is required is adding patch cables, etc. The tech's at the Joe's could probably do this for us but we have a fairly robust setup and don't want to overload them with this. Feel free to ask questions here or PM me. Thanks!;Hope Joe's works out for you  I remember they had a lot of bad press a few years back.#I'd do it I've been learning everything I can about network infrastructure and this would be a great opportunity pm with more information please#[deleted]#I personally know joe on the 26th floor, I used to work at wholesale internet under aaron#We've had servers at Joe's for many years and the network has been fine, it's anything else that's the problem, like racking new servers, DC temps, etc. Overall it's no worse or better than a lot of colo's you just have to go with the flow and make things work. And don't tie yourself to one data center. #PM sent, thanks!#Initially it's a few 1U servers, a switch, 16 port KVM and firewall. No software work needed at all. #He's a good guy, seems to be overworked though. #It's when things don't work that they seem to have trouble.  Best of luck to you.#Joe? Awesome guy actually. Very smart and up on his network amd datacenter knowlege, plus a great taste in literature (we share one of the the same books as our favorite, hitchhikers guide) and music. I used to do reboots for him if it was in the dead of night, in return I could smoke ciggys (quit a while back) off of his 26th balcony which was a badass view.#Agreed. Thanks!

They'll train you, and teach you all about the HPC world (think supercomputers and Big Data), GPFS, and file system implementation. You'll:* Be part of engineering team* Interface with clients* Be part of product development* Get to work on projects for DoD, NASA, Fortune 500 companies, etc* 70-80kF1s with ~2 yrs left are welcome to apply!If you're interested, please send me a PM or send your resume to boris@bigresourcing.com;"[deleted]#I'm sorry to tell you, but even for a PhD with no work experience 70-80 is at/above market. :(   If you're coming from an ivy, it could be somewhat more, but not too much. #[deleted]#Again, the answer is it depends. I'm not the one hiring for this position, but am a lowly, yet awesome recruiter, so I do like to be upfront about the details.  That being said, you're overvaluing the market based on your own experiences. A gov't post-grad does NOT get over 90k starting... not unless they have highest clearance level under special circumstances.   1-3 years experience, 90k easy, 3+ years ~120 range. Then it depends on how good you are. I have a guy I'm working with that has around 5 yrs experience but is pulling 170k. The fact is, it completely depends on the person/company. #[deleted]#Thought you meant someone with a post-doc. Doing a post-doc for the gov't could get you that much, but it could also get you less.   Depends on the company, but they could easily give you that raise. Its also a matter of risk/market saturation. 70k is a fine salary, even for Boston. Additionally, anyone just out of university, even with a PhD gets a ton of training. So, why would they pay someone who they'll have to train, and isn't proven to be a good worker (research in school doesn't always translate to being a good worker) ~90k, when they can get someone with several years experience for an extra 10k?   Again, I think your perspective is massively skewed from a relatively narrow experience in the marketplace. We're also not just talking about Physics PhD's, but everyone who has high level math & comp skills. Which, in Boston, is a lot of people.   I'm really not sure who you're refering to as ""these"" companies, because there are very few companies out there that can afford to pay an unproven grad 90k to start, and there are very few grads that would actually deserve that either. #If I may be so bold, what do you do?
