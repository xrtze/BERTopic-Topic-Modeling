guns;865d11;1521663004.0;/r/guns/comments/865d11/external_rgundeals_community/;External r/gundeals community;Hello there members of gunnit! As I'm sure is the same case with many of you I tried to get my fix of the best gun deals today only to find that the subreddit has been banned. I'm toying with the idea of trying to create a replacement website for r/gundeals. I know there are other aggregators out there, but at least in my experience r/gundeals was easily the best. I'm a professional software engineer (more in the big data space, but I know my way around AWS fairly well). Would other devs on r/guns be interested in participating? Open to discussion and suggestions!___________Edit- I've bought a web domain. After chatting with a friend who does web-dev work I got the recommendation to use Nginx backed by NodeJS. Open to discussion on the tech stack! My goal would be to make a site with more or less identical functionality to reddit, with upvoting comments/posts etc. ____Edit2- I have a discord server up now for any devs who want to discuss options. PM me for the link_________Edit3- signing off for the night, will respond to PMs tomorrow._____________Edit4- Please don't ask to join the discord channel if you just want to monitor progress :/. We're looking for contributors!_______________Edit5- Discord channel is getting pretty noisy. We're going to hold off on inviting anyone else in until we can get things organized. All the support is much appreciated!!;"I enjoyed gun deals because it was an easy way to get quick reviews and to find out if the deal was a deal worth jumping on.#Gun.deals is close but I'm sad to see that subreddit go.  It was a great community#Please do. There’s no reason to let this community dissolve because of arbitrary virtue signaling.#I'm a professional software engineer of 3 years, with experience in Swift/Objective-C/PHP/Python/Go. I wouldn't mind working on a 2nd amendment-safe gundeals platform. Hell, I wouldn't mind even working on a platform that combined deals AND videos (since YouTube is now banning gun videos).EDIT: Send me a PM if you'd like to collaborate on something.#Yes! Okay The best part of gundeals was twofold 1) generally, members would post deals they were looking for/thought were good and more members could vote on the deal. This worked out well for visibility as well as affirmation that this is okay to blow my money on 2) the comments would let you know about the product or about the seller. Which also helped in your confidence when buying. These 2 things worked beautifully. If there is anyway to vote and comment on gundeals, COUNT ME IN #Fuck you reddit you fascist cocksuckers#Hell, I'd be willing to pay a buck-or-two/month to have access to a good website doing what gundeals did.gunnit.com's domain is open.#call it r.gundeals.net?#I saw a fourm death turn into a huge business opportunity.  GON (Georgia Outdoor News) had a very active buy/sell section of it's chat forum some years ago.  They took the very short sighted view of shutting it down because moderating was becoming a hassle.  A very smart guy opened The Outdoors Trader.  It is mainly a GA site but it gets incredible traffic and was born by word of mouth advertising.  If you want a p2p gun deal in GA it is the #1 place to shop now.Somebody around here ought to seize the opportunity to make something better than the GunDeals shit fest.  Gun sales are down right now but give it a couple of years...#[deleted]#Wow I just got back from vacation and am completely blown away. What happened that caused Reddit to ban gundeals? That's like 95% of my interest with Reddit. I'm so disillusioned and disappointed with reddit right meow. #I am not a software or programming guru or anything of the sort but as I relatively new firearm owner who enjoyed perusing /gundeals I am quite frustrated in the banning of a sub that linked goods offered by legitimate firearms dealers and offered 2a advocates and arms enthusiasts a place to gather and discuss. I am here to do anything I can to help. Sidenote: Fuck reddit's communist leftist bullshit. #Very sad about the closure of gun deals. Going to be a much more expensive hobby now. Going to be spending a lot less time on Reddit.#I'm also a software developer. It would be awesome to help out here, although I work primarily in the .NET ecosystem. #Can we get a FUCK /u/spez ?#reddit's source code as of the last update (last year) is still available on github, which may simplify things quite a bit for you.https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit#They fucking shut down r/gundeals?! No wonder I couldn't get it to load today. What kind of fucking bullshit is this?!#Why was it banned?#Would totally appreciate something like this, but how would ppl find out about it? I'll prob delete my Reddit due to their crap, but am still looking for other sites like gun deals first. Hell, I'll make a temp private gun deals fb group if anyone even still uses fb#Can’t we just make an app??#App engineer and sysadmin checking in - pm'd. #Can we start a patreon or something so we can help fund this? I loved browsing /r/gundeals and /r/gunsforsale. #[deleted]#DevOps/Eng/Big Data for a Fortune 50. I know people that can help. I set up a Discord, but it seems you did as well.What can I do to help?https://discord.gg/rPHfd6yHop on over to Discord and build a community. Let’s make this happen.#You could always make a discord and have only mod approved posts and links go into a ""gun deals"" channel on there#I wouldnt mind helping, but I have limited html5, css, and javascript skills. Can also help by sharing ideas and so on#What can we do to help? I only have basic IT skills and a little network.#It's not about the technical aspects, or the development.  Software, domain names, hosting don't really matter.  gun.deals (aka slickguns) exists, but that's just aggregating.  What made /gundeals so good was the community.  The discussions, comments, vendor posts, etc.  Creating a new website won't bring that back.  The community was large because of the larger draw of Reddit.  An unknown website just won't have that.  Voat would seem like a logical choice, but it seems they only have one hamster wheel powering the server.  The thing grinds to a halt every time Reddit bans a sub and people look at voat.  If voat worked better, and better organized to seem more professional, it could be the place to grow.  Reddit is just going to keep banning more subs that don't fit the leftist narrative.  Voat feels more like the first attempt at recreating Reddit, like, it feels like it's running on a server in some dude's basement.  A well developed, cohesive, marketable Reddit replacement is needed like yesterday.  Not just the technical development, but brand, logo, name development.  It has to be catchy, memorable, and functional.  Then it needs subs with content, moderation, activity.  Then it needs to be mentioned EVERYWHERE.  Not just for Reddit refugees, but marketed as truly free speech without censorship.  OK, so a new site could work, but it needs to be done right.  Just throwing up ANOTHER website without all the other components has been tried and they never get any momentum.#Be careful, they might decide that with this post you are facilitating the facilitation of facilitating the sale of legal firearms and that's against their rules there buddy.#While I used to do a lot more programming back in the day I am more of in a PM/Director role right now in my job.I will offer to lead the project and get the project organized and off the ground and running up on infrastructure.#Every subreddit worth visiting has disappeared in the past week.  So long Reddit, thanks for all the downvotes.#Anyone consider using MeWe?  'no ads, no tracking, no BS, #not4sale' is their tag line..   The last time I was in there, I needed vaccinations when I came back out, but maybe our community's ""signal to noise"" ratio would be high enough to keep a group 'on topic'. #I'll throw in my software experience into the ring as well. I've seen some pretty good site skimmers when it came to gamestop where people were making thousands in store credit a month just my looking at multiple sites and checking resale value.I'm sure the same can be done with other firearm related websites and hooked into a bot that will post what it finds#And yet SRS is free to insult, harass, and tell people to kill themselves all day long. Fuck /u/spez.#Make a gofund me and I'll donate to help with costs. I need somewhere to declare ""in for three"" and not feel bad about my decision. #r/GunCoupons maybe?Edit: someone just made that one 7 hours ago.  lol#Maybe this ends up being a good thing after the dust settles. U/limeygunner and his team get a website going and companies reach out with deals for promo on the website. Stuff like vendor ratings and other useful info can be built vendor profiles or maybe something like that.I have no computer skills but if there is anyway a normal guy can give you a hand u/limeygunner reach out at anytime!#Fuck the mods.#This needs to happen.  I don't think I'm going to be able to tolerate voat.  Place is a shithole.  And I know if I can't stand it, you all sure as hell won't be able to stand it.#If you build it I will come.#Will the Reddit snu be changing to the virtue signaling snowflake now as well? Asking for a friend.#https://voat.co/v/Gundeals#[deleted]#Freedom hating communist cucks #I had the same idea but lack the skills needed. Sounds like it would work well.#I'd love to have that and r/gunsforsale all in one...  find good retail deals and use the sale area to pay for all the stuff I just bought!#I do Javascript/Typescript, angular, .net, and MS sql. About 3 years professional experience.I've thought about writing my own forum but honestly would it be easier just to get some pre-made stuff?#I am unsure what I can offer, but considering my tremendous love of r/gundeals I'm more than happy to learn, contribute labor, or even contribute money towards paying for a new community#I know a few programming languages and would love to get back into programming.  I’m currently a help desk tech.  #If you make a new gun deals and possibly guns for sale page, I'll be one of the first to sign up.#I'd love if there is a historical low functionality when given a upc or manufacturer model. would be excellent for that.#Comment and saved for later #Plz I'm starting to itch #I just wanted to say that you’ll definitely get my traffic if it’s set up like the original r/gundeals. As others have said I really enjoyed the community feel to it and the ability for others to tell you wether or not it was actually a good deal. #Operatorchan.org#u/limeygunner I'm more than happy to help out with development/server costs and/or a monthly fee.#Saving for future hopes.#I'm taking the money I saved on r/gundeals and putting toward gun organizations now. All of them. #Maybe a subreddit for general collaboration and sharing ideas for creating new sites?#Definitely interested. I'd be willing to chip in on domain costs too if it meant having gun deals back#Spread the word. We have a discord server to help out with deals and such. Hey OP, maybe add this to the original post?https://discord.gg/9KuQja5#You have got to be fucking kidding me, what the fucking fuck #Can we do a discord #What is the domain so I can save it? Also where do you plan on providing updates?  This may have been mentioned but, it would be great if there was a place I could go that would wrap YouTube & reddit into one clean functioning website created by people who stand up for the constitution and what this country was founded on. I’m definitely looking forward to this new community  keep us updated. #The nice thing about /r/gundeals is that it wasn't greatly known outside of this community and a few others. Don't know what others think about this idea but I like the idea of either invites or a Ranking system/reputation that way it doesn't just get destroyed!#I'm not interested in being a dev, but I'm all in for joining the community! #I'm not really a great web dev i've only dabbled a little bit but if there's anyway I can help I'm game!#this is amazing! thank you!#not all heroes wear capes /u/limeygunner I appreciate you#This will probably get buried, but just to let you guys know I'm a learning software dev and would love any chance I can get to get some real-world experience in coding and web development, especially with something I'm passionate about.If there's anything I can do to help the team, I'd love to learn more in how I can do so.#Fairly skilled with PowerShell scripting and some python and bash. Give me a shout if you need someone to automate mundane bullshit#Can't someone just make a new one with a different, less conspicuous name? #>My goal would be to make a site with more or less identical functionality to reddit, with upvoting comments/posts Call it Voat.co#Www.Voat.com/v/gundeals#Just start posting gun.deals to T_D. That traitorous sub is all fine in Reddits eyes. •Only -10. Thought y’all brigaded better than that. #The 'user reviews' and content of the subreddit was amazing, not to mention the wealth of knowledge you could find in it - and people were always out there price checking a posted deal to see if another was around, not the same as gun.deals but I look forward to seeing another version pop up #Isn't this somewhat how slickguns worked before it changed to gun.deals? Or was it never forum based?#Yup. Always checked the comments to see what everyone else thought about the deal. If the community agreed that it was stellar, I would often pull the trigger (pun intended) on the purchase. The sub being shutdown will be a plus for my wallet, but just another strike for Reddit and the bullshit we've become accustomed to. This site is fuckin cancer anymore, with an overall hive mind mentality. Fuck u/spez #I've purchased a lot more off /r/Gundeals than gun.deals. #[deleted]#Believe me, it won't go anywhere permanently. Where there is a demand, there will become a supply.#I browsed r/gundeals at least once a day and was my primary source for all my builds. Loved the community and the deals all the same. #I think the main problem is getting the user base to move over, which is why we browsed the sub, vs gun.deals or something similar.#Reddit has code posted on GitHub. May be a blessing to clone the format of Reddit even#Web dev here.  Mostly JavaScript and front end related stuff.  Id be down to clown. I was thinking a firebase application with a realtime database allowing users to submit deals which would show up instantly on the users screen.  Authentication is easy.  This could be done without any server side architecture necessary and hosted for free as a beta then if it starts to gain traffic, move over to something scalable like AWS.#Same. WTB project lead.PM me as well as them ^^#Now theres a great idea. I'd contribute ( de monatized youtuber and gundeals retailer ) #Pls do! #Sorry about the PHP bro. As a .NET Dev, I don't feel your pain#maybe i...zuck ya dick?#Yes we need that!!#Zero software experience here.

However, it would only take a small percentage of of /r/gundeals 130k+ subscribers to overwhelm the current ~500 on v/gundeals, at least half of which already came from reddit in the past 2 hours#That looks promising. Voat seems to think of Reddit Refugees as second class posters, but we could take over their gun subs and create ones that Reddit has where Voat has gaps. I'm already contacting Voat to see if I can take over some other subs that are shut down to see if they can be resurrected. Be the change you want to see in Voat. #So is there any way we can brigade voat and not play into their stupid racist/bigoted shit? Greeting people with “hey faggot, I’m new here too” is most certainly not what I want to be a part of, nor is it the image that our community wants to give off. Can we maybe start a signup page/sheet here on /r/guns that shows our Reddit username and related voat username, and all agree to not be assholes? #[deleted]#Karl Marx wrote that common workers should be armed.#Voat showed up first to save the day , so go there. Don't break into small groups #/r/fun_deals#I imagine it would get reported eventually... whack a mole game#One of the common symptoms of TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) is the inability to carry on normal conversations without injecting Trump into the discussion. These people are known for trying to do whatever possible to steer the discussion towards Trump, no matter how unrelated it may be. Victims of TDS should seek help immediately as it can have negative affects on their social interactions with their friends, family, and community. The biggest obstacle in most victims of TDS is that they are completely unaware of their condition and think everyone else is constantly obsessing over Trump and also suffering from TDS. A simple exercise can be to leave echo chambers and try meditation. Hobbies such as knitting also help. #hey look a retard.#Yeah but it was easier for people to comment on Reddit because of the amount of screen time here than it was to login to slickguns#Oh same here for sure.

Beretta had a code for 25% off their entire website and I was able to purchase some 92S compatible Beretta mags for $17 each. I didn't see that posted on Gun.deals. Same goes for the SiG website. They had those $5 AR mags that didn't get posted to gun.deals until they were practically sold out. If it wasn't for /r/gundeals I would've missed out on that.I've noticed that Gun.deals is very partial to Brownells/Cabelas/Natchez and other major firearms-related retailers. Deals from smaller websites and storefront-only merchants either never get posted or get posted once and then never posted again. But the ""deals"" from major retailers get reposted daily and are sometimes the only things that get posted along with the occasional Amazon junk.RIP Gundeals you will be missed#> /r/GunDealsAnnouncementsHoly fuck man that was MY FUCKING SUB.

Just similar to what they do here.  I would start with a web app. Just make it mobile responsive so people can use it via mobile as well.Advertising can come when we need it.  Server costs would be pretty small at the beginning. $25 a month for firebase with their mid tier plan.  It allows for 100k simultaneous users a day and 250k reads off of the database per day.  That being said, all of it can be started for free. Once it receives the amount of traffic where it warrants upgraded stuff, then we worry about paying for costs.

I'll be avoiding that since I can get enough of that bs on Reddit.#Read the comments on the gundeals sub haha#Voat is a shithole website with shithole users. You have to have so many upvotes to your comments before you can take over a sub. So I start commenting, and they recognize that I am a Reddit Refugee and downvote everything mercilessly. The only way I would take it seriously would be if a bunch of gun Reddit users were to go there together and insist that the gun subs would be modded by people who weren't anti-semetic assholes. I don't know if that's spelled right, but it wasn't hyperbole. Voat users pride themselves on behaving like 12 year old CoD players. I'm all for a good laugh, but racist, homophobic language is a real turn off. Voat is only feasible if Reddit users can take over particular subs. Otherwise, count me out. #I was for a while, then I just never turned off the script. #I just hate seeing people going along with the “welcome to voat, faggot” stuff. None of that is necessary. I’d be better to see our redditors go over and post sensible stuff, and completely ignore the crazy bigoted bullshit mouth breathers that are there now. We don’t need to be assholes to post and upvote.#Of course you like to fucking knit#Yes, I dictated it to her because she's better at typing than me. #I never noticed much conversation on gun.deals.

I have been approached by the owner of a similar start-up social media platform interested in having /r/gundeals move over, who said we was also in discussion with their mods.I am doing my best to fight to get our sub back, while also working on contingencies.#Sounds great!

My understanding is all of the harshness they're exhibiting now is kind of a litmus test. If you leave, they didn't want you around anyway.I don't agree with it, but that's apparently what's happening. #You are a brave person.#The gundeals sub has been fairly apolitical so far and it doesn't have the upvote requirements to submit like Voat does.#Alright so someone said ""faggot"", let's just abandon the sub. Seriously it's not a huge deal, don't make it into one because you're supposed to.#Well I’m there now. I’m hoping more join. If you comment on any of my stuff I’ll upvote you. My username is the same over there. Now I have a more immediate issue to deal with.... my dog just got sprayed by a skunk. #What is your username over there?#You should try it sometime!#Are your arms broken?#I agree on gun.deals.

I'm sure they're in contact with more mods in their communities.Also I'd like to say that I really don't envy your position right now, but I'm really glad you're not giving up and are taking up the responsibility for all of us, and for that I thank you, and wish you luck!

It's liberals that want the state to have a monopoly on violence. Marx and Engels both wrote several times that the people must not be unarmed. #You're absolutely correct#I really don't care. Leftists can go fuck themselves, I'd rather deal with the moronic edgelords.#1. I never said anything about abandoning the sub, you were implying ""the shithole parts"" were seperate from the gun deals sub which is not true.2. Racism and homophobia may not be ""a huge deal"" to you, but I don't support that or have any interest in reading it. Not sure what you mean by ""because you're supposed to"", some people have personal convictions and beliefs formed by themselves, not because someone told them to.#Its a lot worse that that..#Tomato juice!#CoffeeSwirls#Furiously beating off to a shirtless man with his hand up the ass of an orange puppet. #We are but there are so many gun forums out there that we didn't know if we truly needed to include the gunnit communities, as they are twice the size of basically all of our groups combined. /u/nauticalmile pm me if you want more of a run down.#[deleted]#Fuck commies. You all deserve a bullet in the head. #Fair enough.#Yea seriously. Going to get it now. Great ending to a day. This is not something I wanted to deal with tonight. #Alright as soon as I figure out how to search for users I’ll message you & upvote (or if you figure it out first let me know)#The thing is that I'm not the exception to the group I belong to. There are lots of modern day, not historical, communists who are anti gun control but feel uncomfortable joining pro-gun activities because of the way that we are treated. Redneck Revolt and the Socialist Rifle Association are two groups who routinely fight against gun control and the disarmament of the proletariat. Furthermore I'm also a Gun Owners of America member.Saying that this is a thing that communists want or support is simply   untrue. #Out of curiosity, what is your problem with communists?  I'm not a communist myself, hell I don't even know what I am politically anymore, but to see such hatred for a set of ideas has me curious.#Sorry for being hostile. It's just after the last month/year/decade and the left's new push to ostracize and demonize gun owners,where I'm as of yesterday retreating to fucking voat and today it's cutting up my Citi credit card. I'm not seeing, as a conservative libertarian, how being civil with the left has been, in any way, productive.#Thank you, I appreciate it. #That's understandable, the anti-gun US liberal-left wing is pretty toxic and I don't like to engage with them. I've found I end up getting along more with libertarians/pro-gun anarchists than anti-gun liberals. Raddle has some censorship regarding racism, but its has an anarchist/anti-authoritarian bent in regards to use of direct democracy, transparency of mod/admin decisions, protection of user privacy via warrant canary, and doesn't sell user information or make policies to be more accommodating to advertisers.That said, if Voat works out more power to you."

Even moreso now that the leveling is nerfed due to the bounties not giving exp (so the burst is somewhat questionable).Essentially it plays like a jungle LC where you have another core, it's not really a roaming pos 4 though and shouldn't be taken that way. Pos4 sets up the kills for mid/safe, not the other way around. #Well my point is that you build the model, and then check if the results are correct and _also_ that you're getting the answer for the right reasons.

learnprogramming;84v9h8;1521205529.0;/r/learnprogramming/comments/84v9h8/java_or_c_which_should_i_use_to_learn_more_inside/;Java or C#? Which should I use to learn? More inside.;I read the best way to learn programming is to have projects in mind you want to work on, or build out as you learn - to enforce the material and methods. I have no interest in web dev, or big data or anything. I just want to build good ol' fashion desktop apps and maybe some games. The most obvious choices I think for that is Java (and then spring or JavaFX) or C#. Here is what I know so far: Java is is gigantic. It's everywhere and thus, quality, free learning material is available everywhere. The Java ecosystem is mostly free (the IDE, the frameworks etc) and it's platform agnostic. My thoughts on it: The IDE's are simple enough (eclipse anyway is easy to get around) and I have a good udemy course to work through. The company I work for, half of our corporate stack is built off Java so I have a chum to use as a resource when I get stuck. Java is good for desktop app programming. Games? I'm not so sure. However, the added bonus is if I get bored or want to expand/pivot, I have Android development at my reach. C#: The other half of my corporate environment is getting heavy into the MS Stack. All our new projects are hosted on Azure. We have MS partnership status. I have access to Visual Studio, and all the neat MS tools. I have access to other friends who work on the 'new' side to lean on for help. C# and Visual Studio are apparently easy to use for desktop application building, but more importantly once I get my core fundamentals down, I can start looking at things like Unity to build fun games with - which there are a TON of info on. However, C# is significantly smaller than Java (as far as I know anyway) so it sort of feels like I might be pidgen-holing myself into somewhat of a niche?I feel that the QUALITY of my learning experience, and learning core, fundamental programming techniques will probably come better through the use of Java. I think going through C# might be too purpose-driven...if that makes sense. But I'm very interested in learning how to make desktop apps and games as a time-consuming hobby. I have full blown access to both, to in-person support and a list of core projects I want to look into. I just don't know where to start - or with which language/stack? Thanks so much! edit: I didn't expect this to get as much traction as it did. Thanks to everyone who gave input! I'm trying out C# tonight. Will report back Monday with how far I got and what I think. ;"C# is not small.You can't go wrong with either one.They are almost the same language. If you know Java, you can switch to C# quite easily and the other way as well. #>However, C# is significantly smaller than Java (as far as I know anyway)It's ""significantly smaller"" in the way that Target might be significantly smaller than WalMart. There are still Targets everywhere. Java is everywhere, but .NET isn't actually that far behind, and it will only continue growing now that .NET Core is taking off.>I think going through C# might be too purpose-driven...if that makes senseIt really doesn't. I don't know what point you're trying to make here. C# and Java are relatively similar languages, especially at the learner's level. What one language will teach you about ""fundamental programming techniques"" the other will.I'm  hyping C# because I'm a C# developer by trade (though I've done a lot more Javascript lately). But the truth is, you literally can't make a wrong choice between the two. They're both powerhouses in the industry.#If you're interested in going into development as a career, look at job postings in your area. I went to a bootcamp that has two locations. The location I went to taught us C# because that's what the market is like in my area. The location two hours away from me teaches Java because that's the market over there. Both are great options, but knowing what your area needs could give you some insight.#C# for games you have Unity, Godot, Duality Engine, Otter 2D, Xenko game engine, and monogame   you can build desktop apps and connect to any database Visual Studio community edition is free and has everything you'll need there are tons of tutorials on youtube C# is the easy choice I think #Do C# first. They are very similar, but C# is better for your requirements.Neither are niche. Both are cross-platform, multi-purpose, and have broad adoption. C# does desktop apps. It even does Android. https://www.xamarin.com/platformI think you're going to have more luck asking people about their new work projects with C# than their legacy work in Java.And finally, you said games. And for desktop games, Unity with C# is ""the"" way to get into that.I used Java throughout my college coursework and used C# professionally.#Im a C# developer.The efforts it takes to make a C# WPF app function and compile and deploy are pretty streamlined.Everytime we've inherited a Java program and I had to actually open it up and try running it I've never been able to just get the damn thing to run first time.Had to jump through a bunch of hoops, download and install random stuff, update something, deal with the fact my version was a .1 off from the one the guy who did the work on the project had...It's been a constant headache.Really what it comes down to is Visual Studios Nuget Package Manager. It's pretty powerful.When I run a C# project in VS, Nuget checks all my packages and fetches them on demand and everything installs itself.I have just found Java IDEs to be cumbersome and awkward and have never found anything that compares to Visual Studio + Resharper.For Perl, Python, Javascript/Node, etc I use Visual Studio Code to great success due to how lightweight it is.In my two years of professional work I can safely say I have never had a positive interaction with Java.#C# feels like Java but much cleaner. Plus it's been growing significantly over time. If you can write code in one, you can write in the other. I'd go with C# because of its growing popularity.#I'm still in college. I've worked with both Java and C#, and I find C# to be a lot nicer, easier to use, more intuitive. Also C# seems to be the more 'modern' language, with a lot of new features being added. #If you know one, the leap to the other is not that difficult.I'd say C#. Java is a pretty bloated beast if a language and ""lots if info"" doesn't always translate to ""lots of *good* info.""#With ASP.NET Core, C# is going to become more and more prevalent. I think it’s a great language, and was really easy for me to learn, whereas I had trouble with python and ruby. Python and Ruby are great because their syntax is simple, but I was always lost a little because I didn’t know what it was doing behind the scenes, and while C# does this too, I felt like i understood what I was doing more with C# than the other two.I have no experience with Java, so I can’t make a recommendation other than I enjoyed learning C# and found it easy to work with.#Doesn't matter. Pick one and learn the ins and outs of software development as a general idea.#[deleted]#I think Javas great to learn as it shares a lot with other languages making it easy to pickup new tech.  But I would not want Java to be my main trade#It's not a zero sum game. Pick either. Once you know one you can get going with the other if you like in a couple of weeks.#Okay, I'll break it down. Choose whichever one, it doesn't even matter that much, then learn *programming*, as in loops, ifs, conditionals, the whole mindset, and not just some silly language and syntax. Syntax is easy, it's the problem solving and thinking, the semantics, that's the important part. #I would go the C# route. It's much more easier to use than Java. Just about every Java app I have ever used, was slower than crap. Now if you ever plan to lean towards Android then I'd say learn Java.#I think C# is easier to learn and you can do just as much with is as you can with Java, and arguably you could get your foot in the door at more up and coming promising companies using C# - especially if you want to go the game dev route. #Based on what you want to do with your knowledge I would say learn C#, Java is more for enterprise applications and doesn't have as many options as C# in the game engine space. The languages are similar enough that once you have experience in C# if you did want to move to Java it would not be a difficult process. #I wrote in both pretty heavily from 2005-2008.    I have no idea what they're like now, but I felt that C# was a better-designed language for OOP back then.    Like someone else mentioned, getting Java set up on my computer was a lot simpler *(at least back then)* than making sure .NET was up to date, etc. And there were a lot more libraries and services meant for Java back then, as well.  The *""#""* came from the language design team adding another *""++""* to *""C++""*, and then stacking the second set of two plus-signs on top of the first set, creating an octothorp/pound/number/hashtag sign.    Anyway, having come from C++ before those starting those two languages, I thought that was a nifty little tidbit.    These days, C# seems to have become a de-facto language for indie game programming, and .NET Core seems to be solid for web development.    Java, OTOH, is the de-facto language for native Android development.    So aside from a preference for certain syntax or language features, the type of work you plan on doing is also worth taking into consideration.#I started with learning Java and switched to C#.  I wish I had started with C#.  VS is amazing to work with and I can create apps for any platform, it's easier (for me) to digest.#This is the first time I've ever heard C# is small or tedious.#MS tools (with the exception of vs code) are clunky, slow, and inelegant. C# is no exception. It's a mess just like windows and the only realistic use of it is for game dev. Learn java.#I learned C# in the last year and a half by writing desktop apps where I work. The thing I miss about the Linux environment is the git CLI (which you can still use, even on windows, just not where I work). Literally the only thing I don't care for in VS 2012 Professional is the version control. It's not great. That said, the Nuget package manager is legit. It's really really nice to be able to grab things like Spire, PdfSharp, office interop, and on and on. Plus I have been working on an IoT project which means I can load Rpi gateways with windows IoT and use mono to talk directly to sql databases. You get the power and flexibility of embedded devices with direct .NET support. Whut!?!? Testing projects are now available in visual studio community version (at least I know it is for 2017) which is really nice. I highly recommend at least learning test driven development, even if you aren't really strict on it at first. I don't know what kind of IDE you'd use in Java, but if you're making windows forms applications it's very hard to beat C# + visual studio. You literally drag and drop stuff into the editor, double click on it, and it creates the method for the control. It's very slick. Happy coding!#C# is far superior. I've worked with both languages for over a decade now as a consultant. #Unless you really want to embrace cross platform C# is better IMHO.  As others have said though, they're similar. I had Java in college and was easily able to pickup C# on my own.#A lot of people have given great advice on Java vs C# so I'd like to help you out with some advice for the future. You said you have no interest in web but keep in mind that is where everything is heading. More and more desktop apps are getting replaced by html5 web apps that people prefer to use because 1) they don't have to install anything and 2) it's pretty easy to make them work on desktop browsers AND phones. Even when it comes to game development, more and more people are just writing them with webGL (except for the big heavy games for now). Now I'm not saying to give up on the idea of learning C# or Java right now. I'm just warning you to prepare yourself for the reality that you may have to become a ""web developer"" in the future if you want to stay relevant as a developer even for the things you want to do. If it means anything, I'm telling you this as a Java developer who enjoys developing in Java#*grabs popcorn*#Is it just me or is C# and Java basically the same language? I've legitimately never seen two languages that were both so big and so similar#IMHO, Java.#Your opinions are leaning towards Java, so pick that and run and stop trying to convince yourself out of it!Even if it was the wrong choice (it's not), time spent learning it is time better spent than deciding what language to use. Once you are proficient switching shouldn't be an issue.#Don't be a pussy and learn C++.  Java is owned by Oracle and those motherfuckers don't give a shit about anything but milking his customer's tits dry.  Microsoft owns C#, so there is a risk they will become the next Oracle.  If you still want to learn Java or C# do it for the money.   #Python.#Python#Python#Totally agree if you can know one you can essentially straight writing the other immediately.#Agreed with this one. Both have similar syntax. If you learn Java your can learn C# without any difficulty.#Java might be more ubiquitous as far as existing code, but in my anecdotal experience there are far more job openings for C# than Java.#One barrier I do find with the microsoft stack is how tedius, difficult it is to find what I need, install software or generally manage my account with them. The one thing that was blissful with Java was installing Eclipse, the JVM and RJE was a 2 minute process...for someone who's never done it before. When I last tried installing Visual STudio, I remember it being multiple GIGS to download, and I needed to make a microsoft acount, then that account didnt' work, and I had to fiddle with all this junk just to get going.. just to start. IT left a sour taste. But the stack itself is appealing for the reasons I've outlined above. Grrrr... so torn. #[deleted]#I live in a small city sadly, so this likely wouldn't migrate into a career for some time. I have a decent career at the moment and simply have had an interest in coding for a long time. If I got good enough where the tools, apps or games I make garner interest from recruiters, or hiring managers in my own company then hey, cool. Otherwise it's mostly for my own cerebral exercise and creative outlet.  #Yep.  Do you want to work in the Midwest?  Learn C#.  Microsoft has done a fabulous job of convincing Midwest companies to give them all their money.    Do you want to work on the West Coast?  Learn Java.  West Coast companies use Linux and Java because they're a powerful yet frugal option.    Do you want to work on the East Coast?  Don't ask me, I've never worked there.#Awesome, thank's so much! I'm in the process of bookmarking my ""intro C#"" stuff now to start going through tonight. #[deleted]#Visual Studio is a big selling point for C#. There is no equivalent Java IDE that I have found so far that does things as well as Visual Studio.That being said, Visual Studio is large and has so many options that starting developers can get lost in it. I haven't had that issue when writing Java programs, because you have more control over what goes where.#After using Java for like 8 years and C# for the last year, I'm in love with C#. I like it more than Java despite the fact that they're really similar. My only complaint is that everything is in PascalCase instead of camelCase. It's hard to differentiate between classes and methods that way. In Java, only classes are in PascalCase and everything else is camelCase. #Preach on brother. I'm going with C# for the following reasons: * It's the new direction my company who employs me is going so I have a) resources locally to bug for help and b) the option to migrate into a dev role there if this really took off* I want to eventually try and make games (just for fun, no aspirations to found the next Blizzard here) and C# seems to be the go-to for that. At least for desktop. * I want something modernBest of luck!#Not true anymore, unless you need a native GUI framework. You can compile .Net to native code for Linux and Mac these days (runtime built into the executable) so end users don't even need to install the runtime. Asp.Net also has a good *nix story.#1. You could always use posh-git installed as a module for the CurrentUser scope, and then use the terminal in VS to get your git CLI.2.

A real good Java dev is VERY in demand.#Yep. If you write a lot of code in both, you can sometimes catch yourself with compiler errors by accidentally intermingling syntax. Lol.#That’s mainly because Microsoft’s original intention was to make a Java-like language that they could integrate with Windows. #I just want this to supplement my Fortran. #Insightful. Especially with a throwaway. #But it’s never about the syntax. It’s about the libraries and frameworks. Sure you can learn any language quickly but to actually use it is a very different thing. #Not with my experience. I hardly ever see C# openings. Most people avoid the Microsoft stack like the plague. Anyone that has adopted it is typically going to be super corporate and old school. To the OPs original question I wouldn't even give it a thought. Java all the way. It will open up so many doors to other industries.#[deleted]#It's because Visual Studio is for **everything**. It's for professional devs who spend their entire day using it.Just use  .NET Core and VS Code.#installing VS is easy just go here https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/ and grab the 2017 community edition install the installer and choose which components you want: C#, C++, Visual Basic, Mobile, SQL Server, Web Server ... you want C# --- that's it  #> One barrier I do find with the microsoft stack is how tedius, difficult it is to find what I need, install software or generally manage my account with them.While this might have been true in the past, they've done a lot of work to streamline this process and make it much easier.

The experience is much cleaner.#Installing the IDE is probably the easiest thing you will have to do.#VS 2017 is a much faster install now than the previous versions... and prettier while doing it too#Although I've only got some mild experience in Java (I am in the industry, I just don't work in a OO language), from the answers I'm reading here from people, it seems like it's better to just start sooner with either than to start later with ""the perfect language"".  Especially since the two languages follow the same general principles. So based on this comment, I would go for Java.  Seems like it'll get you started faster.#> One barrier I do find with the microsoft stack is how tedius, difficult it is to find what I need, install software or generally manage my account with them. Yeah, I've faced the same problem. I was trying to learn Windows mobile programming. Gave up on that after a couple of hours.You should be able to download VS or VS Express without an account and start coding on that. Or you can just use Java. #If java was easier go with java. They're both widely used and they're so similar you should have no problem using C# if you decide to make a game in unity.#Why not IntelliJ IDEA? It’s a great IDE.#Neither of those things is exactly true. First, you don't need to use Visual Studio  it's simply the best experience available for C# development. Jetbrains has a C# IDE called Ryder which is also very good, there's VS Code, and there's also literally any text editor and a command line. Second, with .NET Core, C# can be run on Mac or Linux. Granted, not desktop applications like you're interested in, but console and web server applications can.#C# is now platform agnostic with .net CoreSource: I deploy my Asp.net stuff to Linux Dockers now.#If this is the case, you should just pick one and go with it. The concepts that you learn are the important bit, not the actual stack you are developing in. Honestly, if you want to just get going I'd pick an interpreted language like JavaScript or python because you can start making things almost instantaneously.  But once again outed not about the language, so flip a coin if you'd like. Good luck, and don't forget to post here when you get stuck#there's plenty of C# jobs on the west coast https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=C%23&l=Los+Angeles%2C+CA#As a student looking for internships on the East coast I've seen significantly more postings for Java, although this is purely anecdotal so take it with a grain of salt.#> Do you want to work on the East Coast?

Pushing large repos \- ignoring sub directories \- and just the hyper productive shorthand notation of the command line is at full disposal in my native envrionment. Gahh. So slick. #You can also use Git with visual studio team services. It's pretty legit. I'd check it out. Git is language agnostic, and vsts is pretty much as well. If you do go this route, be sure to grab the Git credential manager. #If you're running windows 10 you can even enable the windows subsystem for Linux. From there pushing is as easy as making the commit and then pushing to your repo. Git has a great tutorial. You should set up your Linux environment with your user name and remote repo and go over the basics in their tutorial. Good stuff. So if I were your coach I'd have you combine all of this in one go Do the Vending Machine kata exercise. You'll use git, test driven development, and your language choice to create an object-framed virtual vending machine step by step. It's a good exercise. https://github.com/guyroyse/vending-machine-kata#just install git. I recommend working from the command line....here's why:1) GUI version control is mostly shit. It takes too long, it's clumsy, you have to fumble for controls. It is not consistent across editors. Not great. That said, you could do worse than git and visual studio's interface, for sure. 2) You always know, from any environment, across multiple platforms, how to commit, fork, clone, etc. That's extremely valuable. 3) As a general rule, I like to know how to navigate ANY environment without a mouse. Why? Because there will be a day when you remote into a machine and the response time is complete shit. Did it take the mouse click? Is it processing? What the fuck is happening? IS THIS THING ON? Working from the command line eliminates ALL of the guesswork. We know exactly what the fuck is happening. We get debug messages. If the input/arguments is/are fucked up, we know immediately. There is no Windows/Linux graphics display getting bogged in some other (largely unknown) operation. So for this same reason, I use total commander rather than file explorer. I know the keystrokes to transfer, copy, etc files in a dual display type of environment - again....with the idea that if I have to remote into a machine, I never have to wait on the cursor to perform *x*. Right? I always know the command is sent, I know the status, I know everything in real time - or at least as fast as it can relay that information back to me, which is the REAL ceiling we are working with. Not the relayed graphical display. TLDR  Install git, no matter the platform and work from the command line. Use total commander (or similar) instead of Windows/File Explorer#Fortran IV? or Fortran 77?:)#I know Java, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Python, Go, Bash idk like a dozen more it doesn't really matter.

Python;876msl;1522040843.0;/r/Python/comments/876msl/sanic_python_web_server_thats_written_to_die_fast/;Sanic: python web server that's written to die fast;"Performance of Sanic-based web servers is pretty good, sure.The only problem is that people want not only fast but stable servers.From this perspective the Sanic is awful.Malicious software can crash any Sanic server easy by out-of-memory error.Let me analyze several different attack vectors:1. Send a POST to any (even not existing) PATH.   Push ""Content-Length"" HTTP header with the maximum available value   without sending a body.   You should discover what is a maximum allowed size for POST HTTP   body.  Sanic by default limiting it down to insane 100 megabytes   but Reverse Proxy Server like NGINX may reduce it to more   reasonable 1 MB for example. Even 1 MB is enough.   Now we have 2 options:    a. Without closing the connection open as many concurrent      connections as you can and push all of them into the state when      HTTP headers are sent but HTTP body transition is postponed.      Pretty classic attack for locking all TCP ports on a server by      opened idle connections.      Sanic will drop the connection after 60 seconds by default but       a minute may be enough for pushing the server into Deny-Of-Service      state. The problem is not specific to Sanic, consequences are      relative innocent.   b. The more interesting case is sending *almost whole BODY* but without      a couple bytes at the end.      In fact, Sanic performs a routing and request handling only after      fetching the whole BODY.      It means that BODY is COLLECTED IN MEMORY before starting of      PATH/HEADERS analyzing and processing.  You can declare 100 MB      request's BODY, send 99 MB of garbage random data and stop      sending after that.      Open another concurrent request and do the same. Repeat multiple      times. Most likely the server will run out of memory *before*      getting run out of free ports.      Why out-of-memory error is more harmful than free-ports      problem?  Because of it, not only web process(es) stops      processing incoming requests but the whole server goes to      unresponsible state: physical memory is out, everything becomes      swapped to disk, CPU is overheated by kernel swapper worker, as      the result even connecting to a problematic server by SSH becomes      deadly slow.      The problem can be reduced by adding monitoring tools for      looking at Sanic processes memory and killing problematic web      workers. But default configuration has no such monitors.      I bet that most web servers in the world are not configured      properly (at least very many of them).  Also killing a web      process is a painful procedure, sometimes is not easy to      distinguish normal occasional high memory consumption from      malicious attack. As result, normal processing of user data will      be killed.2. Use Sanic streaming.   Sanic has Response Streaming feature.  It is widely used to   download big data, video streaming etc.   Assume you know that https://server.com/video is a resource name   for video stream powered by Sanic.   How to screw it up?  Really very easy.   Connect to the server by regular GET https://server.com/video and   read body SLOWLY.   Sanic has no Flow Control for streaming data (in fact it has no   flow control at all).  Data is sent to a peer when the next data chunk   is available.  If TCP socket's Write Buffer is overloaded -- the   data is pushed into process memory.  If HTTP peer (browser or   another client) consumes stream slower than Sanic produces it --   Sanic process will end up with out-of-memory eventually.   The problem is very dramatic because it doesn't need a malicious   software to reproduce -- just slow network connection between   client and server is enough to explode the bomb.   As result, a streaming in Sanic is broken by design, the feature   usage is very dangerous even if nobody wants to knock out your   server -- it will be demolished by an innocent client with slow   network.What to do?Unfortunately, problems described above are architectural problems ofSanic framework, they cannot be solved on the user side.Moreover, fixing is not possible without changing Sanic public API.Good news: Sanic development team runs so fast that new backwardincompatible changes can land into master without any deprecationperiod and related procedures. They did it several times, the project isstill in beta stage.The only real protection can be done Right Now is *limiting a memoryacquired by Sanic process*. Better to kill an eager process than allowit to grab all memory with dying not only the Sanic process but the wholeserver.Graceful restart could be very complicated but even rough""kill -9"" is better than nothing.A careful review of configuration parameters for both Sanic and ReverseProxy (like NGINX) is also very important.";"This is exactly the kind of post I've been missing from r/python in the last year or so. Thanks for taking the time out to write it and thanks for posting! #Who learned something new? I certainly did, thanks :)Bonus: ""Sanic development teams runs so fast""I'm thinking... perhaps you could provide some nginx configuration that could mitigate some of these problems?#As much as I appreciate this post, I feel like you should probably add a disclosure that you maintain a competing async web framework.At the heart of this, isn't this just a case of slow loris? Now, given sanic shouldn't need the body to perform routing unless it's attempting to do multiple dispatch  based on content of the body (which is silly, don't do that). #Very interesting, thank you! I haven't ever made what could be called a ""production app"", fortunately, but I do mess around with sanic a lot and it's nice to see what's wrong with it. Might you consider bringing these points up to the sanic team directly?#> Good news: Sanic development team runs so fast that new backward incompatible changes can land into master without any deprecation period and related procedures. The sarcasm. I can sense it#That’s why I would always use aiohttp as an async web framework. Might lose some of the nice features included in Sanic, but it appears to be much more reliable.#Sanic maintainer here.>Good news: Sanic development team runs so fast that new backward incompatible changes can land into master without any deprecation period and related procedures. They did it several times, the project is still in beta stage.We encourage people to pin releases to improve reliability. We see master as a development branch. Not sure how you're facilitating this on aiohttp, but nobody told people to use the master branch for a reliable release in the sanic repo.Regarding>The problem can be reduced by adding monitoring tools for looking at Sanic processes memory and killing problematic web workers. But default configuration has no such monitors.That can be reduced by configuring the request body memory limit. See the following for an example:https://github.com/channelcat/sanic/blob/06d46d56cd4e20850019f0b096c1e26e145f853a/tests/test_payload_too_large.py#L8In general, I would discourage using monitoring/alerting here, and encourage people to use multiple memory limited sanic processes (hint cgroups) rather than monitoring/alerting around this issue. Think 12 factor app, [section 6](https://12factor.net/processes) -- it should be stateless and able to be replaced.Furthermore, a sane solution to mitigate this in the real world would suggest IP address throttling, at least to discourage DOS and force DDOS.In conclusion, it seems that you could have opened some of these issues with the sanic project, rather than write a reddit post first. In particular the memory limit seems more like a question than a problem, since that is configurable. Are you trying to inherently promote your own project as an alternative? Feel free to join the discussion here, if you're actually interested in sanic: https://github.com/channelcat/sanic/issues/1176#Issue #2 is completely unfounded.Sanic uses the TCP transport provided by the `uvloop` library.Sanic does not implement any flow control, because flow control is handled internally by uvloop.>Data is sent to a peer when the next data chunk is available. If TCP socket's Write Buffer is overloaded -- the data is pushed into process memory. If HTTP peer (browser or another client) consumes stream slower than Sanic produces it -- Sanic process will end up with out-of-memory eventually.This is false. Uvloop maintains a 65kb flow-control send buffer. If the buffer hits this limit, the tcp `write()` command _blocks_ the calling thread until the buffer is successfully sent. In this case, it is not possible for sanic to continue to produce streaming data if the client is consuming it slower than sanic is producing it. It will keep hitting the 65kb buffer limit and waiting for the client to catch up.Issues 1.a and 1.b can be mitigated by changing some default config values.By default `REQUEST_MAX_SIZE = 100000000 #100 megabytes` but it could be changed to `REQUEST_MAX_SIZE = 1000000 #1 megabyte` by the developer implementing sanic in their application.The 60 second timeout for delayed requests can be changed by configuring the `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` variable.By default `REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 60` but it can easily be changed to `REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 5` if the developer wishes.#How does this work with typical Flask or Django with Gunicorn on Nginx?#The main performance bottlenecks of a web app are almost always the network and database access. Improving back end performance by 0.1ms per request makes no sense when 70ms are spent accessing the database and when it takes 800ms to deliver a response. If you want a fast web website, optimize you front end and it's delivery and make sure your database queries are well crafted. #[I feel like this is very much](https://i.imgur.com/rF5pz8N.jpg) in the [spirit of the inspiration](https://i.imgur.com/RFJ9AJs.gif)#sanic is so fast that it handles 21 requests in [TechEmpower benchmark](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r15&hw=ph&test=plaintext)or maybe server responses so fast that client can not handle all responses :)#As an author of my own web framework, I am wondering what things would prevent this. My framework doesnt support streaming, so mostly I am curious about number 1. How would one prevent 1a from happening?From 1b point of view, I see that aiohttp has a 'client_max_size' setting, which prevents the 100MB body from happening, but you can take a .99MB request, and do the same thing, just with more connections. Same attack, just smaller body, more connections. How does one actually prevent 1b? The body is going to end up in memory regardless, right?How can I mitigate against these things? Do you have any suggestions?#I think these are pretty much intrinsic problems with async IO. You can probably mostly mitigate this with a load balancer to designed to deal with slow clients, but in general async is another name for cooperative multitasking and cooperative multitasking today has the same problems it did in the 90s: one badly written piece of code can block the thread and kill the system by mistake.#This is amazing just because of Sanic #And now ""Sanic security"" is touting itself as production ready despite the author [apparently lacking a basic understanding of security](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/qc1rh0/comment/hhe5cdc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Blind leading the blind on this project?#Why on Earth should anyone use some selfmade ""webserver"" if we have Nginx and Apache?#http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size for limiting client BODY size.Sorry, for response streaming there is no good solution now. Sleeps between `writer.write()` can help a little but there is no possibility to predict a sleep time.What really can help is setting high memory limit by worker runner (by systemd configuration for example https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html) and killing a worker with high memory footprint. Sounds ugly.Or just don't send big data and keep fingers crossed :)#\+ 1 to the nginx idea, this seems like something a reverse proxy would be good at filtering out in the meantime#Yes, I'm thhe leader of the aiohttp development team.The post is not about aiohttp/Sanic features comparison but Sanic problems.aiohttp mentioning appeared in comments, not in the post body.I am the **Python Core Developer** also.I was involved in `asyncio` creation from the very beginning, at times when the library was called `tulip`.Now Yuri Selivanov and I are the library maintainers, we work hard on `asyncio` bugs fixing and adding new features.Assuming this I can say that I have the very deep understanding of how asyncio-based code works, what pitfalls should be avoided etc.Returning to Sanic.Yes, early routing can help.Giving a chance to library user to decide if hi want to read request BODY or not, providing a way to read BODY chunk by chunk can help a lot.Adding a flow control to streaming responses (say, converting `streaming_response.write(data)` into a coroutine (`await resp.write(data)`) can eliminate the second security problem.Everything is possible, Sanic can fix own problems.But now the library is very insecure, it can run out-of-memory surprisingly easy.#It is already there for months: https://github.com/channelcat/sanic/issues/1067#What features are you missing?I'm curious what are most important/visible/handy Sanic features not supported by aiohttp?#Sanic collects a request body in a memory before calling a handler, this is a problem.You can pin down both max memory limit and handler execution timeout but now you can do it globally (on application level) only.By setting `request_max_size` to e.g. 16 KiB you solve the problem but disable big files uploading at the same time.> Are you trying to inherently promote your own project as an alternative?Sure no. The article has no ""aiohttp"" word at all.#>  If the buffer hits this limit, the tcp write() command blocks the calling thread until the buffer is successfully sent. Sorry, but it is not how asyncio (and uvloop) works.#WSGI runs a limited number of worker processes, say 30 per a node.BODY buffer size is controlled by frontend server, e.g. http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size for NGINX (1MB by default).1MB * 30 = 30 MB only.Sanic runs  *unlimited* amount of tasks, a task per incoming request. 1 MB * unlimited = out-of-memory.Regarding to file streaming -- in WSGI the streaming is done by `yield chunk`, control flow is controlled by WSGI application runner like gunicorn or uWSGI. Both systems suspend the execution until chunk is sent but Sanic doesn't suspend as described above in the article.#Basically, you should read from socket only when developer requests data. In sync world it is easy to do, but in async systems you need to spend much more time designing this interactions.aiohttp has two apis 1. Developer just ask to load whole body, that what is client max size  2. You use payload stream, and in this api you decide how much data you want to read from socket, aiohttp won’t read more than requestedp.s. I am one of the authors of aiohttp#You can just make a properly designed framework.For example, aiohttp has no such problems under the hood.#Please elaborate#Sanic is not a self-made ""webserver"" but a web framework like Django or Flask but asynchronous (like Tornado).#I'm not disputing the quality of your post or its accuracy. If Sanic is reading the entire body before routing that's a problem even without bad actors getting involved. It's just hard to see what hat you're wearing with this post: core dev, aiohttp maintainer, or someone who has seen all the sanic posts here and is concerned about the stability of the library. Or maybe it's all three.I don't think any of them are inappropriate view points, in fact the first two add more weight to your post. I guess my notion of wanting disclosure is coming from my own view point. I maintain libraries, that apparently other people use, and if I recommend them or post something critical of a competing library I disclose that I wrote and maintain X even though I doubt my name carries much, if any, recognition outside of small circles.I didn't mean to cause offense or detract from the conversation at hand. #That's only 2.5 months...not really that long...#Not really missing. But I feel the main draw of Sanic is its Flask like routing. Also believe it has something to similar to Flasks blueprints. People seem to love that setup. Really like aiohttp, we have two apps using it in production and third which never made it due to a client changing their minds.#Thanks for the replies, but how does this actually help? Isnt typicall behavior for the developer to just ask for the whole body right away anyways?#Maybe its completely coincidental but Sanic usually is a bastardization of Sonic the Hedgehog who goes fast.#Then why it's called ""python web server"" in the title? #Well, streaming responses were added to Sanic at 2017-05-05.Almost a year ago.Is it long enough?Or maybe the feature was not used in production for almost a year? I have no idea.#aiohttp has (optional) Flask style decorators now for routing :)#Well, you can not protect everyone. Developer needs to know what to do, framework just provides tools. Especially with large payloads, you have to be sure that you handle large amount of data right. It is developer responsibility. #It's deliberate  )#Thanks, that helps.#I thought so. It just makes stuff a bit more fun when you can talk about stuff like that."

I say write simple tests for simple features and move on. Save the effort for mission critical features. I’ve seen entire days wasted on tests for trivial things. Depending on your traction you need to keep moving. People obsess over total coverage of every piece of code.  I think that’s detrimental at startups. #Also... infrastructure. You don't need configuration management, server maintenance, complicated deploy mechanisms, and a custom databases to serve millions of requests a day. Just get on heroku.  When traffic increases, slide a couple bars to the right. ""Heroku is too expensive"" is a much better problem to have than ""we wasted 30% of our dev time on infra.""#While I don't disagree in general, I have purposefully done the opposite of item 1 in my new business and immediately after the MVP phase started to build out a microservices infrastructure.Three (counter?) points to make on that front:1) Yes, microservices from ground zero sucks.  It sucks a lot.  Security is complex.  Deployment, central configuration, and health-monitoring is complex.  My tech stack is - to me at least - ludicrous in the number of components I'm counting on and the effort to make them play nice together.  I've spent 6 weeks doing nothing profitable just trying to understand all the pieces and implement them to a reasonable level of functionality.2) For many startups that I see (I have an app/platform idea!) microservices are indeed overkill.  The view ain't worth the climb and the learning curve(s) associated are like tying big weights to your ankles before jumping in the pool.  The reality is that microservices architecture is - as of today - only justifiable if there is either huge traffic (which almost no startup has out of the gate) or huge complexity on the immediate horizon (like, during and right after MVP).  In the grand scheme of software/tech startups, most ideas are relatively simple so they do not meet either of the criteria.3) In my case, it may take years for the transaction volume alone to justify microservices, but the complexity and disparity of needs is a challenge right out of the gate, and it is only going to get more complex as time goes on.  Having built out these types of applications twice in the past (essentially a MES system with lots of automation) I have seen them very quickly become mired in their own monolithic or even SOA soup.  So, I decided to bite the bullet, take the pain up front so that we never get stuck or have our agility reduced by the complexity of integrating new needs / features / modules into our system.I feel like the hype of microservice architecture has created a counter-movement of nay-sayers who know they can accomplish most tasks the other way.  However, I also see LOTS of new tooling being built to support building things that way.  So, I'd encourage anyone considering choosing the microservices path to think long and hard about their investment, but don't write it off just because it's hard.#I went in on a small startupish project for a friend and they were adamant from the business side that every page of the site needed its own microservice.I think some folk can't help themselves when they encounter buzzwords and live in an enterprisey day job#> ""An average new business with a reliable financial forecast usually breaks even around three years.""Source?#To be fair, this post doesn't apply to all start ups. There are tons of new AI and deep learning start ups whose very life depends on data mining and big data. #Could someone explain this a little more in detail?#Tests protect you against regressions.  If you have no customers, by definition you can never have regressions.Also, in the early days of a product, regressions often create positive customer experiences if you have only a few customers and you're able to respond quickly with effective fixes.  Counter-intuitively in the early days regressions can cause 5-star reviews!Once you have hundreds of customers, killing regressions early with good tests becomes much more valuable to your business, but in the early days I think most tests are a total waste of time and actually hurt your business.#I think your right with your part that you shouldn't over do it with tests eq. 100% coverage is an overkill, but when you are developing properly with test driven development, your most of the time faster than when you would write no tests at all, and most of the time it is easier to test edge cases with unit or integration tests, because preparing the proper data to test it might be more complicated via the ui (depending on the case)#You write tests before writing code so that you know the code you wrote fulfills the contract. It's easier than being one of those people who do the ""oh shit it didn't work, let's throw some print statements everywhere"" type of testing.#This is soo much truth. Met some guy telling me about how he fine tuned his infrastructure and all this other crap on ECS..Asked him how much traffic he gets..like 2k a month lmaoo#Yep. Or something like hosted parse server is fine for startups. Easy setup, easy deployment. #This is why I love Docker for startup projects. You can spin up your own little cloud with a few services, attach a database, caching layer, networking, etc. and push it to any VPS. For the amount of traffic you’re likely to get at the start it’s more than adequate, and you can easily pull the components apart as microservices later.#Yep !Are there any good large scale open source projects deployed as micro services ? I have written micro services, but I feel like they are shitty. #I went with a microservice architecture for one of my startups for stability reasons. I was OK with my main API server or other components having problems and breaking, but one critical component could NOT be allowed to go down.By running the service completely separately from others I could ensure it was well-tested and stable, and I could save more time being a bit lax in testing other services. #Microservices is an architecture where you approach backend side of your product by creating lots of little applications that communicate with each other, rather than having one big application that handles everything.While there are big benefits of doing this in regards to being able to scale, maintain and have much-needed agility at a certain point, that point is too far off in the future for most of the new businesses.In practice working with microservices, especially without a crew with the necessary know-how, or ability to handle, monitor and manage complicated architectures means  complicated initial infrastructure, harder development, harder debugging, harder testing, harder exception handling, more regressions, complicated data consistency handling. Yes, your solutions to these problems, although hard and time-consuming, will stay with you. And if your project lives on long enough and gets bigger and bigger, you could start to see benefits of your initial investment. But that does not mean making this bet is a sensible one. Because it doesn't benefit you compared to alternatives even if it's a one you win. If you indeed succeed, it will be much easier to go down that road with the rich resources that you have at that point anyway. You'll probably do a much better job with the experience you get along the way, and you'll know your product better. That's the reason curbing your enthusiasm and waiting for the right moment for architectures as such is almost always a better idea.#Thank you for asking this question #I’ll give you an example of what I mean. I work at an ecommerce shop. We have a storefront (public facing) and a backoffice app for vendors. We have good volume  around $15-20k per day in revenue. The back office team was assigned a task to build a menu system that would be read from the store side. Basically a CMS feature.  It took them 2 weeks to deliver because they write tests for everything, including JavaScript. Only one person will ever use the menu admin. I don’t think this feature deserves 2 weeks of work and 100% test coverage. #As a non-developer who occasionally codes, your description of my testing method is so on-point.#Yeah. This. I wish I could test my software better. I do write a lot of tests, but I wish I could test more. There are some components I can't even test.

I implemented micro services with consul with a light weight burst of the monolithic application. Only in three sub apps. With the ability to burst feature clusters later.

But when they become devoid of common sense. It is not pretty.

I'm wondering if you guys can refute this.>FYI, OP: I work in 'Big Data' and you are vaaaaaastly overestimating the ability of Big Data to handle this problem. We aren't even within several orders of magnitude of being able to handle the calculation problem. This is not something that is rationally up for debate among reasonable people, it's just true.>Think about bread. Bread is basic and simple and should be really, really easy. How much bread do you make? Should be a simple task.>So how often do you post on facebook about bread? How often does anyone you know ever post on the internet or social media of any kind about bread? Basically never. We're flying blind. Ok, no problem. There are other ways to estimate beyond social media inputs! But what kind of bread... should we be making white or wheat bread? How thick should the slices be? Whole grain? Rye? How should it be baked? what about unleavened bread for the religious? Baguettes? Rolls? Potato Bread? Naan style bread? Pitas? How exactly do we calculate how much to produce of all these different things? There are hundreds of kinds of bread in that wikipedia list, and tens of thousands of types is probably more accurate when you look at all the sub varieties. How do you calculate all of that? How do you calculate the changes in taste as certain types of bread rise and fall in popularity? New preference observations need to be found every single week at minimum, and probably more often than that. Nobody's posting about it on social media certainly. Sales data takes far too long to aggregate and is far too incomplete to make meaningful decisions, from personal experience in the consumer data aggregation industry.>Furthermore, how do you decide which bread goes where? Which cities are bread-lovers and bread-haters? Which types of bread belong in which ratios in which cities? How is that broken down by neighborhood? Even furthermore, how do you price all of this? How can you possibly organize the logistics of it all from a central planning computer? How do you organize innovation? How do you make decisions about who should be producing it and where production should be located? How do you shift production among the thousands of types of bread when certain inputs have supply shocks (this year has a great rye and barley harvest, but a poor wheat harvest)?>This is literally impossible, and as I said above we aren't even within several orders of magnitude of being able to calculate 'bread'. Much less the entire economy of goods and services. We know how communist societies on a large scale actually deal with this - they have basically one kind of bread, and it's the same everywhere, and it's crappy quality, and there are frequent shortages/surpluses anyways because even something that simple is hard to calculate. And eventually they just change to a market-based approach, because markets are wonderful magic that do all this for us.;">I work in 'Big Data' and you are vaaaaaastly overestimating the ability of Big Data to handle this problem. We aren't even within several orders of magnitude of being able to handle the calculation problem. I have worked in Big Data, and this guy is full of shit, because he still doesn't understand the ECP. The ECP doesn't say ""computers can't simulate markets."" No fucking shit they can't. That's not the point.Mises originally formulated the ECP to argue that the only ""rational"" logic for an economy is a market based one, whereas socialist planners would have to fabricate stuff from scratch. **The ECP has literally nothing to do with whether the economy meets people's needs or wants**, given that, as we know, the market does a piss poor job of that anyways.With computational power, however, socialist planners can absolutely devise a rational non-market system for allocating production and goods.#He is absolutely correct that ""big data"" and ""AI"" are all too frequently trotted out as some magical panacea.However, he's completely overlooking one simple but important question: why can't consumers just *tell* the planner how much and which kinds of bread they demand?#We shouldn't speculate about the runtime of hypothetical algorithms, reality always ends up producing a different result. In this case, the best we can do is give an upper bound for a solution *at least as good* as the existing market-based solution. Currently, we are running a decentralized algorithm wherein actors independently negotiate exchange with one another. Available to this algorithm is the computing power present within the brain of every single person participating in the economy -- although as nobody is thinking about exchange *all the time*, only a fraction of this power is used. Let every brain add a constant (astronomical) number of resources *B*, and let the number of humans be *n*. To perfectly simulate the market, we therefore need *O(nB)* resources. It is trivial to see that a simulation of the market can perform at least as well as the market itself, when given similar computational resources -- just perform the exact same computations. This is, in fact, the [Lange-Lerner-model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lange_model). Whether or not this model can perform *better* than the market depends on the ability of the planners to use lookahead in constant time -- if the ""next steps"" can be predicted with greater-than-chance confidence, improved outcomes can be achieved such as e.g. the elimination of X-inefficiency. Nevertheless, regardless of the ability to perform lookahead, this solution will be *at least as good* as the market.Thus, a computational solution superior to the market will be available *if* (but not *only if* -- this inference we cannot make):1. We have access to mass-production of a machine with computational power equal to or greater than *B*, the amount of resources the average brain spends thinking about market exchanges.2. We have the capacity to produce and available energy to run one of these machines for every human being in existence.In other words, if we can give every single person on the planet a personal computer, we are only a couple of iterations of Moore's Law ahead. If we cannot use massive parallelism for scale in this way, we must wait for further breakthroughs in software (and trust me, plenty of computer scientists are working on related subjects).> This is literally impossibleConjecture, and not even all that reasonable conjecture -- Amazon is getting fairly close to a centralized system to stocking goods for 24-hour delivery, which makes it at least *reasonable* to think that software solution with runtime independent of *n* exists, even if we haven't invented it yet.#Before I accept that computers cannot solve the economic calculation problem, you're going to have to explain why the economic calculation problem is a problem.  What is it that I'm supposed to have difficulty calculating here?#Is everyone ignoring the Chilean experimentation with computation and AI in the 70s, and how it actually saved the transfer of goods to the places that needed them when a strike took out most of the distribution trucks? No?Cybersyn is a thing. And that was in the 70s.#The economic calculation problem isn't about having enough computational power to rise to some arbitrary level of efficient planning--it's about *always having less power by definition* than the market.#Does the capitalist free market really know better? I've worked at a supermarket, I've seen the bread that is wasted off unsold and also the days when bread is in such short supply that whining customers accused me of hoarding it for myself.What do you think a market is? Magic? I swear, you people talk of the market as though it was God. A thing that sees all and knows all. Let me tell you the story of Cybersyn: a national computer network set up in Allende's socialist Chile to enable building a society of 'Red Plenty' where everyone could live a life of great standards.One day, the entire logistics network of Chile was shut down by a strike backed by American interests. 40,000 drivers were not working. 3000 replacement workers were assigned to the appropriate duties by Cybersyn and it kept Chile functioning close to normally. This is what 1970s computer technology could do: better than the anarchic mess of the market.How can that be applied to production tasks? Well, two Scottish Marxists, Cottril and Cockshott, wrote a book on this: ""Towards a New Socialism."" It outlines how a typical desktop computer of 1990 could plan an entire economy of a million inputs and outputs. Since 1990, computing power has increased dramatically. We won't have any problems relying on modern computers to plan an economy.#Thought #1:  I am contemplating a Master's Degree, basically in ""Big Data"".  The process has had me reading material about what techniques like artificial intelligence and machine learning are being used for.  *I'm not going to refute this.  I'm going to agree with this.  The writer is dead-on, in the view from my desk.*Thought #2.  The problem with the 'Economic Calculation Problem' is how the errors impact society.  In a closed society, they are over-simplified.  Which means that the production of a society never actually gets the opportunity to get feedback on a limitless number of potential changes, new features, or creative permutations of a products.  If all you are doing is relying on The Machine, then you won't even have a choice of Creamy v. Crunchy, and your society will never even get close to considering Almond Butter, 'peanuts and salt only', or Nutella.Thought #3.  The other problem is that errors are *borne* by society.  One of those ways is lack of product diversity, from #2.  But if a product is predicted, but doesn't end up really working well, then the loss is borne by society.  The resources that built that factory that produced 'the bad thing' actually took away from resources which could have been used for other things.  In a private property and free market system, losses don't 'bleed out' to the rest of society, they are basically self-contained to the owners.#>no one but me understands the ECP - and here is the gospel definition in a pedantic little box.u/specterofsandersism /threadFor the rest of us, we should ignore this dolt.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTTyzl6taKk#I have a professional certificate in data mining and I can tell you this guy doesn't do a good job of classifications error if he thinks these questions:>How thick should the slices be?are ""good questions"".

Magic as in ""not real life"".#Hayek's knowledge problem ***is not the same*** as Mises' economic calculation problem, no computer or amount of computer processing power would ever be capable of solving the ECP, as there would be a specific type of information missing without the market system. The socialist planners could never rationally determine what to produce, where, when, at which quantity, with which inputs, without market prices, because they wouldn't know the costs of producing all this stuff.Here's the most relevant parts of an [article by economist Robert Murphy](https://mises.org/wire/socialism-calculation-problem-not-knowledge-problem-0) about the subject:>Even so, all of the problems of dispersed knowledge, tacit knowledge, and how prices are an efficient mechanism for communication of information—none of that is the fundamental flaw Mises attributed to socialism. From the beginning, when Mises would walk through his critique, he would stipulate at the outset that the central planner in a socialist regime had not only good intentions, but also all of the relevant technical knowledge at his disposal. Now to be sure, in the real world these problems do exist: A socialist dictator might be ruthless with his opponents, and (as Hayek stressed) he couldn’t possibly get all of the “facts on the ground” from experts around the country, jammed into his mind in order to make good decisions.>Yet even though these problems are enormous in the real world, nonetheless, for the sake of argument, Mises assumed away the problem of evil and the problem of dispersed knowledge. Yet it would still be the case, Mises claimed, that the socialist planner would be groping in the dark. Even after the fact, the planner would have no way of assessing whether the scarce resources—natural resources, capital goods, and labor—at his disposal were being deployed in the best manner. The socialist planner would have no way of measuring the economic efficiency of his plan for the of society’s resources.>Mises didn’t argue that the socialist planners wouldn’t be able to process information in real-time. No, Mises kept stressing that there would be a categorical absence of a special type of information (if we want to use that word) that could only be produced amidst market institutions.>Indeed, in Notes and Recollections Mises refers to these economists pushing the mathematical solution and writes, “They failed to see the very first challenge: How can economic action that always consists of preferring and setting aside, that is, of making unequal valuations, be transformed into equal valuations, and the use of equations?”>Mises not only identifies the crucial flaw with socialism, but he also explains how a market economy solves the problem. Specifically, the institution of private property and the use of a common medium of exchange, allow for the generation of genuine market prices for all of the goods and services available. Entrepreneurs are then able to engage in monetary calculation, to embark on projects that they think will be profitable and avoid those that will suffer losses. This market process is what allows a capitalist system to efficiently allocate resources, whereas a socialist system cannot—not even “in principle.”>Let me try to motivate the point this way: When we use a thermometer to measure the temperature inside an oven in a commercial bakery, the device transmits information to us. There really is an objective “fact of the matter” of the kinetic energy of the air molecules bouncing around inside the oven, and the thermometer is an imperfect way of translating that data to us, in a form our minds can comprehend and incorporate into our decisions. But there’s no doubt that the oven really has a temperature, regardless of our measuring it with a thermometer.>In contrast, when we ask, “How much economic value does the oven possess?” then that is a fundamentally different question. This isn’t an objective fact that is embedded in the arrangement of matter. The question takes into account all of the subjective preferences of everyone on the planet, as well as their expectations about the possibility of transforming matter into different forms. It is a mind-boggling question, in fact, that can only be answered by setting up a market economy and then making informed guesses as to what people would be willing to pay for the oven.#>However, he's completely overlooking one simple but important question: why can't consumers just tell the planner how much and which kinds of bread they demand?That is effectively what they are doing now - with money.

In this model, the state owns non-labor factors of production, and markets allocate final goods and consumer goods. The Lange model states that if all production is performed by a public body such as the state, and there is a functioning price mechanism, this economy will be Pareto-efficient, like a hypothetical market economy under perfect competition. Unlike models of capitalism, the Lange model is based on direct allocation, by directing enterprise managers to set price equal to marginal cost in order to achieve Pareto efficiency.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28#The ECP is so frequently misunderstood on this subreddit. It's not at all about the difficulty of calculating prices via a computer.#The end goal of Marxism is a classless, equal, moneyless society is it not?To get to this, Marxism (and most forms of Socialism) require 1. For workers to own the means of production2. Some form of central planning that manages resource allocation, sets quotas/goals, lays the foundation of guidelines 2 is why the Economic Calculation Problem exists. The general critique is based on what we see happen in economies today, and from what has historically happened in the past. In essence, the ECP states that without private control of capital, the profit motive, money, and the absence of quotas/price controls, a centrally planned economy lacks microeconomic oversight due to the inability to micromanage supply and price because there aren't any clear price indicators.In a market economy, firms in competition balance their costs and supply chain and set prices to allign with equilibrium based on the price signalling of other firms. Due to every firm having clearly defined prices and costs, supply and demand meet in places where there aren't major shortages or surpluses.On the flip side, in a centrally planned economy where prices are either fixed or quotas are placed on goods without any type of currency, the central planner must ""calculate"" how every single good, service, resource is allocated, how much should be produced, what type, etc. Without price signals, how would the central planner know how much input costs are, the appropriate amount to produce, and the appropriate amount to allocate, and how many people are expected to consume the good/service?Essentially, in a market economy everything is micromanaged and easily calculated due to prices being a great indicator of what is happening in the economy, whereas a centrally planned economy lacks the sheer amount of individual oversight and data of how valuable things are. When Venezuela and the USSR fixed the prices of food,  resource supply and demand didn't meet at equilibrium and grocery stores were almost completely empty. When Chinese farmers had to meet production quotas, they barely had enough food to feed themselves, and lacked the ability to figuratively 'raise prices' to compensate for the high demand and continue producing or allow for the quantity sent away to be decreased. Some people think that with advanced A.I and computational power, the economic calculation problem can be ""solved"" by being able to better calculate the efficient amount of things that need to be produced at all levels. #> What is it that I'm supposed to have difficulty calculating here?The same things the market is calculating, i.e. what things should go to whom based on demand forecasting etc. The problem is that you, the central planner, have computational power many orders of magnitude smaller than that of the market, thus no rational basis for price formation.#The post goes over this.

And while I haven’t read the book you are referencing, though it sounds quite interesting, the argument put forward in the referenced text is that the number of “inputs”, or data points to be more accurate, is magnatudes higher than a million. I haven’t seen hard evidence either way in terms of bread, but my personal experience in the software/data science world leads me to side with him.Plus I imagine your book is making some assumptions about the acquisition, cleaning, storage and transmission of data that are... optimistic.Plus if 3000 workers were all that were needed, why were there 40,000 to begin with?#I think you are missing the point when addressing some of these questions:>>How exactly do we calculate how much to produce of all these different things?>lbs of grain available, lbs of firewood, and oven cooking surface area.Okay, but how do we allocate grain between bread and pastries?

The same is the principle behind the Lange model, which was shown in theory to do *the same* as the hypothetical free market (in terms of Pareto efficiency), but doesn't rely on the assumption that markets will always exert a pressure on firms to price at marginal cost.Of course, if you reject neoclassical thought and believe the wage rate (or rate of profit) to be exogeneous to the economic model, there's a bigger case to be made: such planning could, in theory, be used to deal with the allocation of surplus product in a way which isn't pressured one way or the other by social power.>What if I'm a somewhat mischievous user who says 'give me 1,000 loafs of exotic bread' - how do you separate that user out (ignore the request) from the user who is say... planning a wedding and has legitimate need of 1000 exotic loafs?The system would have to be dominant strategy truthful, which typically translates roughly into some form of ""being ready to put your money where your mouth is"", so that people don't have an incentive to lie.

Dickinson (1933), who claimed that Mises was wrong, that rational calculation under socialism was at least theoretically possible. Because any economy could be formally represented by a Walrasian system of equations, Dickinson claimed that on a theoretical level there is no difference between capitalism and socialism: In a capitalist system the equations are “solved” by the market, whereas in a socialist system they could be solved by the planning authorities.>In his rebuttal, Hayek enumerated many difficulties associated with “the mathematical solution,” or any regime that relied on formulating and solving a giant system of equations for the relevant prices and quantities. He mentioned the staggering amount of information that would need to be gathered  the immense difficulty of for- mulating the correct system of equa- tions  the hundreds of thousands of equations that would then need to be solved, not just once but repeatedly  and the inability of such a system to adapt to change.- Hayek and Socialism, Bruce Caldwell#> The end goal of Marxism is a classless, equal, moneyless society is it not?No.  ""Marxism"" isn't some blueprint to define goals.

This is achieved through redistribution, nationalization of resources etc. and to varying extents. In some cases this can work well, like in an emergency situation mentioned above. Other times markets outperform. In this sense, socialism and decentralization are mutually exclusive.Now, say we are going to delegate these ""issues of the society"" to local areas, in some ways decentralizing the system. Well, then we lose the advantages of the system. Poortown now has to provide for its citizens without the resources previously redistributed from Moneyport.

I'm just still not convinced a computer system could be developed to outperform the status quo.

The USSR outperformed capitalism by numerous metrics that are simply more important to me then how many jeans a nation produces: homelessness, unemployment, healthcare, etc. And that was with computers less powerful than your average smartphone. Remember, provided they are honest (such as u/HeFlipYa) capitalist apologists will freely admit that the market doesn't have as its main priority meeting people's needs and wants. In fact, HFY will argue that's irrelevant because you can't measure needs and wants.So there's the fundamental confusion: people who hear ECP, don't actually read Mises' paper, and think the ECP states that socialism can't meet needs and wants as effectively as market. No. Mises didn't give a flying fuck about that. He would be perfectly ok with any level of homelessness or starvation or diabetics dying for want of insuling, so long as the market prescribed it, and in fact I would agree that such a system is ""rational"" in the sense of ""having and following rules."" Perhaps in Mises' day, there wasn't a feasible set of alternate rules. Today, alternate rule sets are feasible, and before you go asking ""is it as efficient as capitalism?"" keep in mind that the ECP isn't even about efficiency, and also that efficiency has to be operationalized with respect to a concrete variable.

Mises *knew* this though. That's why (at least in his formulation of the ECP) he didn't argue that. Rather, he argued, currently, that the sum total of such microeconomic transactions is a ""rational"" (rule-based) basis for an economy, and further that there was no alternative. Since there was no alternative, whether the market actually took into account everyone's preferences or not didn't matter at all. In 1920, that may have been true. It isn't any longer.

Does it scale past a small enclave? etc. And most importantly, this question is not answered in the absolute, but only relative to real alternatives that are available right now.But there are a priori reasons to think profitability is a good proxy for economic value as well. Assuming that people's wants are the measure of economic value, when a thing is profitable it means that someone is both willing and able to pay for it. And in a market economy where the main way of getting purchasing power is to provide value to others (value in the commonly held, i.e. non-LTV sense), the ""someone"" for whom the profitable thing is intended is an actually productive member of society. And the wants/needs of the productive must come before those of the unproductive. I know the socialist takes issue with this by denying that purchasing power is tied to value (thus productivity) in a market economy, but that's only true if you change the definition of ""value"" to be something that doesn't answer to what normal people mean by that word.> If people aren't cooperating (but competing), what prevents me from making another Y at the same time someone else is making another Y and having us overproduce Y while no one produces another X cause everyone wants to produce Y cause it has higher profit margins? What prevents that is forecasting, the value of which is by definition excluded from LTV (since it has no SNLT). Which is just one reason why there has never been a society whose mode of production looks anything like what socialists want. Moreover, what prevents (or at least, corrects for) it is the tendency of the rate of profit to fall over time. Rather than being some sort of death knell of capitalism as the Marxist seems to think, this tendency actually provides it with a large measure of internal stability and adaptability.#Because the market gives more freedom.Also,>giving people the freedom to produce what they want and in whatever proportions they likeIdeological nonsense void of any content.

If so, how are you correlating rate of profit to human wants/desires?> In fact, if we were to follow your logic further, we might be able to deduce that price is determined by two different forces.I'm not talking about price.  I'm talking about rate of profit.  Producing something that $500 doesn't tell me anything about whether or not I should invest in such production (as a capitalist, which I am).  If I have to invest $499 in order to produce one of those $500 things, that's shit.I understand how increased demand can affect price.  I don't care about price because price alone cannot in any way shape or form tell me where to invest my capital. I'm concerned about rate of profit.  That is going to determine where my capital is invested, that is going to determine how much is produce vs. how little.> One being correlated to how much people want a product, and the other in how much product a supplier can make. Perhaps we can call those two things ""demand"" and ""supply"" respectively.What prevents two companies from duplicating efforts?  For example, let's say the rate of profit of Y rises above X, and I take this to indicate that people want more Y, and I'm incentivized to produce it instead of X because of its higher rate of profit.  Since I'm not cooperating with other businesses, what prevents others from doing the same thing, and then having an overproduction of Y and an underproduction of X with respect to people's wants/needs?#>I didn't ask about the price. I asked about the rate of profit.Yes, the rate of profit would increase, as I'd imagine their costs remain the same.>OK, can you graph this? Is it linear, exponential, logarithmic, can it be any of these depending on other things? If so, how are you correlating rate of profit to human wants/desires?Depends on demand vs. price and supply vs. price, but if you have that information you know the equilibrium price and the quantity demanded and supplied, then the profit rate would be commodity price minus supply costs.>What prevents two companies from duplicating efforts? Nothing, which is a good thing. Competition in a market is good for everyone except the capital owner. And it's unprofitable to overproduce Y and underproduce X, so the market discourages it. #> I'd imagine their costs remain the same.Why would their costs remain the same?  If people want more of X and X requires Y to produce, then isn't Y also more demanded and therefore more expensive?  It's still not clear how rate of profit is correlating to need/want.  You kept using the word ""price"" -- which based on supply/demand I could see correlating more towards needs/want, but why would a capitalist invest in production of more of something simply because its price want up (or less because it went down)?  How does _rate of profit_ correlate to demand/want?  I ask this because it seems to me that rate of profit is the incentive for the capitalists.So if we're going to address the ""efficiency"" of capitalist resource allocation with respect to solving the ""ECP"" -- it seems to me that price is rather meaningless on it's own, because we don't know what cost of production or rate of profit is.> ...then the profit rate would be commodity price minus supply costs...Gee thanks.> And it's unprofitable to overproduce Y and underproduce X, so the market discourages it.How do you know you're overproducing Y with respect to the market if you're not cooperating with other producers of Y?  If there are 10,000 people that want Y, and company A plans to produce 8,000 to capitalize on that market and company B plans to produce 9,500, then you've overproduced by 7500 units.  How can a capitalist know this without knowing what their competition is doing?It may be unprofitable in the long term, but how do you know this ahead of time in a competitive market? Obviously if together both companies produce 17,500 units, there's going to be a lot of extra.  Now maybe that oversupply causes the price to fall, which now means your actual rate of profit is less than your projected rate of profit, and maybe if the price falls you sell a few thousand more units, but not all of them.OK, now you know not to produce more -- but you've already overproduced here, and those resources could have been better allocated to producing something else.What prevents this from occurring repeatedly, over and over, in different markets as capitalists migrate and invest in various prices chasing higher and higher profits?#>I ask this because it seems to me that rate of profit is the incentive for the capitalists.You'd be wrong. Absolute profit is. A rational business owner would rather sell 500 units with a profit margin of 20% than 100 units with a profit margin of 50%. Better profit margins are always great, but often not attainable, and yet low profit margin businesses continue to operate.>Gee thanks.np>How do you know you're overproducing Y with respect to the market if you're not cooperating with other producers of Y?The price system. Which is the essential part of the economic calculation problem that we're talking about. >It may be unprofitable in the long term, but how do you know this ahead of time in a competitive market? Obviously if together both companies produce 17,500 units, there's going to be a lot of extra. Now maybe that oversupply causes the price to fall, which now means your actual rate of profit is less than your projected rate of profit, and maybe if the price falls you sell a few thousand more units, but not all of them.Your analysis is less than rigorous, but it does hint at an important real-world phenomenon. This phenomenon is the effect of competition in the market. In a monopolized market, the capital owner makes huge profits at the expense of consumers and workers alike. When competition is introduced above a certain amount where cartelization is possible, profit rates fall, consumer surplus increases, and wages rise. So your fantasy scenario of ""overproduction"" is real, but it's a good thing.  One caveat, though, is when production has social costs which aren't well accounted for in the market like environmental degredation. These problems require government intervention.#> Absolute profit is. A rational business owner would rather sell 500 units with a profit margin of 20% than 100 units with a profit margin of 50%.Perhaps a rational business owner with unlimited funds/credit would.  This is why Marx proposes the differences he does between competitive capitalism and monopoly capitalism.  Unfortunately, in the real world, what I am actually looking for is the greatest mass of profit **relative** to how much I can invest.  Stated another way, the highest rate of profit.But you knew that, cause your economic analysis is not idealized garbage, but actually constrained by material reality like Marx's.> The price system. Which is the essential part of the economic calculation problem that we're talking about. But prices only change in response to oversupply with respect to demand.  You've already over produced.> Your analysis is less than rigorous...Says the person who believes people have infinite amounts of capital to invest and therefore seek out the highest mass of profit, period as opposed to the highest mass of profit relative to their investment.#>Stated another way, the highest rate of profit.Oh, ROI. Yeah, I suppose that's true. But as I said, businesses still operate in low profit margin industries and it is a good thing.>But prices only change in response to oversupply with respect to demand. You've already over produced.No, they vary continuously. >Says the person who believes people have infinite amounts of capital to invest and therefore seek out the highest mass of profit, period as opposed to the highest mass of profit relative to their investment.I think there's some confusion about the terms we're using. When I said ""A rational business owner would rather sell 500 units with a profit margin of 20% than 100 units with a profit margin of 50%"", I'd intended that capital amortization would be included in that. Nevertheless, you're correct that business owners seek the highest return on investment. What relevance does this have?#> No, they vary continuously.You're going to have to explain ""continuously.""  As this is not my experience as a consumer or as someone who has worked in multiple industries.  For example, when I worked in a company that did manufacturing, the prices were relatively fixed, but after awhile if we overproduced by 10,000 units we'd severely discount them and sell to stores that carried lots of overstock products.  There was no ""continuous"" feedback mechanism as you seem to suggest.Can you give an example of where this continuous feedback mechanism takes place in the real world and where it prevents overproduction **before** it happens?> What relevance does this have?Migration of capital into certain production endeavors to increase or decrease available saleable product supply is pretty critical to the question of resource allocation in capitalism.  Isn't the whole point of the ECP to say that socialism is incapable of allocating resources as efficiently as a capitalist system because it lacks prices with any market basis?It seems like a logical starting point for determining whether or not that's true is to determine how and in what ways capitalism actually allocates its resources.  Only by doing that would it seem we'd be able to identify whether or not there are problems and whether or not an alternative system would solve or exacerbate those problems.Thus far, I feel that one problem that capitalism faces in resource allocation is that by creating a competitive market, varying capital interests which do not cooperate can invest in the same markets simultaneously trying to capitalize on the opportunity.  In doing so, this seems like it would not only lead to overproduction of certain consumer goods, but perhaps even the allocations of existing tools, factory space, raw materials, etc into places where they're basically duplicating efforts.In a socialist society where producers freely associate and coordinate their production together using a system of information sharing and social book keeping, it would be much easier to identify rates of consumption across entire populations and respond accordingly since all the information would be shared.  So it would be far easier and faster to identify where resources which could be used for other things are and how they could be allocated.#Oh, I see what you're saying.  I cede the point. Markets are not 100% efficient. I maintain that they're pretty good though. Could you describe in detail how a socialist society would produce more efficiently? I believe it'd be a difficult endeavor."

It's bulky and not super lucrative, compared to heroin or coke, but by continuously moving it it gives them the funds they need to send the riskier shipments of harder, more lucrative drugs. I don't know that cannabis legality would kill the cartels but they'd certainly take a hit. I also think people would be likely to get wrapped up in other drugs if cannabis was available. People would be able to get cannabis and wouldn't find themselves slowly embroiled with the sort of people who also have coke or heroin. People could escape the underground that provides something as innocuous as marijuana but also more harmful drugs.#You're completely lying and you should be ashamed of yourself. You're being evil.

It's not like we still have gang violence over rum runners competing for black market alcohol sales. Ending prohibition shut down the black market surrounding the banned substance. #Yes it counts for a little over a third of their revenue but the cartels do much more than just sling drugs.

To let you know I'm in favor of legalizing weed but we have to think rationally on how huge these cartels are at the moment. #I'm having a little hard time understanding what your saying but is it that Cannabis leads to more drugs due to the culture of having to deal with dealers that push other drugsBut I agree it allows them to have a good base to deal with harder drugs #> ...by continuously moving it it gives them the funds they need to send the riskier shipments of harder, more lucrative drugs. I don't know that cannabis legality would kill the cartels but they'd certainly take a hit.This is why the ACTUAL solution is to decriminalize ALL drugs and to stop locking up and enslaving people with drug addictions/habits.

The salient point for me was the contention that there is a huge economy of scale to big data collection.  Facebook and Google are getting better and better at it, which means newer firms are going to struggle to enter the marketplace.  Longer term, this could lead to virtual monopolies in tech.  Worse than how it already is.  One proposed solution was to change how data is treated.  Instead of making it proprietary to each individual company, open it up like a utility.  For example, Facebook would have to sell access to its data to new firms.  As users, our relationship to tech firms and how we provide data will also have to change.  Ownership of the data should be switched from the tech companies to us as individuals.  These data have serious financial benefit, not to mention the privacy consequences, and they're being sold and used without clear notifications. I don't pretend to know what the answer is.  Maybe put personal data on a blockchain?  Private keys would allow consumers to provide data to tech firms and would allow consumers to shut off the tap when necessary.

Are the job responsibilities too vague?2. What type of data scientists should we be looking for? Would hiring a PhD candidate make a huge difference? Or would candidates with less experience but more passion for the cryptoassets industry be a viable option?3. Obviously, candidates would need to have experience with financial valuation models, but we also want them to be flexible in finding interesting bits of data, whether anomalies in valuations or correlations between price and other data that we're collecting (social media presence, number of followers, number of active developers and git commits), sentiment analysis, etc.). Is this too much to ask for? From my understanding, data scientists are often experienced in one or a couple of specialties (Statistician / Mathematician / Machine Learning Scientists / Actuarial Scientist). Please correct me if I'm wrong.4. Are data scientists who we should be even looking for? If so, what type of experience should I be looking for in their resumes for the duties that are laid out in the job listing? Thanks in advance. Your inputs will be greatly appreciated. And feel free to PM me if you think you'd be a perfect fit for us and we can talk more (hope this isn't breaking any subreddit rules). P.S. There should be a hiring guide for companies (especially startups without a CDO yet) looking for Data Scientists  )";"A few observations:If you want your Senior Data Scientist to stick around, make sure you can honestly answer the question of how much of his or her time will be spent collecting and cleaning data and how much on analysis. There's always some of both but if you're trying to recruit a scalpel for chopping potatoes you're both going to get frustrated.The most effective and actionable insights from data science typically come from looking inward at how the business itself reacts to a changing business environment. Research shops sometimes have difficulty doing this. Think very carefully about how your Senior Data Scientist will work with your other teams. If you expect him or her to handle change management and soft skills make sure that's clear up front because that's not usually part of a PhD program. If you don't expect this individual to manage this, make sure you can tell candidates what kind of plan or support you have for this.When I go to a Data Science job interview the one question I tend to ask of the management is ""What will you do when I produce a report that shows the business is wrong about something you are very confident in?""Make sure you can answer this question honestly and in a way that shows you are prepared to exercise evidence-based decision making.#As someone with a PhD, and many years of experience in academia, industry (including finance) and consulting for both plus government, I would not apply for this job. Turn offs include:> ""think outside the box""Don't put that unless your listing thought outside the box too. It's the most generic expression for ""we want creative people but we're not creative and don't know what creativity is""> ""You will be assisting our Data Science Intern in the projects that he is assigned""Assisting the intern sounds like *assistant to the intern*, if you want a leader, don't phrase things in a way that they are underneath those at the bottom of the ladder. Rephrase that to say ""lead a team"" or ""mentor""> Does this excite you? I hope it doesI have no interest in the personal hopes of the HR person or other company employee who wrote this. If it's exciting, give plain reasons why. Don't be some half-assed unconfident cryptocurrency wannabe. If it's exciting, it should have been clear already.> Salary: will range from $85,000 to $140,000 DOEIf it has ""Senior"" in the title, except if it's in the boonies where cost of living is cheap, start at 6 figures. I know you're a startup so you're cheap, but if $85000 is what you can afford, just call it ""data scientist""> Cover letterI never bother with those unless I know the company/job I will apply for is worth it. That's been exceedingly rare lately. And the companies that are worth it usually have rather open-ended requirements because they know what they are doing, have many roles to fill, and understand many skills are transferable/adaptable/learnable for someone with experience#You're not looking for a data scientist, you're looking for a quant.#You might be significantly under market salary for anyone who can truly be successful in the role based on these requirements/business problems laid out. You may be better suited to look for a Financial Engineer (Data Scientist in the finance world) as the more typical DS candidates will not usually possess the finance knowledge you desire. Good luck. #I think the title/requirements don't fully align with the job description and what you want to achieve. It sounds like you have some data assets and want to to leverage them but aren't entirely sure what should be done. In that regard, you are looking for a person who can decide what should be done as much as actually be able to do it.If the above is correct, consider hiring as much for personality as for skills. It sounds like you are looking for someone who is comfortable with ambiguity and can manage iterative bets until he stumbles on something good. This is something that (I think) Ph.Ds should be comfortable with, but you can find those traits in other places as well. Notably, what I think you are looking for at this point aren't so much the quantitative skills that a traditional Ph.D. data scientist has. You mentioned someone straight out of bootcamp who was very enthusiastic. I'd consider him/her. It sounds like a good chance at personality match for the job, and while they will be capped with respect to the ""scientific sophistication"" they bring to the table, it's not at all clear that that is what you need. Said differently, data science is not magic, and you can't bring in a data science and expect profit to appear in a place no one was looking. You're looking for someone to whom you can say ""here is a bunch of data go find treasure"" whereas you're currently for hiring for someone in the ""The treasure is here. Go extract it"" spirit. #hire anyone who has a titanic kernel on kaggle#Depending on where you are located, I expect that salary range might be a challenge. An experienced candidate with the experience you seek is probably already at the top of your range.#If you have the budget for it, you can hire consultants to help you find the right candidate. At an old company, we tried finding a data scientist ourselves with no idea what we were doing and had an awful experience. We finally hired a consultant to help and found an excellent employee.#I don't know if you're guilty of this or not, but I'll post in case I can help guide your reasoning. I'm between jobs as a data scientist, and in looking for jobs I have come across a number of job postings seeking a ""data scientist"" but with domain-specific experience. Data science requires a solid mathematics/statistics and programming background. To have expertise in all the businesses that can now utilize data science is somewhat ridiculous, assuming you want someone who really is well-versed in the math/programming the role requires. On the other hand, if you want someone with a finance degree who can maybe code and can handle financial math (but perhaps not linear algebra, signal processing, or other fields in applied math/statistics), you're gonna have a bad time when the neural net they've cobbled together from a library is overfitted or having numerical issues. Basically, if you hire a STEM grad, your data scientist is the black box, and you can train them on enough finance to get by. If you hire a finance wonk, their tools might become the black box, and nobody will ever know when those tools aren't doing what there supposed to, much less fix it.Fact is, most models will return all kinds of crazy results from time to time, flukes in the data or how it was presented to the machine, because the machine generally doesn't know the basics of finance, it's trained to find patterns in the data. Your data scientist needs to know enough to see when the machine is missing basics of finance, and when the machine itself is broken. In my opinion, it's easier to get worthy insights from a machine that is definitely working than trusting one that might be broken.Also, there's something to be said about confirmation bias in terms of experience. If you have someone who's well-versed in the dogma of finance, they may (consciously or not) filter out results that are real-world disruptive, but also contradict longstanding practices and widely held beliefs. You want disruptive, talk to someone who has no idea. Teach them the absolutes (lending money at a negative interest rate is ludicrous) and the basics, but beyond that, let them find what they find. But this is just my opinion, and as one of those STEM guys, I probably am biased. I've worked places where they'd happily futz with the data until it backed their preconceived notions (the phrase ""decision support"" came up a lot), I'd rather not see these practices in yet more fields. But it's your call.#[deleted]#""You will lay out the groundwork for creating metrics and valuation models for cryptoassets for the inevitable time when the crypto market is no longer a speculative market.""It's always going to be a speculative market. These 'coins' don't produce anything like bonds or stocks do. They just sit there doing fuck all like gold. There's nothing to value. You don't need a data scientist. You need someone who questions things and isn't afraid to challenge the foundation of what you're trying to do. #We've received over 100 applicants in the past week, but almost all of them seem to be Data Scientists that are sending out resumes everywhere and anywhere without even looking at the job description, which makes it even harder for us. For example, we've received a resume from a very experienced candidate with his resume packed... but it had no personal touch, just a standard ""I think I would be a good fit"" with a list of his past experiences.On the other hand, one application we've received was from someone straight out of boot camp, and we could tell he is not only enthusiast about what we're trying to accomplish, but even gave us some great ideas that we have not thought of. This puts me in a difficult spot -- go for the experienced (more expensive) applicants? Or give these fresh-out-of-college/bootcamp candidates that are legitimately interested in thinking outside the box and hungry to learn a chance to prove their skills in an entry-level Jr. role?Any thoughts?#/r/algotrading#Why not hire 2-4 more regular data scientists for that pay? create jobs, help the economy, get 2-4 times as much mental input. Help non senior data scientists get enough experience to be senior data scientists. If u don't know what your looking for why hate on junior data scientists?#1. I think the job responsibilities are pretty clear, except maybe some language on how much data engineering is going to be needed - I've found that sometimes data scientists can be prima donnas about doing their own data engineering.2 + 3. If you interview PhD candidates make sure you ask them why they're choosing this instead of a job in academia. There should be no assumptions that working in industry is easier than academia - in fact, it can often be harder because you're dealing with real people, unfortunately. That being said, there's a rich history of PhD ""quants"" in the finance world so I think you will attract many of those. I think it'll be either quants or actuaries that you would want to find - they come the closest to describing what you need.4. These days, for a senior i would start the bidding at 3 yrs of actual experience as a data scientist - not including data analyst type roles, bootcamps, or internships, unless they have direct relevant experience in finance at a well known institution. Then you can give them some leeway, but make sure they know fundamentals of crypto currency.#Thank you for the insight, very appreciated. We (CTO and CFO) plan on collecting and cleaning data as much as possible so that the hire can focus on fun, potentially disruptive ideas in this new class of assets. As for this:>""What will you do when I produce a report that shows the business is wrong about something you are very confident in?""We will be conducting research on the cryptoasset markets, not necessarily inwardly into our company operations. But of course, if he believes that we are conducting market research in an ineffective manner, we would fully stand by his side--he is the professional after all.#This comment has great feedback. Also be prepared to raise your salary.#> but if $85000 is what you can afford, just call it ""data scientist""> I would go further down and call it ""junior data scientist"" or ""analyst"" especially if you are going to report to an intern. Seriously they are looking for an experienced quant at the level any big place like two-sigma, DE Shaw, or Goldman Sachs is spamming Sr Data Scientist emails to recruit but they want to pay slightly above what a manager at Target makes and with no equity.>""You will be assisting our Data Science Intern in the projects that he is assigned""Any Sr. person willing to take this job shouldn't be Sr. and probably got that title at a dysfunctional startup#Duly noted.

Most positions you apply for are probably already filled but HR didn't bother to take it offline.> This puts me in a difficult spot -- go for the experienced (more expensive) applicants? Or give these fresh-out-of-college/bootcamp candidates that are legitimately interested in thinking outside the box and hungry to learn a chance to prove their skills in an entry-level Jr. role?I personally think a first hire should always be somebody with experience. The boot camp guy sounds like a great hire but only when being managed by somebody with data science experience. #As others have stated....I'm an older student about to re-enter the job market. For every 50 applications I'll get 7 responses for a technical interview and 2-3 sit down interviews. Ill probably apply to 100 places. Industry-related is beneficial, but math is math.#As a BI team lead, seems a no brainer to give the enthusiastic guy a good look at least. Give them an interview and maybe a couple of technical challenges just to check theyre not completely bullshitting, but unless youre putting out commercial consultancy research or something if the guy doesnt get everything right the first time 100% then shouldnt be any massive harm. #I personally would go for the fresh out of college students a chance, I found that enthusiasm goes much further #That's kind of what I was getting at in terms of where a Data Scientist would fit within your existing teams. From your description, it sounds like you've already got a whole research team working on what cryptocurrency markets are and how you can best monitize them. These people have been spending company time becoming experts in that specific domain. It is very unlikely that anyone you hire as a Senior Data Scientist is going to be more of an expert in this domain than the team you've already got (unless the PhD is in that specific area or similar). What your Senior Data Scientist should be an expert in is in finding and testing mathematical relationships that are not obvious and leveraging these relationships towards business problems. One of the general strategies to do this, particularly in a new kind of market without very many direct comparitors, is to take a structured look at the fundamental assumptions underlying your business model and test them as hypotheses. What do you believe to be true about your business, under what circumstances are they actually true, under what circumstances are they not true, and what is their relative importance to your business model? It is important to understand that the value of data science is only realized when you use it to change course. You don't need a data scientist simply to describe a market. You would use a data scientist to predict or influence a market, or to generate and validate prediction models for aspects of a market that cannot be completely observed.#Write your business problems down in the job description :) At worst, your interview candidate will know how to solve that specific problem.#If we're lucky he's taken a Coursera course or two. #[deleted]#Thank you for the insight! I will keep that in mind.#The bootcamp guy has accepted an offer for a 3-month summer paid internship ($5K) with the opportunity for a full-time hire :) Hoping to find the right Sr. level scientist on board to guide him in the right direction before the internship starts.#Yes, we are giving him a shot with a summer internship! The awesome part is that he was ecstatic to receive it, which makes me like him even more.#Mind freaking blown if there's an active GitHub.#> he's taken a Coursera courseEspecially if it is the gold standard Ng ML course#I'm just curious but why the hate and circle jerk on Coursera/Kaggle? For someone that may not be able to afford to go back to school and obtain a PhD I think these are decent resources for delving into Data Science. I have a lot of interest in Data Science and Machine Learning (not an expert of course) and find these resources extremely helpful.#I will keep that in mind and make changes accordingly!#5K for 3 months? #But it's empty except for the Kaggle Titanic kernel work re-uploaded#its sad how good my shitty github seems to make me look. It has been the ""this is why we interviewed you"" on a number of jobs I've applied and been offered.#To be fair, I'm a Sr DS at a high profile company and still go back to both my notes and some of the lectures from this course when brushing up on techniques I don't use a lot.  It's a pretty good course for learning some basics (especially when your brain refuses to permanently grok back propagation).#I think it's a tragedy of the commons situation. On the whole, Coursera/Kaggle are awesome. I think the ribbing is in good fun (after all I would guess that the vast majority of data scientists have taken MOOCs before). We aren't hating on Coursera/Kaggle but rather a specific archetype of user.The person we are making fun of is the same that googles 'high salary good job' and finds out data science is a thing. They then proceed to find this sub, make a self post asking how to become a data scientist in the fastest way possible and get redirected to the sidebar. Then they do the Titanic Kaggle kernel and Ng's Machine Learning MOOC and start applying for data scientist positions. Needless to say, this person would make a trash data scientist.There's nothing wrong with being a beginner. I would be lying if I told you I hadn't taken Ng's ML course and done the titanic Kaggle. However, that was well over a thousand hours of work/study ago. We make fun of the people that want a shortcut without doing the work. If you are utilizing those resources and putting in the work to learn and get better I applaud you. I'm right there with you. #That’s about standard for summer internships for students, in my experience. Not sure if boot camp guy has a degree or just boot camp experience but if it’s the latter I think it’s fair. The last internship I had paid 5K and I was offered one this year that was $5.2K.#He has no degree or any previous experience in finance/CS, so the board of directors agreed that we should be cautious, as we weren't really sure how in-depth and intensive that 6-month bootcamp was.#and forks of coursework repos#I mean the notes are good, but I think completing those courses is a better signal of being a good programmer than a good data scientist. I did that one and the meat of the JHU DS and 9 times out of 10 everyone's complaint was centered around the fact that they didn't know anything about programming. If you have a marginally technical background, those courses are scarily easy.#That makes sense. I can see how that can be annoying. I definitely want to learn the application and discipline with Data Science and Machine Learning as my company is starting to get more into that area. Thank you for your response by the way! #It's not standard anymore. My DS internship paid 8k/mo. That said it's a well known company with a strong data culture. #No problem. Always happy to help out and I don't like gatekeeping attitudes in general.

nosleep;872jpg;1522001900.0;/r/nosleep/comments/872jpg/im_having_a_problem_with_google_photos/;I'm having a problem with Google Photos;"It's been a fairly rough time, but you know I thought I was getting a handle on it, but this is wrecking my head (apologising for the colloquialism). It's been a couple of months now since my wife Laura passed away. Myself and our daughter have been working through our grief and it hasn't been easy, but you know having photos of the three of us has been a help. I've always been the techie one in the family and before the accident I got Laura to setup automatic sharing between us. It's a relatively new feature in Google that does face recognition and automatically shares photos of select people with a partner, me in this case. So I have a copy of all her photos of me, our daughter and family in my online album. It's been a godsend for us. I even have an album of the best ones sharing on our Chromecast at home.Also, being the techie, I went through the painful process of closing Laura's social media accounts and posting final updates. I think it was part of my coping mechanism early on, to focus on practical things that were within my ability. It held back the darkness you know. My wife's Google account is closed. I didn't want to be getting a reminder in a years time from some automated algorithm like Facebook saying ""You haven't heard from Laura in a while."" That's creepy and my daughter is now at the age where she's starting to use social media. It's something I just don't want to have to deal with.So life moves on. Daughter is back in school. I'm back to work. We're trying to go on with things. It's not easy, but you have no choice. And then a few weeks back I got a notification saying new photos had been shared. Freaking odd. I checked them out. It's a couple of real old photos of us before we were married. I assumed it was just a glitch in the data, the algorithms picking up archived stuff. I smiled when I saw them (and cried in my bed thinking about them that night). But you just swallow those feelings down and and move on.And then a week or two later, another notification. This is where it gets freaky. It was just a single photo, of me, asleep in bed. I was a little taken back by it. I checked the settings and I couldn't access Laura's account any more. It's locked out and unusable. But there is that photo. When I got home I checked her mobile phone. (Yea I kept it, I'm a bit of a technology hoarder). It was powered off and had no charge. The account was a bill account, so it was gone as well. So yea, I had to put it down to another glitch in the algorithms. Big data is always a little creepy right? I reason out that it must be an old photo. My wife was a bit of insomniac. I'd be falling asleep at 10pm in the evening, but she wouldn't be able to go to bed until 1am. So one night she must have taken the photo before she went to bed and the algorithm is only now working out my face from the photo. The photo is quite dark, so maybe some new filter has been added to the algorithm and it managed to pick out my face.But that's not all. I got another notification this very morning. This time it's a photo of our daughter sleeping in her bed. Must be the same reason right? The algorithm got better and picked out the faces. But it still creeped me out, like Laura was sending me photos from beyond the grave. So I checked the settings again, checked her account, still can't get in as it's now disabled. Checked her phone. Still off. I then got curious and I downloaded the photos and started checking the metadata, they are both timestamped the night before the accident. What the fuck? I've submitted feedback, I've emailed google about it, hoping they'll just turn it off but I've gotten no response, as you'd expect, it’s googIe. I haven't mentioned it to our daughter. Really not worth making her feel upset about it. Still I feel as if something is off. I don’t believe my own logic about updates to the algorithm either. Why would my wife take these photos the night before. It’s probably nothing, just coincidence right?";That's creepy. It could be someone messing with you.  Keep like a written account of everytime it happens too, see if there is a pattern or something.  Are her accounts deleted or deactivated? (Not tech savvy, but someone might have hacked into her accounts if they are just deactivated.)  Could your daughter have tried messing around with your wife's accounts? Anyway good luck and stay safe my dude.#As long as they’re time stamped before she passed, then I’d agree it’s just a google glitch that they’ll never respond to you about.  But if some start having a time stamp after she was gone, then you better start worrying.  Just be happy you have the pictures  she must have loved you both very much.#I wonder if it has anything to do with machine learning. You know like dark photos were fed into a machine and trained to pick up faces and now they're creating their own images with the faces in your albums?#Bbut how can you explain those pics?#[removed]

AMANinja edit: it might be nice to know your background#[deleted]#My company hired 6 data scientists last year, we don't give a shit about where you got your diploma, we care about what you can do (tests and discussions during the interview process), what you have done (personal projects, hackathons, internships etc), and if you can function as a human being and be part of the group (ie not a spergin bitcoin trading fedora wearing goon).All this KUL / ULB crap you read here it totally irrelevant.#ULB/VUB have oldest AI lab in Belgium and in Europe if I'm not mistaken. If you go for something AI related I'd definitely check out Brussels. On big data I think their speciality is language/semantical analysis, with successful start-ups like [Collibra](https://www.collibra.com/).Edit: Oh wow what's with the Brussels hate in this thread?#I did the engineering track at KUL while working in Brussels. I didn't go to most of the classes and followed it remotely. The teachers and staff are definitely helpful. Let me know if you've any questions.#> and not really well knownThis should not be a concern for any degree in Belgium. *None* are known to the outside world (if this is what you meant).I have no experience in these specific degrees but I can't imagine one or the other holding you back in the future. ULB and KUL are both fine universities, can't go wrong.#MrsFingers is a KUL-alumnus, and now works for the VUB. And even she says: ""if it's for a degree, go KUL, that name alone can open doors that remain shut otherwise"". Brussels-Leuven commute should not be an issue, as there are plenty of trains between both cities, even a direct line between Leuven and the eastern part of Brussels (Luxemburg, Etterbeek,...). As /u/Understeps already said, the name & reputation of the institute has quite a substantial impact on the value of your degree. It shouldn't be the case, but it is.#[deleted]#Go for ugent. Multiple people working for Google/Spotify/.... In big data. The elis research group is internationally renowned. They were on the front page of Nature some time ago, which I think is the most prestigious of all if am not mistaken.#Many thanks, so cool to find an alumni over here! I'm an economist but I have experience with data/text mining and statistical analysis, and I'm a lot into pattern discovery and clustering algorithms. I'm also thinking of doing the Big Data specialisation  however, is it true that the Big Data Analytics course is very difficult?What were your favourite courses? What to avoid? Did you find a job in the field?Also, did you do it full-time?#Hello, very interesting to find someone like you here. Currently in 1st Bach Ingenieurswetenschappen at KUL. If this is what you studied than tell me all about it because I’m thinking of going in to hoofdrichting CS#What kind of work are you hoping to get in to?#Thank you! KUL is indeed a very good university and I'd be super pumped to study there! However, I've been there a couple of times for administrative stuff and it was a bit awful: the delayed trains, coming into work late... also, the computer science building is 10 minutes from the station by bike. Do you know the ULB as well? It sounds like a good university.#Do you have any experience with the ULB?#Eh, the difference in ranking between ULB and KUL is negligable on a worldwide basis and based on research-output more than the instruction you'll receive. They're probably about equally ""known"". EDIT: Lol, @ the petty downvotes. KUL: 47, ULB: 175 on the Times Higher Education ranking that includes thousands of universities, seriously, that's a negligible difference, especially given that the KUL's scale means that it'll d'office have a higher research-output and thus higher ranking, given that these rankings are not about the quality of education. Hey, last Nobel Prize winner for Belgium was from the ULB, but whatever, guess the fact that half the Nobel-prize winners in Belgium were ULB alumni is just coincidence. #What's your company called? (if not a secret). I already have a job, but they're not super into AI stuff although there would be a lot of potential imho. #Thank you, that's really interesting, actually. Rather difficult to find info though. Did you study there? #Thank you for your answer! How did it go, doing it remotely? Is the material put on the server sufficient? Do you nevertheless have to go to the practical classes, or do you just turn in projects? Were you going a few times a week to Leuven?Also, regarding courses, did you take Bioinformatics, or Uncertainty in AI? How was Programming Frameworks? (the one with Prolog). Did you have to take Basic Programming?Many, many thanks!#No degrees wherever are known to the outside world!KUL is ranked relatively high, so KUL is known to the outside world. Which is what matters in some circles. #Sure it's not Stanford but KUL have good rep especially in their crypto courses and academic activities isn't it? #Thank you! My concern was that the ULB degree is really very new (I think it was set up last year). I also don't know anyone who graduated there. Maybe their master is really good, but it's hard to know. #Many thanks, really cool about MrsFingers! I'll look more into the trains from Luxembourg, I didn't know there were any, going from Ixelles to Bruxelles Central was kind of inconvenient. Thanks a lot!#Thank you, really cool! How did you like the MAI? Any particular recommendations? Do you prefer Ugent?#Thanks for the advice! Sounds cool, but do they have an AI program? I know they have the master in statistical data analysis, which has some big data component, but I'm looking for something a bit more on the computer science side.#First some background of myself. I did the Master in Engineering: Computer Science (MCS) with a specialisation in AI before the Advanced Master in AI (MAI). So I already had lots of experience with programming and AI. I didn't even have to take every compulsory course as I either had already done that or I already had enough experience with it (e.g. Fundamentals of AI, Machine Learning and Inductive Inference, Data Mining).>I'm also thinking of doing the Big Data specialisation  however, is it true that the Big Data Analytics course is very difficult?I can't compare the Big Data Analytics (BDA) track to the Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) track as I only did the former but in my 3 years of doing AI-related masters, I followed at least all compulsory courses in both tracks. But I can't comment on the workload (also because I didn't do a thesis in the MAI). I'd say all courses are definitely manageable if you have a sufficient background in mathematics and programming paradigms (basic knowledge of HTML and JS is not sufficient).>What were your favourite courses?By far my favourite course was Brain Computer Interfaces. Very interesting course and not the most difficult exam. The 2 exercise sessions were the coolest ever.Other cool courses are:- Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Computing- Biometrics System Concepts- Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks: 2 courses given by the same professor. They both have the same structure but handle different subjects. Don't be a bitch by choosing ANNs because it's a buzzword. Take either none or both.- Text-based Information Retrieval- Computer Vision- Data Mining- Fundamentals of AI: I think everyone can agree that Danny is the best professor ever- Big Data Analytics Programming- Machine Learning and Inductive InferenceThe last 4 courses are compulsory in the BDA track. In the ECS track, the last 4 courses except for Big Data Analytics Programming are compulsory.>What to avoid?No idea. There are some courses I didn't enjoy as much as the courses above (e.g. Uncertainty in AI) but those are still very important to do. I think Uncertainty in AI is even a compulsory course in the ECS track.>Did you find a job in the field?Coincidentally, after working 6 months as a software developer, I started as a data scientist and data engineer today.I'm sure I could have started in the exact same function if I hadn't done the MAI as my MCS was already heavily AI-focused. But I'm still glad I did the MAI as I could spread interesting courses over 2 years: my last year of MCS and MAI. In my last MCS year, I did some non-AI courses which I wouldn't have done if I didn't plan to do the MAI. I then took on the interesting AI courses which I missed in my MCS in my MAI.>Also, did you do it full-time?Yes, I did it full-time. Some people do the 1 year master in 2 years, that's very much accomodated by the programme.#>tell me all about itWhat do you want to know?#I started as a Data Scientist and Data Engineer today. I did 6 months of software development before today.#[deleted]#Add the fact that a common problem for ULB (and VUB too for that matter) is that sometimes researchers write Université Libre de Brussels, sometimes Free University of Brussels. In the end, ULB loses numbers of papers due to this translation problem (Free University of Brussels not being counted for ULB), and asked the researchers a while back to use the correct spelling.#> KUL: 47, ULB: 175  Doesn't sound like a negligible difference to me.  #I studied at the VUB but not anywhere near AI or big data. What I know comes from the fact that I once was a student representative.#It was not easy but doable if you have the background (I have BSc in computer science). Almost all the classes have their content on their online platform. I think only exception was philosophy of mind for which I go to class. I was going one or two days per week, mostly for the labs. Prolog is one of the classes that require you to attend the labs. I didn't take bioinformatics but did take the uncertainty. It was one of the most interesting class imo. Didn't take basic programming. If you need to take the basic programming, engineering track might be though for you. Depends on your motivation. Feel free to go talk to the programme director. They're very helpful. PM me if you need more information. Also try to get a car if possible. I regret doing it with the train and bus, it was more unpleasant for me than the exams :)#I'm a postdoc researcher doing research in Bioinformatics (at KUL). If you want to do bioinformatics, don't take that course. If you want to learn some Bayesian approaches, take that course.#In Belgium, both universities are equally well known. Outside Belgium, I doubt KUL is much better known than ULB. Maybe a tiny little bit, but I really wouldn't base any life-changing decision on that.#It is relatively high ranked in the charts but imo this is completely meaningless, the ranking is super arbitrary and not normalized. Having studied both in Brussels and KUL I have not noticed a significant change in quality of education. (Anecdotal, but my worse classes were in fact at KUL).I would argue in favor of KUL for a wider available program. But if you have found an interesting program in Brussels that suits you, there's really no reason to go to KUL for ""prestige"" or ""better education"".edit: I also doubt anyone has heard of KUL (or any Belgian uni) outside of Belgium. Unless you work in a very niche sector of course. But for big data I doubt it.#Very new programs might be a concern honestly. It takes time to set-up a quality education and 2 years is definitely not enough.#Yes, it's the S9 train going between Leuven & Eigenbrakel (Braine-l'Alleud). It does not go via the troubled North-South line which is terribly congested, so that train often rides without (substantial) delays. It's not a real fast one, since it stops in some villages between Brussels & Leuven as well, but that allows you to read some papers or get some other work done. For fares it doesn't matter, as it's ""Zone Brussel"" to ""Zone Leuven"" anyway. Whether you board in Etterbeek, Ukkel, Vorst, Brussels Midi or Jette.#[deleted]#They do not have an AI programme.#They have a very broad selection of optional courses. You don't get labeled as 'AI student', but you can choose from artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, datacentertechnology, computer vision, robotics, natural language processing, .... That's what I did, and I couldn't be happier. The knowledge I gained was certainly sufficient to get started in the real world and land me a job I liked.#Congrats on the new job, and thank you for the very detailed and insightful answer!I'm very much on the fence between ECS and BDA. On the one hand, I like the electives of ECS more, on the other, it has Programming Frameworks, and I hate Prolog with the strength of a thousand suns. But BDA doesn't have Artificial Neural Networks. Definitely planning to take SVMs and Text-based Information Retrieval, and also thinking about Large-Scale Social Networks.What about Bioinformatics? It seems like a more hands-on approach to Bayesian learning than AI and Inference, and I've heard really good things about Yves Moreau.#Thank you for sharing all this information, that's really great! May I ask how come you didn't have to do a thesis within the MAI? Just asking because I've already been though two theses and not looking forward to a third one...#How did you like the courses? Which options did you pick? What classes are good to go to, which aren’t? Is it fun? Is it hard? Which ‘nevenrichting’ did you pick? How’s job opportunity? First wage? Thanks in advance.#> and generally their students aren't as studious and seem to focus more on binge drinking and partying than their course.Lolwhat, did you just say that students of the ULB drink more and study less than those of the KUL? #What a bunch of crap lmao.#Then you don't understand the rankings very well. #Right, thanks a lot! I'm more drawn to the BDA one for now because of the statistics and data mining courses, but I'm an economist so maybe they won't let me.Definitely planning on taking the car, been going twice by train + Brompton (one time when it was - 7) and it was pretty exhausting. #Thank you! Indeed, it's the Bayes stuff I'm mostly interested in. Would you recommend Bioinformatics, or Uncertainty in AI? #KUL appears in all top 100 rankings, ULB does not. It doesn't matter so much in Europe, but if you want an international career, or an academic career, it does matter. #For what it's worth, I studied at UCL, ULB & KUL and KUL is the only one of the three that anybody ever remembered outside Belgium. (In computer science). #KUL is way better known outside of Belgium, at least in my experience. Had people ask if I went to KUL a couple times when working abroad. No one ever mentioned ULB/VUB out of the blue. #KUL has exquis label in business which is known internationally and means it's in the top 50 universities for economics#Well, i think you don't know what you're talking about and expressing your personal opinion rather than facts.However i'm not telling that OP should consider ULB education as worse. But KUL have indeed high rankings, that have impact on employment whatever your opinion about it.>Unless you work in a very niche sector of course.Ah yeah, the very niche sector of computer sciences KUL is known about. #Indeed!#Thank you for the insights! #You can also take ANNs in the BDA track, at least I did.>What about Bioinformatics? It seems like a more hands-on approach to Bayesian learning than AI and Inference, and I've heard really good things about Yves Moreau.I have nothing bad to say about Yves Moreau, he's a good teacher. But bio-informatics is definitely not hands-on. It's very theoretical and mathematical. In fact, it's the only course I didn't pass in the MAI. Mostly because I'm an avid class skipper and because I thought the exam would be more practical.#The thesis in my MCS was about machine learning, i.e. a subject which could definitely be a thesis subject in the MAI.If I'm not mistaken, you can replace the thesis by an internship.Just curious: are 2 masters not enough for you?#See my other posts in this thread for the answers to your questions except for:>First wage?€1800 net + bonuses#[deleted]#[deleted]#I think I do.#Don't know about the Uncertainty in AI course. It has also been a while since I was a student, but if the Bayesian stuff is as outdated as it was then, then neither are really practical. We've come a long way since the early days of Bayesian inference. Nowadays with all the recent variational/Hamiltonean approaches the field has changed quite a bit. #>  but if you want an international career, or an academic career, it does matter.I can at least answer about the academic career, as it is my field. No, the university where you studied doesn't matter in the slightest way. What matters is the university where you did your PhD (a bit), the university where you did your post-doc(s) (a bit more, bonus points for US universities), and the number of papers published in high impact factor journals (a *lot* more important).#To add to that, KUL is this year ranked as the best European university (IIRC).#> But KUL have indeed high rankings, that have impact on employment whatever your opinion about it.Fine I can agree with this.> Ah yeah, the very niche sector of computer sciences KUL is known about. I don't understand if I'm reading this correctly and you are being sarcastic (please clarify)? Computer sciences is not exactly a niche sector.#Ok, that's definitely good to know!#Thanks!#[And nobody in Leuven ever drinks, which is why the firebrigade is continually picking up black-out drunk students](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/02/23/leuvense_studentenalsmaarvakerdronkenafgevoerd/). I'm not implying ""the opposite"" is true, I'm implying that the idea that ULB students drink more and study less than KUL students is based on nothing and a silly assertion to make. #You're really not in a position to take the high ground here after claiming the quality of education at KUL is better because you feel like ""they drink too much and don't study enough in Brussels"".Please leaborate on your experiences with the VUB/ULB. Did you study there? Or have you worked there? Or is it limited to ""a mate has been there once to party""?#Then explain to me why the difference between 47 and 175 is significative, given the size of the universities in question, given the bias towards anglophone publications and given that the rankings run well in the thousands. Hell, explain to me what you think these rankings actually rank, then explain to me why that difference in ranking is interesting. #Thanks a lot! #I doubt it's better than Oxford or ETH.#Yes. It's a sarcasm.#[deleted]#[deleted]#> Then explain to me why the difference between 47 and 175 is significative  Because that's just how rankings work. It's inherently subjective but few people would say that the difference between place 47 and 175 is small.  #It's a silly statement to make, especially based of ""anecdotes"". Having both experience with the KUL and the ULB, my personal anecdotes don't match yours. Which is coincidentally why I think it's a silly statement, there's no point to it. :)>  and I don't understand why so many of you are so personally offended by it. Lol, yea, I can't for the life of my understand why people would take that badly. #> I owe you not a single grain of explanationYou are right. I asked for clarification so that we could evaluate the quality of your personal opinion. Considering your vague answers it is not very credible at all. In my opinion at least.#Given that you can be ranked over 1000 and that the difference between the ranking of a university from one year to the other can switch with over a 100, the difference between 47 and 175 on these kind of lists is actually nothing. Again, you don't seem to know what these rankings measure, it's not a football-table. > but few people would sayIf they understood what was ranked they would. :) You haven't explained to me how this difference is *significative* given the size, anglophone bias, etc. Please do.First of all: what do you think this ranking measures? Just saying ""Well, duh, number X is higher than number Y"" doesn't really show you understood what we're talking about. #[deleted]#[deleted]#> You should share your anecdotes!Why? They're not very interesting. The ULB is a fine enough institution. The KUL has more money and has a better IT-infrastructure in my experience but the worth of the degree is going to be equivalent. If you don't like the idea of a commute (which can get tiring, especially if you need to do job-study-home) then you might as well choose ULB over KUL, but each institution has its pro's and con's. You don't need to drink to study at the ULB nor do you need to tee-total at the KUL (Oude Markt is a thing for a reason, but I think OP is not in it for the student-experience). Oh, ULB has the better coffee.On a sidenote, I'd advise to take the length of the program into account, KUL masters are 1 year, ULB masters usually 2. (EDIT: seems to be a one year master at the ULB, I like the fact that it's actually a Masters in collaboration with several institutions like Solvay and the VUB). #Well to be completely fair it's not my fault you are understanding the word elaborate wrong.

Michael Flynn, speaking then as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said that such open-source data initiatives, and in particular the study of social media such as Facebook, had entirely transformed intelligence-gathering. He reported that traditional signals intelligence and human intelligence were increasingly being replaced by this open-source work and that the way in which intelligence agents are trained had been modified to accommodate the shift. A growing portion of the military’s $50 billion budget would be spent on this data analytics work, he claimed, creating a “gold rush” for contractors. A few weeks after this interview, Flynn left the DIA to establish the Flynn Intel Group Inc.

The appeal of Facebook and Twitter are that they're free and everyone is already on them. Nobody is going to move to a less-used, harder-to-use, and paid service.So the data-hoarders of the world will rejoice for many decades to come.#https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/18/books/how-the-cia-played-dirty-tricks-with-culture.html#Not to excuse it but basically this is a really weak version of what the Soviets did for decades. They were (and Russians still are) the best at disseminating propaganda via intelligence groups. Mostly conspiracies.And yes, regarding this article... our intel agencies have done some heinous things throughout the years. Which is why it's so utterly *insane* that left-of-center people now have to defend groups like the CIA and FBI against the right.So despite the fact that people in the FBI tried to infiltrate and destroy every leftist political group in the 20th century, liberals are now the keepers of the flame that is law as enforced by FBI and DOJ.

I’m concerned that deep data will *shade* discussion towards one direction or another more easily.

Im afraid that this will continue and be more and more subtle. Poorly thought out on my part but I hope you understand my concern. Luck#Oh I agree. It's wild to me that I used to watch what Obama was doing and think ""well so much for the liberal agenda... this guy is dead center not even left at all despite what he said on the campaign trail.""Then you turn on Fox news and they're screaming that he's a socialist and a secret Kenyan and all this.

AustralianPolitics;868k6w;1521689315.0;/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/868k6w/compulsory_voting_and_big_data/;Compulsory voting and big data;"Just curious to get your thoughts on this. I don't really see this being talked about at all, and I think it's a concern.So, only a handful of countries throughout the world have *enforced* compulsory voting. I think about 12 in the whole word. Australia, obviously, is one of them.  Big data can create incredibly personalized and targeted advertisements. That's all well and good for products and other general consumer things, but what about politics?I think compulsory voting enhances the effect that big data can have on politics. People who are completely uninformed suddenly get an ad on their phone with fear mongering or emotional tugging and they vote based on their feelings rather than brains. The reason I think compulsory voting adds to this issue, is because I'm willing to bet that most of these emotional and uninformed people wouldn't even be making it to the polls to begin with. The fact that we are essentially forced to means these people will think emotionally and vote with their heart rather than their brain. No one wants to sit and analyze policies, so they'll just cast their mind back a few weeks, remember the sensationalist headline or ad and vote based on that. What do I think the longer term effects are? Well, it's already kind of happening. Parties win based on emotion and charisma rather than policies. This isn't unique to countries with compulsory voting (USA springs to mind), but I think compulsory voting is a catalyst for this sort of political landscape. I think it makes it so much easier to target emotional and ""manipulative"" ads when the entire nation has to partake in voting. I think, and this is getting a bit conspiracy-like, that the reason we've seen some very questionable policies come into effect is because of targeted political ads mixed with compulsory voting. People who are immensely uniformed are, for a lack of a better word, being 'guided' towards voting for certain parties based on their stance on emotional issues.So, curious to hear your thoughts on the matter :) EDIT: My post isn't about the efficacy of compulsory vs. non-compulsory voting - it's about the efficacy of big data and propaganda used to sway elections in a compulsory environment vs. a non-compulsory one. Simply because you don't need to figure out who will vote and who wont - you assume everyone is voting and target accordingly. When using big data, stuff like that makes it so much easier to work with. ";"Look at the shitshow in the US with the opposite, very low turn out. Who's politics is more extreme and partisan?No mandatory voting changes the political calculus from convincing people to making people that already agree with you afraid enough to go vote. It's why you have so many more single issue voters there. Emotion and charisma is vastly more dangerous without mandatory voting.#[removed]#I think compulsory voting works to prevent rather than enhance polarisation and the so called emotion voting.Targeted ads are best used to encourage populations to vote when they do not have to, they would be much less successful where everyone has to vote anyway.#Thats what they thought in the USA. But then all the crazys turned out to vote in Donny T. Now they are stuck with him. Compulsory voting ensures we will never have a Donny T, also being a parliamentary government prevens someone with zero political knowlage becoming leader of the countryThere is nothing wrong with targeted ads/ campaign. This has been happening for eons. Yes its a stronger weapon now but a political party wanting to talk specifically to their base.... thats just democracy As for your concern that it makes extreme people more extreme, it does but not just to right wing extremes, left are equally susceptible. While extreme left arnt as dangerous physically as extreme right they bring their own dangers to a country#Voting isn't compulsory. Turning up and getting your name crossed off is though.And sausage sizzles at polling booths should be!#I think it's wrong that privacy laws don't apply to political parties#Read more, guess less. One of the targeting techniques used in the 2016 US election was to manipulate people who supported Bernie Sanders to not vote.You've got it arse about.#>People who are completely uninformed suddenly get an ad on their phone with fear mongering or emotional tugging and they vote based on their feelings rather than brains.1937:People who are completely uninformed suddenly get an ad in their newspaper with fear mongering or emotional tugging and they vote based on their feelings rather than brains.1977:People who are completely uninformed suddenly get an ad in their newspaper with fear mongering or emotional tugging and they vote based on their feelings rather than brains.#It’s just as likely compulsory voting protects our system from manipulation by data driven targeting. After all Trump and Brexit - two outcomes not reflecting actual majority preferences in their eligible electorate - occurred in nations without compulsory voting. And now it seems that data driven targeting was a factor in each.In the absence of compulsory voting its the voter who cares about a single emotive issue who can be motivated (manipulated) to get up and vote that can determine the outcome. Big data can and now has been used to target voters with very narrow interests who may otherwise stay home on Election Day. It might be regrettable but perhaps people with moderate balanced views and open minds are so because they are less tribal or less worked up about immigrants or baby killers or government tyranny or a hundred other hot button issues. And maybe moderates are less likely to vote if they don’t have to. In which case without compulsory voting policies will tend to pander to tribes and become contradictory and chaotic as a result.I think it is likely that, by keeping moderates in play, compulsory voting makes it harder to use big data to game the system. Educated or not, it’s the passionate who have the strongest biases and who are as a result most likely to be manipulated. There is also the effect on marginal efficacy. The larger the percentage of the enfranchised exercising their vote the greater the number of voters data driven targeting has to manipulate to alter the outcome. We do need to be concerned. But I don’t think big data presents a prima face case against compulsory voting. It may in fact be quite the opposite.#> they vote based on their feelings rather than brains.So Greens voters?I think How To Vote cards should be banned first. Why should morons be told how to vote? Research or vote 1.>This isn't unique to countries with compulsory voting (USA springs to mind)Isn't it strange how the left here and in the US were all on board with Zuckerborg and youtube when they were - as Obama's political advisor stated ""on their side"" - but when Hillary crashed and burned there's suddenly all this hysteria about swaying the public with ads. That's politics.I do think politicians or political parties should be able to sue for defamation is their opposition slanders them in ads or during speeches. It would be very interesting to see what would happen then.#I don't like using the US as a comparison. They have a vastly different political landscape, and a lot of people who simply aren't happy with the options.The US is simply apathetic right now. They had what, 58% voter turn out? That's not healthy, and shows an underlying issue with the nation.>Emotion and charisma is vastly more dangerous without mandatory votingI will agree when the nation is split in 2 this happens. I think that's why in the US there was so much ""us vs. them"" being spouted. I'm not quite sure Australia is in a similar boat#>Far too many ""I think's"" in there to take your hypothetical theorising seriously. Isn't that the whole point of hypothesis?>without that info your witterings are all pure conjecture.Hence the I thinks. This is a discussion about something that I never hear about. Big data is rarely brought up with regards to politics, especially in AustraliaEveryone is turning the topic into compulsory voting. As someone who works with ""big data"" I know exactly how powerful it can be. This topic, ultimately, is about big data being used in politics coupled with compulsory voting. I think because of compulsory voting, big data influence can have a major, major effect, and more than in non-mandatory countries.>Our voting is an obligation as well as a right and I feel that should be respected by asking all eligible to do so.I disagree. I think voting is a right not a duty. 12 countries out of 195 would agree with you though. >I see little difference between those who make their mind up at the last minute on a single political issue and those who slavishly vote as advised by a newspaper, shock jock or religious leader as none of them are evaluating the totality of wider picture to the extent that I imagine you think you do. I don't see a difference either. And I think it's just as poor, and part of the issue with compulsory voting.Its ludicrous to think that the average person has a grasp on politics. Big data could easily away the average person, and when more ""average"" people are voting, it could sway the election. All of a sudden we have governments built on whoever has the best propaganda. Just look at Scandanavian nations or NZ for an example of non mandatory voting working. Why is the comparison always USA? #>also being a parliamentary government prevents someone with zero political knowledge becoming leader of the countryI think that's the stark difference between us and the USA. I also think the USA created a divide between the population just to create this scenario. >There is nothing wrong with targeted ads/ campaign. This has been happening for eons.If by eons you mean 10 or so years, than sure. But I don't think it's been at this level for more than 5 or so years. There's always been ""low tech"" targeted ads, but big data can change the game. >As for your concern that it makes extreme people more extremeMy concern isn't that it makes the extreme more extreme, it's that it makes someone who isn't informed and who wouldn't have voted, vote with emotion rather than brain. Extremists are a minority, by definition. My issue is with the average person voting with the first emotional issue that springs into their mind rather than thinking critically about voting. If voting wasn't compulsory, i believe that these people wouldn't be at the booths. Targeting ads helps create an emotional issue they'll remember#I mean for the sake of the argument it is. We have a 95% participation compared to 40-75% for non compulsory countries. #Right.I guess what I'm trying to discuss is something that isn't talked about - big data targeted ads on an apathetic voter.We hear stories from the US such as the one you described, and that's fair enough. I agree that voter suppression in the form of propoganda could happen in a non mandatory voting environments.In Europe, voter participation is decreasing rapidly, from 80% in the 80s to 65%. I would argue that means, worldwide, voter apathy is increasing. Australias 2016 election had the lowest turn out rates since 1925.So, in Europe apathetic voters simply don't vote. Here though, they are forced to. The question I'm posing is due to the rise in voter apathy, could the effect of emotional, targeted ads be higher? Especially in a compulsory setting.#Ah but the difference is it was somewhat voluntary. You can't really compare the marketing sphere from almost 100 years ago to now#>Isn't it strange how the left here and in the US were all on board with Zuckerborg and youtube when they were - as Obama's political advisor stated ""on their side"" - but when Hillary crashed and burned there's suddenly all this hysteria about swaying the public with ads. That's politics.That is an interesting comparison. Both tactics are used to sell products but now that it's used to sell governments all hell breaks loose#Mandatory voting helps ensure the country *doesn't* split in two. Median voter theory doesn't hold when you're better off appealling to just your base.#[removed]#>Its ludicrous to think that the average person has a grasp on politics.Why do you have such a disdain for the general public? Who do you think you are? We're sorry for being so very very stupid.#> Extremists are a minority, by definition.Thats why compulsory voting ensures a moderating influence on politics, by making sure the majority turn out at the election. #>If voting wasn't compulsory, i believe that these people wouldn't be at the booths.I agree with you.You also think that the public is too stupid to decide what happens to them.That's why we need everyone to vote. To make sure that paternalistic people like you, don't dictate to us apparently stupid people what's good for us.#But if you make voting voluntary (for the sake of the argument), wouldn't you only get the extremists making the effort? And given that CBF is pretty much a national pastime, I would predict a terrible turnout below those figures.#>You can't really compare the marketing sphere from almost 100 years ago to nowYou mean when most people got their news and information from the information bubble that they chose to buy into?#They are desperate to get all the information sources under strict control before the next federal election in the US. The leftist management of Youtube are heavily attacking conservative channels - demonetizing or shutting them down. They clearly want Trump gone.The thing is, people are more savvy now. They know they are lied to every night on the news and are much more careful trusting any media outlet. That's good. If you think the media is perfectly fine, you have drunk the kool aid.Take the ABC. To anyone but the far left it's obviously biased and has a clear agenda.#I suppose.I mean, only 6% of the countries in the world have compulsory voting. Rest of the world must be split in 2.You missed the major point of the post, which is in the title, which is the effect big data can have on a nation who partakes in compulsory voting. My argument is that targeted political ads/propaganda is *more* effective in a compulsory environment than in a non-compulsory one. This is because there is only 1 state of the voter: they have to vote. You can be far more specific with your targeting because the only variable is who to vote for. You can prey on people's emotions a lot more, because they all have to go and pen something in. With non-compulsory voting, the only form of attack is to goad voters into not attending. This is because there are 2 states of the voter - voting and not voting. It's harder to distinguish who the voters are and who the non-voters are, so it's easier to just make everyone not vote. You could try and emotionally manipulate the voters, but I would argue that the voters who will vote in a non-compulsory election are far more switched on than ones who are forced to vote in a compulsory election. Personally, I think dealing with ""dont vote"" is easier than dealing with emotional voting. I think it's easier to combat. #> I want to compel casual freethinkers to contribute their vote.And that's the point of my post. Is it really ""free thinking"" in the advent of big data and targeted ads? Is it really ""free thinking"" when computers can spit out with 99% confidence how the person will vote, and ads appear pushing the correct emotional buttons? My argument is that targeted political ads/propaganda is more effective in a compulsory environment than in a non-compulsory one.This is because there is only 1 state of the voter: they have to vote. You can be far more specific with your targeting because the only variable is who to vote for.

Quite a bit of a jump there matey#It's not about intelligence, it's about caring enough to make an informed decision.I'm talking about apathy, not intelligence. Grasp was probably the wrong word.I have faith, but I don't have faith when propaganda machines extend their tentacles into people's lives on a scale which, quite honestly, has only been done in extremist countries in the past. #And when the majority is swayed by propaganda and big data, that's ultimately a win?I agree with the concept of compulsory voting, but I think it's too easy to manipulate in reality. We always talk about USA as why non-mandatory voting sucks - but look at countries like NZ and Scandinavian nations. Why does it work so well there?I mean the fact is that non-compulsory voting works. Only 12 countries out of 195 enforce compulsory voting. But that doesn't mean that compulsory voting *doesn't* work. My post, which has been misconstrued by almost every comment, isn't about the efficacy of compulsory vs. non-compulsory voting - it's about the efficacy of big data and propaganda used to sway elections in a compulsory environment vs. a non-compulsory one. #I mean you only have to look as far as the NBN to figure out that maybe the public doesn't truly have their own best interests at heart.Anyway, as I said in my previous comment, it's not an intelligence issue it's an apathy issue. This isnt unique to Australia it's happening all around the world with disconnected voters who simply don't care#Maybe. You make a valid point. I think I just have more faith in the average person. I mean we had a non compulsory plebiscite which everyone got around. There's a lot of examples where regular people come out of the woodwork for non-compulsory things, not just extremists #I mean if you want to oversimplify it that much sure.If you think an ad in a 1937 newspaper is as effective as a personalised, timed and targeted ad on Facebook then I got news for you#Can i ask why you need to make up comments?.the abc is far from biased.https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/abc-cleared-of-antibusiness-bias-in-independent-review-20160722-gqbp68.htmlhttps://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/audits-exonerate-abc-over-bias-claims/news-story/3ad4ba13a0751a74c2b417c13dcb52d6?sv=750277daa4d7ebae8068bf8836adb38f&nk=46df3c743a9022a0e5d6619ac013ce1f-1521901683there are 3 other reviews that have been launced since 2014..all find the same resultThe audit of 51 7.30 stories and 46 Lateline stories was undertaken by journalist Gerald Stone.Stone found that overall coverage on Lateline and 7.30 included a wide range of opinions and was given appropriate air time.A separate audit of ABC radio coverage of the 2013 federal election campaign found no evidence of bias.#I would suggest looking at *who* was targetted by big data analytics. Extreme Bernie Sanders voters, Black separatists, Jill Stein voters, all kinds of racists and anti-immigrant extremists etc. Preying on the fears of an entire populace is much harder to do than targeting interest groups who have relatively much more power in a low-turn out system. It's not really about who's engaged or not, manipulation targets people with extreme populist views that may consider themselves very engaged. The top issues concerning Australia are always boring things like jobs and education because most people *aren't* engaged ideologues.#If anything its easier to manipulate countries without compulsory voting because you can target the opposing side with messaging designed to get them not to turn out. iirc thats exactly what Cambridge Analytica did to Bernie supporters. Its a tactic often used in the US: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States#>I mean you only have to look as far as the NBN to figure out that maybe the public doesn't truly have their own best interests at heart.The NBN says to me that one particular political party doesn't truly have their own best interests at heart.>Anyway, as I said in my previous comment, it's not an intelligence issue it's an apathy issue. Nope - you said: *Its ludicrous to think that the average person has a grasp on politics.*How do you solve apathy by letting people be more apathetic? That's like trying to solve obesity with chicken schnitzels. #Its easy to fill out a 1 question form and pist it back. Its another issue to goto a school on a sunday and waiting in line and voting#What if that is where they choose to get their news and information from.  Back then, there were less options and less ways to double-check or research.  Now there are way more options and information is available and multiple ways to verify something is at everybodies fingertips.#Thanks for actually responding to the question I posed.I suppose that ultimately, I don't think Australia will become a low turn out system. There isn't such a divide between classes nor is there such a divide amongst races. I also don't believe that there are that many extremist groups in Australia. America is a very unique case, an outlier if you will.I mean, that stuff doesn't happen in NZ, Scandanvia, most of western europe.I guess, ultimately, it's just conjecture. I don't think looking at the USA is a good parallel, which is what I wanted to avoid with this question.#So, what comparisons between the US in a political landscape can you find with Australia?The reason I don't want to discuss US in this is because politically we are completely different. From the parties stances all the way to how electorates are made, it's different. Apples and oranges.A better comparison would be NZ.Only thing I can find about voting suppression in that country is apathetic young people who don't identify with politics. I think that's my point - if you can't be bothered voting you shouldn't have to. Otherwise, you will not care when forced to and are easily manipulated. The people who *do care* are less easily manipulated. That's just my point. We have a massively apathetic youth who can't be bothered/doesn't care (as does the rest of the democratic world) and they're forced to vote. I think these people are easily manipulated. That's really the point of my post, others are turning it into something it's not#>Nope - you said:And I clarified. The words I used were wrong and painted the wrong picture of what I was trying to say. I don't have a grasp on Married At First Sight because I don't care about it, not because my brain can't comprehend it. >How do you solve apathy by letting people be more apathetic?See, that's the thing. We're forcing apathetic people to turn up, who haven't done their research. Targeted ads have already done a number on them, so they are simply voting based on whatever ads resonated with them, with a bit of personal preference sprinkled in.I think that's *more* dangerous than apathy and simply not voting. We're in a new age where ads are *incredibly effective*. Do we want governments built on who has the best ads? Or who has the best policies? By forcing people to vote who have no interest to, I think we are increasing how effective targeted ads are in the political sphere. That's not to say that they're not effective in non mandatory voting states, but I think their effect is magnified in a compulsory environment.There hasn't really been a study showcasing the difference. Australia is in a very unique position, and I just wanted to discuss the effect on Australia.>The NBN says to me that one particular political party doesn't truly have their own best interests at heart.Someone had to vote the policy in#Ha well if it wasn't compulsory you probably wouldn't have to wait in line  ) Anyway you do make a good point. I guess that's why I wanted to discuss my thoughts further#>Its another issue to goto a school on a sunday and waiting in line and votingI go in the afternoon.I don't think I've ever waited any more than about 2 minutes. How hard is that?#True. But the people who double check and verify their sources aren't the ones to worry about. #>I suppose that ultimately, I don't think Australia will become a low turn out system. There isn't such a divide between classes nor is there such a divide amongst races.There is in the UK, which is the mother of Westminster parliaments.#>  it's about the efficacy of big data and propaganda used to sway electionsYeah, how could the US possibly be relevant! Its not like the big data propaganda company that best exemplifies your fears has been touting their influence over US elections or anything. > The people who do care are less easily manipulated.The people who care less arent engaged, they're less likely to be persuaded by propaganda because they're simply not engaging with it. They go to work, come home, have dinner, watch the 6 o'clock news and reality tv before going to bed. Repeat. Its the people on the fringes who spend all their time engaging in political content that are more susceptible to political messaging because they're seeking it out. #>Someone had to vote the policy inAnd building the NBN properly would have been amazing.#But you do have to wait in line because when it’s not compulsary they just have fewer booths. The other issue is that because it’s moot compulsary there is an incentive to make it easier to vote in areas more likely to vote for your party than areas likely opposed to you. Like you see happening to black neighbourhoods in Republican states in the US.#>Yeah, how could the US possibly be relevant! Its not like the big data propaganda company that best exemplifies your fears has been touting their influence over US elections or anything. And they've come out and touted their influence over Australia too. That's why I wanted to hear people's opinions on whether compulsory voting is more or less susceptible. With the amount of crappy policies which have passed, I think it affects people more than you think.America has a whole lot of shit going on. They have active voter suppression, clear extremist groups, massive divides which the political landscape here simply doesn't have. Not to mention a ridiculous amount of voter apathy. >Its the people on the fringes who spend all their time engaging in political content that are more susceptible to political messaging because they're seeking it out. This is what I disagree with. Marketing, advertising works on everyone. The people who seek it out will be more susceptible, no doubt, but they're already susceptible. The net difference for these people is 0. My issue is with the non engaged voters. Im arguing that their lack of engagement means that emotional and targeted ads will work, because it's a way of engaging them. I think it's the wrong way. I hope I made myself clearer#I mean we keep using US as an example, but what about other countries?What about Scandinavian nations where income inequality is at a lower point? What about New Zealand? Why is the only comparison to non compulsory voting the USA?I would say we have far more in common with NZ, but we never even discuss that. I don't think we have such stark differences that exist in the US#> With the amount of crappy policies which have passed, I think it affects people more than you think.I dont disagree that its a problem, I disagree with your conclusions about compulsory voting being more susceptible to propaganda than voluntary voting. >  They have active voter suppression, clear extremist groups, massive divides which the political landscape here simply doesn't have.Yeah, turns out voluntary voting didnt stop shit.> I hope I made myself clearerYou're clear, just your arguments arent particularly compelling. #>What about Scandinavian nations where income inequality is at a lower point? Please demonstrate the link between  income inequality and compusory/non-compulsory voting.#Those other countries all have several major parties, we are like the USA. 2 major parties. What occurs there will very likely echo here, and the USA is the disaster scanario of what happens when compulsory voting isnt a thing.#>Yeah, turns out voluntary voting didnt stop shit.But what about the countries where it does work? I mean, it's not like non compulsory voting is only in the USA. I think those issues are due to deeper problems in American society rather than the fact that you don't get in trouble if you don't vote, hence I don't think they're valid comparisons>You're clear, just your arguments arent particularly compelling.Fair enough, we can just leave it there then. Thanks for not getting emotional like some others and actually discussing it#Sure. I'm at work now so I'll link an exert from Wikipedia:>Other perceived advantages to compulsory voting are the stimulation of broader interest politics, as a sort of civil education and political stimulation, which creates a better informed population, although no studies have been undertaken to demonstrate that the populations of Belgium or Australia for instance, where compulsory voting has long existed, are better informed and more politically aware than the populations of New Zealand, France, Canada or the Scandinavian countries, where voting has never been compulsory.>However, a more recent Conference Board of Canada study on World income inequality — also relying on the Gini index — shows that income inequality is lowest in the Scandinavian countries, where compulsory voting has never existed, while Australia, and to a lesser extent Belgium, which strictly enforces their compulsory voting legislation, have a higher income inequality level than a number of other Western countries, such as Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands, where compulsory voting does not exist.And a link to the source:Income Inequality, mid-1990s and late 2000s table. http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/hot-topics/worldinequality.aspxThe fact is, no studies have been undertaken. I wanted to get the discussion rolling on whether it will be good, rather than just looking at America and saying ""yeah but nah""#> I think those issues are due to deeper problems in American society rather than the fact that you don't get in trouble if you don't vote, hence I don't think they're valid comparisonsIm not saying that voluntary voting caused those issues, Im saying they happened despite voluntary voting. Them having a voluntary electoral system rather than a compulsory electoral system did nothing to stop their elections from being influenced. You would therefor have to assert that the US would be worse under compulsory voting to maintain the initial claim without really having any evidence to support the supposition. Compulsory voting means we dont have to deal with the amount of voter suppression that voluntary systems see, I dont think we should ditch it because someone might try to influence our elections. Moving to a voluntary system would not inhibit their attempts. #So ending compulsory voting should result in more equality? How? How do people signal what they want... if they don't?Does that mean that Venezuela became more equal after it ditched compulsory voting? Hardly.#So, are you suggesting that if the USA *had* compulsory voting, there would be less election influence?I was suggesting that for every country like USA, there's a country like Germany or NZ where it works. Every political landscape is unique, and I wanted a perspective on the effect this would have on *Australia*. #For the reasons stated.I believe it creates a better informed population because the people who *do* vote go out of their way to educate themselves.I believe emotional ads work less because the people who will vote that way, most likely won't go to the booths.The only good argument I've heard is that targeted ads will make people NOT vote when they should've.I think there's a lot of factors, such as the nation's stability. I mean Venezuela has accusations of a coup and the leader heading towards a dictatorship - where are the parallels between that and Australia?That's what people aren't understanding - the political landscapes are so different between Australia and Venezuela or USA. I would argue that they're outliers and therefore irrelevant for discussion. Are you suggesting if we ditch compulsory voting we will be in a situation similar to Venezuela? #It would certainly help with their rampant voter suppression.Im not disputing that voluntary voting ""works"". #>Are you suggesting if we ditch compulsory voting we will be in a situation similar to Venezuela?There would be more of an incentive for inequality to head in that direction if political parties aren't held accountable by apathetic voters.I think that the UK which also has a Westminster parliament, shows that.>I believe it creates a better informed population because the people who do vote go out of their way to educate themselves.Rather than a  better informed population because the people need to vote.I'm sorry but your logic is broken.#Right, and if America *had* compulsary voting, and the voter suppression was all but eliminated, do you think there would be more usage of big data manipulation by political parties to compensate? #>Rather than a better informed population because the people need to vote.As I said, there's no studies. Either for or against.The studies that have been undertaken, show that income inequality and voter education could be better in a non compulsory system.The studies against aren't really studies, it's just examples of where it doesn't work well, like Venezuela or USA. I guess North Korea's compulsory voting is a shining example to the world.I don't think the average apathetic voter gives a shit enough to educate themselves. You obviously think they do. I think this is dangerous, because when people are forced to vote who don't want to educate themselves, they vote based on emotion or feelings which increases the effectiveness of propoganda.It's literally he said she said. Nothing wrong with my logic.I guess time will tell. We're just gonna have to agree to disagree. #To compensate for what? I think the usage of these tactics is going to increase regardless of electoral reform because the technology is maturing and its been demonstrated to work. #To compensate for the lack of influence. I suppose what I'm trying to decipher is if voting suppression *was* eliminated, there would be somewhat of an influence void. Would parties who used voting suppression try to create similar ""chaos"" on a larger scale via more data driven methods?From what I understand, you're suggesting that there will be no change because it's already somewhat rampant and it can't get any more rampant on a larger scale. Or, if there will be a change it's because the technology is getting more effective, not because of mandatory/non mandatory voting. #Close. They're already engaging in methods other than traditional voter suppression. Its not like they're holding back on the digital front just because they're also engaging in their more traditional methods. They want to win, so they go all out with whatever tools they have. #Ok, I can appreciate that"

baseball;85urzi;1521568367.0;/r/baseball/comments/85urzi/is_moneyball_the_worst_thing_that_couldve/;Is Moneyball the worst thing that could’ve happened to the A’s?;By Moneyball, I mean the book, not the strategy. Had Michael Lewis never written Moneyball — had Beane never granted access to the A’s’ inner workings to Lewis and allowed the information to be published — the A’s could have continued to corner the sabermetric market for years to come, essentially creating a powerhouse (albeit one akin to a college team, with parts frequently being replaced after 4-5 years due to cost). Sure, the strategy would’ve likely spread across the bigs due to employees getting jobs with other teams, but it seems that Moneyball and its trade secrets accelerated the process. Perhaps the A’s would have been a juggernaut by the time the use of sabermetrics really spread.And what did the A’s miss out on in the process? Surely they’d have received more money from more fans in the stands (though how much is of course open to speculation), more playoff revenue, more merchandise sales, and more attention overall. Hell, maybe the stadium situation would have been solved already, with excitement about the team and goodwill from them winning making parties more amenable to acquiring land for the new park. Maybe Cisco Field would’ve been built downtown, attracting 25,000 fans a game to its convenient location and leading to a big local TV contract, turning the A’s into a big-money team and players for superstar free agents. It worked for the Giants  why not the A’s?This is all speculation, of course. That said, if Billy Beane had decided to keep his strategy and his methods under wraps for a few more years, they would have leaked out in a much slower way, allowing them to corner the big-data market long enough for the A’s to have erased their current longtime ills. And yes, I exaggerate by saying “the worst thing that could’ve happened” — of course there are worse events that could’ve happened, like death or disaster or contraction. That said, what if Moneyball really hurt the A’s’ chances?;I think if the A's truly believed that they could have kept their methods a secret for longer, they wouldn't have allowed Lewis the access to write the book. #Probably not. Paul DePodesta went to the Dodgers in 2004, so it would have gotten out eventually. It still took teams quite some time to adapt, even with the manual.#I have a hard time believing the A's were the only organization in the league that had considered using sabermetrics more heavily in scouting/building. Doubtless they were the leaders at the time, but I'm sure other teams had begun to consider the possibility, even if they were far behind. I can't imagine the A's would've allowed the book to be written if they thought they could keep their methodology a secret.#The implication here is the that the A's were using sabermetrics on the sly and the book exposed that.  This is a false narrative.  Even ignoring that other teams were using analytics at the same time as the A's, they all knew what the A's were doing anyway.  The Red Sox tried to hire Beane, as well as J.P. Ricciardi, before settling on Theo Epstein.  They hired Epstein (and Bill James) before *Moneyball* was published.  Despite what Lewis thinks (he claims that the book ruined the A's competitive advantage), I would be surprised if a single front office guy picked up that book as was surprised by anything in it.  If it did anything, it slightly sped up the adoption of sabermetrical analysis in MLB, due to pressure from fans.There's actually a decent book called *[The Beauty Of Short Hops](https://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Short-Hops-Circumstance-Moneyball/dp/0786462884),* in which they theorize that the A's success had almost nothing to do with their Moneyball approach, and everything to do with having three dominant starting pitchers (Zito, Mulder, and Hudson) at the time Lewis wrote the book.  The authors argue that the A's were almost always at the bottom of the league in runs scored, and that their success was predicated upon star players that everyone knew about (the aforementioned trio of pitchers, along with guys like Miguel Tejada and Eric Chavez), and that the scrubs and nobodies that Beane picked off the scrap heap were a nice story, but ultimately not the primary reason for the team's success.#Nothing that the A's were doing was really a secret. Branch Rickey was doing some similar things in the 40s and 50s. Before the writing of the book there was a significant and growing online community that was very familiar with what was going on. Imo, the biggest drivers in the late '90s were Rob Neyer (his ESPN column was the way in for lots of people), Baseball Prospectus (before the paywall), and Baseball Think Factory (the best mix of popularity and scholarship).Teams weren't adapting to this because old baseball guys thought it was bullshit. The 'Fire Joe Morgan' website was a place where the old v new school fight was crystallized. Schur took time to really pick apart the way that Morgan thought about the game. General Managers and front offices in the 90s were very different than they are now.#Even after the book came out, it still took a decade for most of the rest of the league to catch on. EDIT: The A's win totals in the 4 years after Moneyball came out: 96, 91, 88, 93. The downfall of the early-mid 2000's A's was them not being able to keep up with the big money contracts. #It just gave the movement a name. Guys like Epstein soon emerged, and used some of the same tactics with a budget and found success. #Teams would have noticed at some point. Plus, the A's have still been ahead of the curve in some aspects recently - they developed/targeted fly ball hitters for the 2012-2014 teams (Donaldson and Moss most notably) and Khris Davis a couple years ago. #Would have leaked eventually. After 2002, everyone started tryong to poaching the A's front office. They still do, but on a lesser level because the rich teams can now afford to pay all the best minds in the game. #No, Oakland is the worst thing that could've happened to the A's.#I don’t think money ball gave any particular deep insight into sabermetrics. Plus wasn’t all of bill James books already available #no.#was that book banned in Arizona until 2017?#Sabermetrics were coming either way but the book definitely made some teams notice a bit quicker. Theo Epstein for one was quite pissed the book came out. He felt the publicity made other ownership groups and organizations look to see where they could catchup in the SABR landscape. #Yeah but he was also fired after two years and largely seen as a failure with LA as well, especially compared to relatively traditional Ned Colletti. #I believe the Dodgers had a coach or manager that used a computer to catalog pitcher's starts, but the Dodgers let him go. After that it was Sandy Alderson and then Billy Beane that really began the sabremetrics trend.#That’s fair. And his storied draft ended up falling quite short of expectations as well. #thanks for book description, sounds interesting, ill probably try to read it.#The book sounds interesting, but $30 with no kindle version really grinds my gears. #You make a good point in terms of the community having already existed. I didn’t consider that. That said, I didn’t know how the community was perceived inside front offices. Were Bill James, Rob Neyer, and the rest of them, recognized at all in front offices? If they were, were they viewed as sages, aggressors, or kooks?#If 2012-2014 were more offense-friendly I got a feeling those As teams would have done better#I thought all books were banned in Arizona?#He had the smarts but not the baseball know how to be an effective general manager at the time.#There were at least a dozen teams, maybe more, using computers to store, categorize, and/or analyze baseball stats during the 80s. Not every team took their analyst (usually just one, although I think some teams had larger departments) super seriously, but some certainly did. Earl Weaver was using computers to optimize lineups and study the underpinnings of offense back in the 1970s (if you read about how he felt baseball should be most optimally played, it doesn't sound too different than what you hear from front offices today). The Kirk Gibson walkoff in 1988 was partially made possible due to a Dodger analyst who kept a database containing Eckersley's pitch selection/location and passed along the information. [This](https://miscbaseball.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/sabermetrics-in-1983/) site has some really great examples of advanced metrics in the 1980s if you're interested.#> If they were, were they viewed as sages, aggressors, or kooks?Depends on which front office. A few quietly adopted it into their evaluations, and some rejected it. http://www.firejoemorgan.com/2005/04/ - this should give you an idea of what people thought about this stuff in 2005, in 1999 it was probably even more skewed.#They ran into peak Verlander two years in a row. That'll mess a team up. #Yep, just like Porn in KC#Hey our education may be bad, but we read good#Didn’t he do quite well with the Mets immediately after that? #Those Tiger teams were built to win 5-game series. It was quite annoying#Single handedly ruined the A's post season.#He was their assistant GM — basically the same position he had with the A’s. I suppose he didn’t do that badly there. I wish he was better now, though, as a Browns fan. #Ahh yeah, true. I guess the difference is that he’s not *THE* guy in Oakland/NYM. Maybe he’s just better in a support capacity? #Yeah he ain't a baseball guy

actuary;855qn9;1521312201.0;/r/actuary/comments/855qn9/is_it_time_to_give_up_on_an_actuarial_career/;Is it time to give up on an actuarial career?;"Quick background information:- former math PhD student (ABD)- passed 4 exams (P, FM, MFE, and C)- worked in an industry where I dealt with a large amount data, but I wouldn't classify it as ""big data"",  before it tanked, so I've been teaching for 2 years now- experienced using Excel, VBA, and SQL and can program in C, C++, Java, and MATLABI've been seriously looking for an actuarial job for 2 years and I've had several phone and in-person interviews, but I can't seem to get a job offer.  At this point I'm done putting up my money to take exams.  When is it time to give up on pursuing an actuarial career?";"You are really good on paper which means you should easily be able to get interviews. If you are lacking here, it means there is something wrong with your presentation. Talk to someone professional who is an ass hole and he will tell you what is putting them off.#>  When is it time to give up on pursuing an actuarial career?Only you can really answer that. It sounds like you're having trouble selling your skill set. This isn't actuary-specific problem so much as a life skills problem. No matter what you decide to do, if you want to be successful you need to be able to articulate your skills to people. If you dropped out of the PhD program, you should have a masters. If not, then go back to finish a graduate degree and this time around take advantage of your school's relationships with employers. #Are you restricting yourself to a certain geographic area? #You got this. * Keep your chin up. You have a resume that most EL candidates would kill for. * I would recommend pausing the exams for now. Four is very solid (anything more might make you an expensive EL candidate). * Review your interviewing/interpersonal skills. That's the only area that you could possibly improve (you're very impressive elsewhere).  * Find some folks to do mock interviews with, preferably people that will give you the best honest feedback.  * Your writing seems fine, but in case english isn't your first language, make written & verbal communication a heavy priority. Seriously though - this is not the resume to be going ""I need to give up."" That shouldn't even be a consideration. #i don't know how common this is, but i've heard several managers say they won't consider candidates with a PhD#I don't think passing more exams would help at this point. I don't know how good your interview skills are but that might be an issue in your case otherwise keep searching for an actuarial analyst job till your eyes bleed. If you still can't find anything for several months, find a different career.#Just move into data science and collect your FSA money. There's no point in doing actuarial if you've already invested so much into it with zero return, unless you really like insurance for whatever reason.The exams are just so mind numbingly boring anyways.#As others have said, you have a lot of potentially relevant experience and proven exam success.Reach out to actuaries, not just for jobs, but to network.  Get to know a few actuaries and see if you can get a position out of that.  There are networking opportunities through the SOA - one of which will be at the Life and Annuity Symposium in Baltimore, MD in early May.  If you are nearby, consider registering for the Candidate Connect event.#How old are you?#If you are very interested in actuarial science, keep trying.If you are only interested in money, or you are looking for a technical profession, do not pursue actuarial science. The exams are a false promise of mathenatics/statistics heavy work. You will not use any of this material in 90% of actuarial rolesSeeing you are a former PhD student, I get the feeling that rigorous work is something you are after. If this is the case, there are many better options for you.#Ya, I agree with some others here.  You have to find out what's turning employers away.Have you ever followed up with an employer that interviewed but didn't hire and ask why?  Could be something simple.#You might want to consider an internship first. Exams are great but employers want to see that you are experienced in the actuarial field before they will hire you.#I think you are fairly old and potentially competing in the wrong bucket. Your actuarial credentials are very good for entry level but your age an experience should be of a senior management level, which is why you may have an issue searching for a role. Also, i think the lack of financial industry experience here definitely hurts you. I think you should market yourself more as a specialist, maybe finish your research and try to get in a big bank as an analytics expert etc.. as i think the road for actuarial may be really tough for you#The exams only get harder and more full of useless memorization.Maybe pursue data science.#I can do that.#No, I've applied all over the US.#English is my first language, but occasionally I will fumble over some words.  I think I can ask a couple of people who can work with me of interview skills who can give me some interview feedback.#Don't have a PhD.  I didn't finish my research.#Why not?#I'm going to the Candidate Connect event in Charlotte.  I would have gone to the one in Boston but they had it on Wednesday instead of Monday.#I was waiting for this question.  I'm 39 and I've removed the graduation dates from my resume.#I wouldn't say rigor is something I'm after because I'm passed that part of my life, but I enjoyed my time analyzing spreadsheets and figuring out the problems in the data.#Because somebody with a PhD and no relevant work experience costs too much money.It's different if you have relevant work experience and then return to school to do a PhD. #What i was told is that PhDs tend to have different work habits that are more suited for academia and less for business. Supposedly a lot of them are so used to a slower pace and getting each detail perfectly, rather than being able turn things around and make assumptions as needed when business needs get urgent. #What if that PhD graduate is willing to work for low wages?#That's not how it works.#Why not, I was actually planning on doing a PhD overseas. I have 7 passes with the UK system and no work experience since the country I come from has astronomical unemployment.#That's how it works here. ELs earn same $ regardless of having BS, MS, or Ph.D here. They may get promoted faster if they are good, but we all start the same. (Big P&C Company)#If you are incapable of finding employment with 7 exams in the UK, getting a PhD isn't going to help. There is something severely wrong with your presentation, and if you don't fix it you will continue to remain unemployed even if you do multiple PhDs. #I'm not residing in the UK. I'm in Zimbabwe#Then UK exams are useless to you there.#UK institute is the gold standard IMO, they have the most members and are available in almost every country excluding USA. The current president of the institute and faculty of actuaries is from Zimbabwe. 90+ unemployment will affect actuaries in my country. Most just emigrate after 12 or 15 exemptions. UK exams are not useless to me my nationality is#He is not from Zimbawe, he is from the UK. Had you fully read the interview with him last year, you'd know that your strategy of completing as many exams as possible is an extremely bad idea. http://www.theactuary.com/features/2016/07/qa-mark-hyde-zimbabwe/Just because you've heard people emigrate after 12 or 15 exemptions doesn't mean that they're employed as actuaries in their new country. I have yet to hear of anybody hiring people with no relevant experience just because they cleared 12 exams or have a PhD. Beyond a certain point, you are unhirable in your chosen profession because you've displayed poor decision making skills or have grossly unrealistic expectations about your prospects.#The new president elect is a she, Marjorie Ngwenya. I get what you are saying. I'm gonna stop at 9 and get the actuarial diploma that the IFOA awards at that point. Thereafter I will try to get a non-paying internship anywhere I can. I just recently got my MSc. Hopefully things work out for the best. I'm willing to work for nothing but like I said in Zimbabwe no one is hiring.#Non-paying internships are illegal in most, if not all, Western countries and Australia. No reputable company is going to give you access to their sensitive data for work purposes without compensation. #If you had read my posts I'm in Zimbabwe a country in Southern Africa with the highest unemployment rate ever recorded#And how does that help you? Regardless of the unemployment rate, you've chosen a profession that has very very few people employed in it because of the size and nature of the Zimbabwe economy. You were going to have a hard time working as actuary no matter what the unemployment rate is because the entire country has less than 100 fellows. Internationally, Zimbabwe schools have an extremely poor reputation, and you can't fix that by throwing even more money at professional exams. Although you may not intend it, you are coming across like it's actuarial positions or nothing for you because you've invested so much time and money in the exam process. What I'm telling you is that this is not a successful strategy, in my opinion. No one is going to hand you a job just because you have a bunch of exams completed. #I studied in South Africa and I have a published mathematics paper. I couldn't get the working visa for South Africa so I returned to Zim. I have been applying for various roles since my degree is in mathematics and economics. Data analysis, Economics consultancy,  Actuarial Science, Risk etc. The list is endless.The exams are a bit cheaper for me since the UK has a reduced rate fee structure for unemployed students. I have thought of quitting the actuarial route and trying my luck in academia (overseas since scholarships are bountiful) maybe become a professor but I heard that employment as a lecturer is also tough to break into"
WikiLeaks;85sqji;1521552881.0;/r/WikiLeaks/comments/85sqji/how_obamas_team_used_big_data_to_rally_voters/;How Obama’s Team Used Big Data to Rally Voters (2012 article);"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/509026/how-obamas-team-used-big-data-to-rally-voters/Stumbled across this article from 2012 this morning.  The more I think about it, the more I see what happened this election.  This system of data mining began in 2002 and is increasing its intelligence exponentially.  Those that can turn this data into useful targeting ads (GWB, Obama, Trump) can turn an election upside down or sway it in a manner that traditional means haven't figured out yet.  Data is fluid and changes and the old guard seems to think that a one time cursory look suffices.  My belief is that Clinton saw the data and tried to change it by being the loudest voice in the room rather than conform to what it was saying.  I saw many of my friends (that volunteered for her) try to create a ""facebook"" dialogue about her that came across as fake (fakebook).  They became their own echo chamber and forgot that it was easy to sway supporters...not so easy to sway opposition or those on the fence.How will it be in the future?  The article points out that the DNC purchased cable dvr history and matched it to key players in areas.  I think cable companies will be the next to answer questions.  I think the country talks for a short period about what data is collected about us and I think that this is the new norm.  Nothing will happen.  Elections have evolved before our own eyes.The big question that each candidate or opposition will need to answer from here on out will be:  Has the amount of people talking about my candidate positively changed or has the voice been amplified in an attempt to change the data?>In many respects, analytics had made it possible for the Obama campaign to recapture that style of politics. Though the old guard may have viewed such techniques as a disruptive force in campaigns, they enabled a presidential candidate to view the electorate the way local candidates do: as a collection of people who make up a more perfect union, each of them approachable on his or her terms, their changing levels of support and enthusiasm open to measurement and, thus, to respect. “What that gave us was the ability to run a national presidential campaign the way you’d do a local ward campaign,” Simas says. “You know the people on your block. People have relationships with one another, and you leverage them so you know the way they talk about issues, what they’re discussing at the coffee shop.”>Davidsen, whose previous work had left her intimately familiar with the rich data sets held in set-top boxes, understood that a lot of that data was available in the form of tuner and DVR histories collected by cable providers and then aggregated by research firms. For privacy reasons, however, the information was not available at the individual level. “The hardest thing in media buying right now is the lack of information,” she says.>Davidsen began negotiating to have research firms repackage their data in a form that would permit the campaign to access the individual histories without violating the cable providers’ privacy standards. Under a $350,000 deal she worked out with one company, Rentrak, the campaign provided a list of persuadable voters and their addresses, derived from its microtargeting models, and the company looked for them in the cable providers’ billing files. When a record matched, ­Rentrak would issue it a unique household ID that identified viewing data from a single set-top box but masked any personally identifiable information.";"While much of what you say is valid, I don't think that much can be learned from Hillary's defeat. For too many, the 2016 election was all about rejecting ""business as usual"" in Washington, of which Hillary was a charter member. The Republicans saw it and dumped Jeb (i.e. wanna-be Bush III). The Democrats didn't, cheated Bernie, and kept Hillary (i.e. wanna-be Clinton II). There would have been no way to spin the ex-first lady's / Secretary of State's image in that regard no matter what anybody said on Facebook or anywhere else.#To the only other comment here - dude, you've been shadowbanned.#I agree. Although it wasn’t really the Republican Party that jumped jeb like the democrats screwed Sanders, the voters didn’t vote for him in the primaries. Ironically I think Sanders would probably have beaten trump in the general election.I would hope that since Trump has proven himself to be just as much a part of the establishment as Hillary or jeb or anyone else that all these people are now angry with Trump and won’t vote for him again, or indeed for any establishment candidates. The 2 party stranglehold needs to broken to fix American politics. It’s not real democracy if people only have 2 options that are largely the same thing.#It bugged me to see that 1 comment (but not read it).  I actually thought I was just being dumb.#I don't think that there's any question that Bernie would have beaten Trump if the voters had been allowed to nominate him. I also think that you're 100% right about our current political system. Just as Bernie says, it's an oligarchy, not a democracy."

For those who have or have not seen this paper \([https://www.reddit.com/r/Against\_Astroturfing/comments/84ipa1/\_/dvputaz/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Against_Astroturfing/comments/84ipa1/_/dvputaz/)\), The paper itself is available here:[https://towardsdatascience.com/caveat\-emptor\-computational\-social\-science\-8c2c2d5a7cc5](https://towardsdatascience.com/caveat-emptor-computational-social-science-8c2c2d5a7cc5).  I'd like to make a response and answer any questions from others pertaining to how I collect Reddit data.  The paper itself was nicely done, and although I do not agree with all of the conclusions in the paper, the paper itself was excellent and highlights the necessity for researchers to confirm the integrity of any data that they use for academic purposes.It will take a while for me to properly address the major points in the paper, but I would like to provide an open forum for others to ask questions about the methodology and procedures I use when collecting Reddit data.  I recommend that everyone read the paper and get familiar with the major points within the study.I would like to make a quick response now and say that throughout the process of collecting and publishing these datasets, I have learned a great deal about the ins and outs of Reddit's API as well as better managing the process of big data collection and improving on my efforts to ensure that the data that I collect is as complete as possible given the fact that a lot of the data is constantly changing and evolving through time.  A majority of the data that was missing from the archives was focused on Reddit's earlier years \(2009 and earlier\).  There was also gaps in the data from the Reddit Blackout in July of 2015 that affected some of the data in the archives due to subreddits going private while I was ingesting data.  Once I have time to properly address the concerns in this study, I will follow up with an explanation of what caused these issues and what I learned from the process and how I am now addressing the various issues that caused gaps in the data due to different circumstances.If anyone has questions, please feel free to ask them here and I will do my best to answer as quickly as possible.  I will be following up soon with more details and addressing the various issues that I faced collecting Reddit data.Thank you!**Edit:**  I am reingesting submissions and will be replacing the RS_yyyy-mm files with RS2_yyyy-mm files to signify the second revision.  I will still keep the old files for academic purposes and will place them in an ""old"" directory.  The new submission files will be as complete as possible for the early years of Reddit.  I may just reingest all submissions because Reddit changed their scoring algo and the current submissions have the old adjusted scores.  The new files (RS2) will have the updated scores.  I will still keep the retrieved_on key which gives the epoch time of when I collected the data.  I estimate it will take a couple months to update and reingest all submissions.  I will replace the 2006-2010 period as quickly as possible.  I estimate it will take several weeks to complete that.Since there are far more comments than submissions, I will first work to make sure the early period of Reddit is complete and then decide how to proceed with the later years.  ";"After how many days do you update threads/comments with new vote counts?#From the study,> Missing comment IDs could be attributed to many possible causes. These IDs could be dangling references, publicinformation that for some reason were not returned by Reddit’s systems to Baumgartner’s software at that moment, or**information that was part of a community that had set its discussions to be private**.It seems to me the lion's share of missing data would be part of private communities.  In that case, it wouldn't really be missing data, per se.#I begin ingesting the month as the very end of the month or the beginning of the next month.  I put in the data a key called ""retrieved_on"" that gives the epoch time of when I ingest that particular piece of data (it is present for submission and comment objects).  Usually the vote count for comments and submissions has settled very close to what the score will eventually be archived with.  Reddit archives submissions and comments after six months.  I do not go back and reingest because it would be too expensive using one account's API access limitations.  If I did reingest submissions again, it would probably make sense to do so after it has been archived.  If there is interest in doing this, I may start doing it.#[deleted]#Off topic question, but something I've always wondered about mirrors for open source projects: obviously the infrastructure carries a hefty cost, so what is in it for the owners to host mirrors like yours?#[deleted]#One of the things I would like to do in the future is to rescan missing ids after I do a first pass ingesting.  There are a lot of reasons why ids could be missing -- generally it is due to those comments or submissions being in private subreddits or because they were removed by the original author or a moderator.  I will have to run an analysis on a month's worth of data to see what the average percent of missing ids are for a month, but from what I see while ingesting, that number is most likely under 1%.  It would be extremely helpful if we could use your account to create a scraper and run it to scan for the missing ids to make sure that the ids weren't missing due to a transient error.  I am limited to asking for 100 ids per second on the main ingest account, but having a second account to do a second scan would help tremendously.  I don't anticipate that we would find many ids after a second pass, but even finding a couple hundred would help make the data as complete as possible.  Is that something you would be willing to assist with?  Also, I am going to create a Python script to scan the monthly  daily dumps and print out some statistics on the data.  I'll put in some flags to alert for situations like a large sequential block of missing data, etc.  I'll make that script available to the public so that researchers can run the script to verify sha256sums for the data and also to check for any abnormalities in the dataset.#Interesting. Thanks for the insight, and helping out some of these projects. "

They've strategically positioned themselves to be a part of the ATA association for trucking, which have some very huge partners (FedEx,UPS to name a few....plus major logistic companies). The team has positioned themselves in a strategic niche, a new implementation of ELD (eletronic data mandate) - essentially devices for electronic logging, is now mandatory to ALL truckers starting December 2019. I've been slowly watching ARY and the team, and appreciate the use-case their applying ARY and the network to.A nice neutral article regarding ARY, its network, use-cases, and development. [Block Array (ARY) Analysis – Blockchain In Trucking And Supply Chain](https://bitshouts.com/block-array-ary-analysis/)#I’ve been slowly accumulating to buy a node (this has been super under the radar and I wasn’t sure if others really knew about it). Thankfully prices have been low enough that a masternode is incredibly affordable.  I imagine that will likely change after the announcement, but who knows. #I looked at ARY very briefly  a month or so ago, but it seemed like they were a long way out on their roadmap. And the team was pretty small. I didn’t buy any because I felt like the price was a bit high for where it was at. It’s good to see updates and I’ll take another look into it. ERC20 token? Any plans for their own chain?#Show me the roadmap #nice cant wait for april!#US based and SEC compliance is probably one of the most important features of this token. Very excited to watch Ary develop as a companyand product, I am hopeful that this is one crypto that will survive and thrive through the coming government regulations.#The will be two tiers and the only figure given is both will be under 50K tokens #7500 for heartbeat, 22000 for secondary, 50k for primary #Yes#Wish we had more info about that already.  want to know if I need to buy more before the MN announcement. #The ary team is releasing that info in like 10 minutes from now

China and Russia have similar geopolitical interests and were soft partners during the Cold War. Russia also learned some of its active measures techniques having ruled for centuries certain areas of northern Asia and sharing a border. China is way better at active measures given it nearly invented them with Sun Tzu’s, “Art of War” in 500 BC. My educated guess is that China understands the populist rise in the West. It is in their interest to promote anti-democratic sentiments and are likely involved with Russia and others to discredit western democracy and egalitarianism. China will be much better at doing this under cover and we will likely not have the full picture. See the recent scandal that rocked 60 admirals in the Navy via Fat Lenard and Asia.

AskFeminists;85xg9l;1521588178.0;/r/AskFeminists/comments/85xg9l/how_important_do_you_believe_big_data_was_in_the/;How important do you believe “Big Data” was in the radicalization of anti-feminist sentiment? (And others);I’ve been thinking on this one since the Channel 4 reports on Cambridge Analytica began rolling out.  If you haven’t seen them thus far, they are pretty essential to understanding the scope of what’s happened.  I would start [here](https://youtu.be/mpbeOCKZFfQ) to get directly to how this affects us, but I’ll give a brief layperson’s summary below (might not be perfectly detailed or accurate, but I myself am a layman in this context):Per Channel 4’s investigation, Cambridge Analytica, a corporate data analytics and communications company, collected data from Facebook on over 50 million people, ranging from political views and activity, personality traits, demographics data, and possibly even psychological indicators.  (Zuckerberg and Facebook’s influence isn’t known, but it’s assumed that the data was given willingly.)From there, Cambridge Analytica paired with several other organizations and actors in order to engage in psychographics, or what could best be described as psy-ops, using the American election as an example:-	Steve Bannon, owner of Brietbart and former board member of Cambridge Analytica (left to join the Trump campaign), who used Brietbart to create and disseminate data-driven fake news for the purpose of stoking and aggravating fears of right-leaning voters-	Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, at this point regarded as part of Russia’s disinformation arm, to release slow leaks targeted at aggravating similar right-wing sentiments and undermining the credibility of Trump’s opposition-	Facebook, using hyper-targeted advertisements and ‘suggested’ stories to create an individualized, fabricated, often fake news feed driven by data collected from Facebook-	Russian troll farms, which received the same Facebook analytics data Cambridge Analytica received, to disseminate fake news and disinformation, derail discussion, and act as bad-faith agitators on Facebook, Twitter, and RedditPer campaign finance sunshine laws, we know that the Trump campaign, as well as the Mercer family and other billionaire donors, paid Cambridge Analytica tens of millions of dollars through Trump’s campaign and through Super PACs.  We also know Trump (& team) and the Mercers have met directly  Trump and Cambridge Analytica have met directly  the Mercers and Cambridge Analytica have spoken directly  and both the Trump campaign and the Mercers have reached out to Assange to amplify WiliLeaks’ message.  We do not know how much, if any, Putin and other Russian oligarchs have paid to Cambridge Analytica (they are not affected by campaign finance laws as the American donors are).We also know Cambridge Analytica played a similar role, likely with many of the same actors, in the #Brexit campaign.  Alexander Nix, head of Cambridge Analytica, has boasted about engaging in over 200 such campaigns worldwide.Okay, with all that in mind, my questions:**How significant do you feel “Big Data” (hyper-targeted disinformation, fake news, psy-ops campaigns, Astroturfing) is in aggravating and radicalizing anti-feminist sentiments, either as a campaign goal or a corollary to other campaign goals?**  Do you believe antipathy towards feminism has been drummed up or even fabricated in some cases to act as a convenient wedge issue, and to drive interest and voter engagement up on the other side?  Do you believe these sentiments would have fostered organically at the rate they have, or even at all, if not for the presence of bad actors and disinformation acting with coordination on a multinational scale?**How does this affect the culpability of anti-feminists who have been engaged in this manner?**  There is a saying that “if you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product.”  In this case, how culpable is the “product” for their engagement as a response to this campaign?  Yes, much of what happened was Cambridge Analytica (and related actors) playing on existing fears and biases, and propaganda is nothing new as a concept, but it was also done this time in such an intrusive way as to literally reshape each targeted person’s reality to fit their agenda.  In a very real way, the media we consume shapes our reality, and the media these people consumed—the targeted “news” stories pushed to them, the hyper-targeted advertisements and ‘suggested’ filters, the hijacking of groups and astroturfing within their social networks—turned their reality into a fundamentally different one at all levels.  Obviously, culpability for one’s own actions falls to them, but at what point does the blame for the belief which informs that action fall to the bad-faith actors who have constructed a false social reality around these “products”?**What do we do about it?** Feminism is in at least some part about messaging and outreach, as dedicated feminists alone cannot achieve all their goals in a timely fashion: there needs to be some coalition-building and broader community engagement to achieve many broader goals.  Some people may need to be dragged kicking and screaming into the achievement of these goals, but that’s the case for all progressive movements.  But if there are potentially tens of millions of people whose worldviews are being shaped by propaganda personalized to exploit *their* weaknesses—if their perceptions are being carefully constructed around them by bad faith actors—if their *realities* are different from ours as a result—how reachable are these people, really?  And if these methods are successful and pervasive enough to force people to the margins on a large enough scale to drive policy and turn elections, what can we do about it?  What *should* be done about it?;"May I suggest also asking other subreddits like /r/Anarchism, /r/Socialism, or any leftist subreddit in general?There’s some tech-anarchist subreddits too but I forget them at the moment.#Julian Assange is a dumbass, no doubt about it. But labeling his tragic little soap operas ""part of Russia’s disinformation arm"" is as dumb as Assange himself. What you've happened to discover is, as we've always known, the real subversive-right has always been homegrown: Bannon, Breitbart, the Mercers, the Kochs, Fox News, Donald Trump, Project Veritas, the CIA, Peter Thiel, and so many other deplorables. That they may find common cause with petty little oligarchs or sad little Australians should not let us get distracted that this is a very American problem, with very American roots. (Is it not Facebooks complete dedication to extracting advertising dollars from any source the *cause* to which Cambridge Analytica put their big data to real effect?)#I could write more but I’m tired, so I’m just gonna say for now “duh” of course they’re gonna drum up anti-feminist support. That’s what right wing people do.Are the anti-feminists culpable? Complicit I think is a better word that acknowledges patriarchy is the responsible party that has coerced these vulnerable men.Cambridge Analytica needs to be destroyed.I’m excited to hear what other people here have to say though :)#[removed]#Hey, you posted twice, so I’m going to respond once and [link your other post for reference](https://reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/85xg9l/_/dw18n9e/?context=1), if that’s okay with you.I didn’t post to a leftist or tech sub for three reasons:1) I assumed these discussions would happen in those subs already, and wouldn’t necessarily be better off spurred along by an outsider, whereas I regularly post here.2) I know enough left-leaning political analysts, low-level politicians, and career software people (including infosec) outside of Reddit to be able to have candid discussions on the matter in person, on the phone, etc.  Kind of selfish of me, but I don’t need Reddit to have those discussions.3) I’m of the mind, and have been for years, that the single greatest divide in privilege and power dynamics is that of economic class, and that most other divides (such as those of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc) are created, both by creating divisions in privilege and by fostering out-group hatred, by the elite economic classes in order to get people to focus on those divisions instead of on the growing inequalities in economic classes, so that they may continue to accumulate and protect their wealth uninhibited.  On a socialist sub, the answer to this is very straightforward: *“they did these things to defeat us because we are their direct opposition, and our economic system directly threatens their margins and their status as economic elites.”*  This is less the case for feminism, as the advancement of feminist goals in liberal feminism doesn’t necessarily involve upending the power structures they directly benefit from, but working within them (obviously, this is not the case for socialist feminism, radical feminism et al., but those would receive the same straightforward answer), and yet these methods have very likely been used to radicalize anti-feminism (as they have race) in order to advance their economic goals.  It’s not the focus of their economic goals, but they positioned themselves as direct enemies anyway, which is a more complex dynamic, and one I’d like to discuss because I’m not sure how to navigate it going forward, with how far it’s actually gone in the Internet age.I don’t know if complicit beat describes my feelings on the matter.  It implies a level of agency and contribution to the conspiracy that I don’t think all of them had.  The way propaganda works in this new model is like socialization on crack, but there is also a coercive element to it as well.  But, it’s definitely a better word than culpable, and I can’t think of a better one, so I’ll use that going forward.I agree Cambridge Analytica needs to be dissolved over this, but I wonder what will happen if it does.  Another Cambridge Analytica will just pop up in their place unless permanent, concrete legislative action is taken to render the strategies they’ve used illegal, and then enforce that legislation.  In the meantime, we need to operate within the space we’re in, and that includes a world where CA’s strategies are both legal and prevalent, and I’m not sure how to do that, and haven’t been for a long time.#>	Julian Assange is a dumbass, no doubt about it. But labeling his tragic little soap operas “part of Russia’s disinformation arm” is as dumb as Assange himself. With respect—it’s already known that Russian hackers released information directly to WikiLeaks for timed and scheduled releases, and several actors (including Trump’s campaign, the Mercers, and Russian actors) worked both to order those releases and boost Assange’s signal.  That he’s a dumbass doesn’t change this fact  a tool does, by definition, have its use.Edit:>	What you’ve happened to discover is, as we’ve always knownI want to clarify: much of this has been known, by myself and most anyone with at least an ear above-ground, for years now.  You are certainly aware as well.  What is new is our knowledge of the extent of cooperation and their actions, in concrete terms.  Now that we have a more exact picture of how these parts all connect for these movements, I want to extrapolate to how it affects or has affected other movements, the degree of success, what to do next.#The CIA is a subversive right wing radical organization? #>	This sounds like a conspiracy theory.You’re welcome to think that, but in the four days since the series started airing, [Cambridge Analytica’s CEO was suspended over things he said in interviews throughout the series](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/03/20/politics/alexander-nix-cambridge-analytica/index.html), [Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned by UK parliament to address the data leak](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-43474760), and [Facebook lost $50 billion in market value this week over the controversy](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/20/news/companies/facebook-stock-price-mark-zuckerberg/index.html), so enough credible people (both involved in the controversy and otherwise) believe it is actionable enough to affect change.I think, if you don’t believe there is significant deal of truth in this, you haven’t watched the videos, as many of the claims made against Cambridge Analytica involve the words of actors within Cambridge Analytica itself.E: The rest makes it pretty clear you’re violating rule 1, so it’s not really worth addressing.#Read the sidebar bro. #Yeah, based on both this post and your comments elsewhere, I cannot justify you as either (currently) being a feminist or putting forth a feminist perspective, so as was hinted to you before, I’m taking this comment down. #I really wish I wasn’t still exhausted from jetlag, it’s truly an interesting discussion.Again I can only muster a brief reply.I didn’t intend to be the most upvoted comment here, I feel like my directing you to other subs unfortunately blunted conversation here.

statistics;88mhqw;1522537798.0;/r/statistics/comments/88mhqw/has_anyone_moved_from_statistics_to_ai_is_it_even/;Has anyone moved from statistics to AI? Is it even readable?;Hi, I'm a biostatistician. I work in clinical trials on sample calculations, analysis, maybe simulations once in a while.   I see lots of interesting new developments in machine learning. And two things come to mind :  -My job is probably going to be swallowed by big data analysis. *Not necessarily AI taking over my job, just RCT/observational studies becoming obsolete compared to the use of huge datasets and machine learning analysis methods*. Eg. **Google Verily, using technology and masses of data to identify positive health outcomes**. I imagine this will affect other stats fields also, not just medical.     -It looks very exciting, compared to what I'm doing.      As statisticians, are we able to transition into big data and machine learning? The skillset seems entirely different.;"So, as a statistician did you look carefully into what is called by ""machine learning"" method-wise? Fancy terminology aside how different it is from methods you regularly use? There was this thourougly unscientific poll somewhere asking ""data scientists"" what method they use the most. I belive 70% of them proudly use linear regression. So, i think you will be fine.#Here's the thing: what you're calling ""machine learning"" (deep neural nets/recurrent nets/convolutional nets) don't do anything particularly special besides being able to find patterns in data that may or may not correspond to real, biological phenomena. They take an enormous amount of data and although they can find relationships that a person wouldn't, those findings don't given you any actual mechanistic understanding. There are and always will be instances in which your sample size is relatively small and yet you must try to theorize and use inference to create testable hypotheses about a certain situation. Machine learning algorithms not only don't possess ""common sense"" they also don't possess ""expert sense"" whereas the bioinformatician does because they have what's called ""domain knowledge. A deep neural network is totally unconstrained by what is reasonable or not because it possesses no ""mental framework"" to constrain it. Imagine that you feed a neural network a huge amount genetic data from a diversity of human populations and try to have it predict susceptibility to malarial infection risk. It'll pick out certain alleles associated with non-equitorial peoples but it takes an epidemiologist/bioinformatician to be able to conclude ""well of course this is true because malaria and their vectors have territorial overlap at the equator"". The neural net has given you nothing in terms of discovering what mutations confer malarial resistance because all it does is pattern match and has no domain knowledge or mental framework. Now consider the case of the epidemiologist/bioinformatician that has the skills to wield a neural network appropriately and gives it the same data constrained only to equitorial populations where malaria is known to be prevalent. He/She finds that the mutations associated with certain anemias and thalassemias confer resistance but perhaps also a combination of mutations in IgG proteins not noted in the literature and provides researchers with a new target of investigation. You should notice that these conclusions could have possibly been reached with a ""simpler"" method such as those used in GWAS.Neural networks may be powerful but they are rarely better than traditional methods. It's often smarter and more interpretable/actionable to use PCA/regression/clustering before trying a network. Using a neural network largely throws away everything we've learned in a domain of science in favor of sheer computational power. Sometimes this is appropriate (because we may know little about a data set) but in most instances it is not.#I was a clinical trials biostatistician and recently (a little over a year ago) moved into a role as a ""big data"" statistician that works on health outcomes. once of the biggest things is that you have to live with the fact that you do not have as much accuracy with big data as you get with randomized clinical trials. Ideally the bigger your data the less you have to sweat the small stuff. One of the biggest issues we have is that most people do not go to the doctors unless they are not well. Because of this, we will always have a biased control group (yes, even with ICD10 codes which have their own biases.) Big data allows some wonderful for some retrospective, observations (possibly), perspective (somewhat) ways to find new outcomes and medical insights, but I  believe the gold standard will always be some form of a randomized clinical trial. At least for the near future. Good luck trying to defend a new drug to the FDA without a few Phase 2-3 randomized control trials. As for the transition:Coming from classical statistics I was always worried machine learning was ""very complex"" and would take me a long time to learn. Being a statistician, learning all the caveats and assumptions is very important to me and a lot of the current machine learning articles online seem to gloss over the assumptions/ theory for application (*cough *cough Kutner). Once you look into to neural networks/ Markov chains the statistics aren't as difficult as it is hyped up to be. In fact, from that I have seen, a lot of machine learning uses basic statistical methods coupled with a pretty straightforward computer algorithm.#There's actually a fairly big overlap. There are some technologies in the AI area that are quite different from what you're used to, the jargon is quite different (and to some extent likely to cause confusion with the pre-existing equivalents in statistics, where terms are used to mean something else). Some of the mathematics is different too and not all of it is easy, but by and large if you have a pretty broad knowledge of statistics and some programming and  mathematics a fair amount of the skills will carry over, and you'll just have to learn the parts that are unfamiliar. In some areas the overlap is substantial, in others it's less so (e.g. in vision-related AI, where it's nearly all neural nets, considerably less, but in areas related to prediciton or classification you're usually solving a subset of the same problems statisticians were decades ago, just on much larger data sets than were typically practical to obtain or deal with -- and then the skill sets have more overlap).[One issue with big data that's often greatly underappreciated is that bias (and in some situations, therefore, generalizability) tends to dominate variance. If your data doesn't look like what you want to make conclusions about, it may not be very useful because of this unrepresentativeness. Some well known ""big data"" statistical studies of decades long past had this very problem.]Sometimes the AI people end up de-emphasising the overlap -- in some cases partly from ignorance and in other cases partly from wanting to look new and different (it's hard to sell people on those high salaries if it sounds too much like the statistics you're already paying less for).#I am a clinical pharmacologist so not qualified to answer per se.  In medicine and clinical trials, domain knowledge is fairly important.  Further, drug developers tend to be pretty conservative.  As such, I believe biostats folks who know AI will be the innovators.  AI folks who learn clinical trials will not be as well positioned.As others have mentioned, a lot of ""machine learning"" is regression.  Big whoop. Right now, drug development is too segmented.  Phase II protocols are laid out before MAD studies are completed.  Radiolabeled studies are mega informative, but subsequent PK models don't use any priors. As such: I think adaptive clinical trials will get some momentum.  After that, bayesian adaptive models. #The classical skills of statisticians are especially important in deflating the hype of AI. Deep learning is useful, and the ""best"" tool for a particular set of problems (stuff like computer vision), but it is no panacea and similarly ""big data"" does not hold all the answers. Getting a lot of data because it is available is just one more form of convenience sampling and it will always come back to bite you in the ass if you are not careful. So, no, feeding big data to a deep learning algorithm will not solve all medical problems nor will it make RCTs or observational studies obsolete. It could do better than existing methods for some particular problems for sure but as a new tool, it's not the kind that make all the previous ones obsolete. And as proof, I am joining a huge tech company that knows all about AI, yet they are hiring me for my *classical* statistical skills, as design of experiment is becoming new again in light of the fact that big data often falls into convenience sampling and will not automatically answer the business questions one has. Once the hype of early successes of AI dies down in light of diminishing returns, its place among all the possible tools one can use will become better understood, and make new room for solid statistical training. That said, I would encourage anyone with solid statistical training to learn at least a bit of the machine learning approaches to data science, because those are all the rage, useful tools in many regards, and sometimes in desperate need of good statistical expertise in terms of sampling and design of experiment.#Oops, my phone changed feasable to readable. #You might already be qualified. I think there is a healthy amount of crossover. Your points are fair. The hard part for statisticians might be the programming involved. As a former software dev going into DS, math & stats are the hard part for me whereas I think many of my classmates aren't too comfortable with programming. The point is, there is some trade-off here and having a well-rounded skillset is usually the golden ticket. #I disagree that the Randomized double-blinded clinical trials will ever give away to big data type of AI learning. New treatments will always need some type of human experimentation , and the gold standard will always be randomized trials. Clinical trials are expensive but necessary . What the health care data can show is already shaped by prevailing clinical practice , and in the foreseeable future that is always going to be largely influenced by the professionals . You can’t find something that contradicts the current practice based on data collected using the current practice.  #Hi I basically did the switch from stats ( econometrics ) to ML. My TL DR is yes the switch is possible and ""real"" stats people in the ML commuity are relatively rare and can be very valuable. In my opinion the best test to see if you are ""fit"" is to get the book ""Elements of Statistical Learning"" and skim some chapters. (its free online) #Ironically, I would be VERY weary of a data scientist handling anything related to making strong assertions on causality. Google Flu predictions worked really well until it stopped working....#Your first question really hits the nail on the head. People just get caught up in the buzz words and don't actually understand what's going on. I can't stand it.#Can we have a link to these survey results?#So true, I think people get way too caught up in the terminology. I'm in a stats grad program now and machine learning is thoroughly entrenched in our coursework, seminars, etc, seen more of a sub-area. You can just go to a stats conference to see the many, many, talks on it, I think big data and machine learning are already a part of the field so transitioning isn't really an issue.#machine learning usually refers to random forests and neural networks#I suggest you make this the first line of your textpost. Who's going to see it down here?#The [kaggle community survey](https://www.kaggle.com/surveys/2017) had ~60% using logistic regression.#this is how it is usually used by a fairly narrow group of professionals, who (hopefully) also understand a long list of method limitations. Unfortunately, at the level of management it is used as a buzzword with little context as is "" We will leverage machine learning technology to improve workforce productivity ..... #√#If you use the drop down to the title of data scientist, logistic regression is at 74%. Interestingly enough, if you scroll to the title of computer scientist, you will see that ""neural networks"" are the highest at 55%#Oh okay, in my field management is fairly clued-in. Do you work in tech?#Which makes sense given how hot deep learning is right now. And neural nets are still closely tied to regression, just more complex functions (layers) thrown in. "
statistics;88obry;1522556637.0;/r/statistics/comments/88obry/assignments_for_statistical_literacy_big_data_in/;Assignments for statistical literacy: Big Data in Healthcare, Data and the Law, Manual Writing;"This semester, I've been trying a lot of new assignments to encourage reading and writing of statistical literature as part of a new class and in preparation for a course pack I am publishing soon. Here are two of the reading assignments and one of writing exercises that I tried this semester: ""Data and the Law"", ""Big Data in Healthcare"", and an exercise on writing good statistical instructions.All of the required reading is open access. 1. ""Data and the Law"" reading assignment, in which we look at some of the complications of copyright, scientific facts, and compilations.This reading assignment pertains to “Data and the law: Beyond the sweat of the brow. Who owns published data? And what is data?” by Gerald van Belle and Leslie Ruiter, available at https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2014.00737.xQ1) What are some things that the US Copyright Act denies protection to? Name at least three.Q2) When was it ruled that telephone numbers were not subject to copyright?Q3) Say that you wanted to use the information in Table 1 in your own publication. Give two other ways that Table 1 could be changed in order to meet the 'modicum of originality' requirement.Q4) What are the restrictions, if any, on making a graph using someone else's data?Q5) Which of the three, EU, USA, and Canada is the most restrictive on copyright law pertaining to data? Which is the least?2. ""Big Data and Healthcare"" reading assignment, in which we look at some of the ways in which big data is changing how hospitals operate.The following 8 questions can be answered by reading the article “Big data analytics in healthcare: promise and potential” by Wullianallur Raghupathi and Viju Raghupathi  in Health Information Science and Systems 2014, 2:3Available at: http://www.hissjournal.com/content/2/1/3Q1) What is more difficult in working with big data in healthcare? Why?Q2) Give two examples of how big data analytics can lead to improved outcomes.Q3) What are some developments or outcomes that can be predicted with big data?Q4) What are the four V's of big data, pertaining to analytics in healthcare?Q5) Give an example of a future application of real-time data.Q6) Name three platform/tool options for conducting big data analytics?Q7) What are the four steps of the methodology of big data analytics?Q8) How did twitter tracking compare to official reports of cholera in Haiti in 2010?3. ""Writing Instructional Material"" assignment, in which we try to describe the steps for performing a standard analysis.In-Class Exercise: Write instructions for someone wishing to make a linear regression model and make some additional predictions from that model. Assume that the user has access to software like R, and has experience with it. Also assume that they don't know which statistics tests and plots are useful.Yours should be about 200 words. The following example is more than 400 words, but shows a lot of what you could run into.Example: Instructions for performing a one-way ANOVA, including diagnostics and post-hoc analysis.1. Check if you data is of the proper type. The response/dependent variable should be a numerical quantity, and the explanatory/independent variable should be a categorical or grouping variable. If one of these isn't true, then ANOVA is not the analysis you want.2. Check the extent of any missing data, if any. If there is some, you may want to remove cases with any missing data, or you may want to impute before continuing. Note that reliable imputation of the group or category may be impossible. Similar considerations may be needed for very small groups.3. Check the residuals of the model from lm() for normality. Do this either by histogram, Q-Qplot, or a formal hypothesis test like Shapiro-Wilks or Anderson-Darling. If there is strong evidence of non-normality, follow the non-parametric route. Otherwise, follow the parametric route.Parametric route4. Use the lm() command to build a model of 'response ~ explanatory', and save that model. Use the anova() command on the saved model to get an anova table.5. The p-value on the right of the ANOVA table is result of testing the hypothesis that all of the group means are equal. If this is small (smaller than some arbitrarily pre-selected alpha, such as 0.05), then continue to the post-hoc test in step 6.6. Perform a Tukey test with the TukeyHSD() command. The differences in each pair of means will be shown in the output. The p-values for group differences are automatically adjusted to the number of groups and pairwise comparisons you have. The null hypotheses being tested in each case is if those two group means in the pair are equal. Any small p-values suggest 'honestly significant' differences between the means.Non-Parametric route4. Perform a Krusal-Walls test (a non-parametric ANOVA) on the data by using the kruskal.test() on 'response ~ explanatory' model. The null hypothesis being tested here is if the mean RANK of each group is the same.5. The p-value given with the Krusal-Walls test indicates if there are any significant differences in the RANK mean of the groups. If this is small (smaller than some arbitrarily pre-selected alpha, such as 0.05), then continue to the post-hoc test in step 6.6. Perform a Wilcoxon test on each pair of means and acquire a p-value for each. Compute an adjusted alpha from you initial family-wide alpha and a multiple testing adjustment such as the Bonferroni, Sidak correction. Alternatively, perform a non-parametric post-hoc test such as a Dunn's Test.Blog mirror: http://www.stats-et-al.com/2018/03/assignments-for-statistical-literacy.html";"Always is good to remember good practice when analysing data.

Let's talk about things that can get you identified relatively easily and how to avoid ending up naked. *Your handle* - That nick-name you use for Twitter, YouTube, Skype, Reddit or any other social media service. A simple cross reference can bring visitors to all your places on the internet with that same handle. Using a completely separate handle on /r/exjw should give you some buffer space as long as you don't divulge too much other information. *Email or Phone* - While this should be obvious, any email address or phone number you own can be popped into Facebook, or any big data index of people and find you fast. Don't use them around people you don't trust.*Congregation* - Don't talk about what congregation you go/went to if you need anonymity. *State, City, Geography or address* - It's very simple to look people up by their location.  Members of a household can be discovered with their address. Conventions or assemblies you went to? What circuit you're in? All geographical markers for finding you. Don't use specific locations or places if anonymity is important to you. *Date of Birth, Age* - Your DOB and first name can practically identify you.  What happens at the doctor to verify your identity? They ask your DOB. ""John"" with a specific birthday in a specific state can be nearly enough to find someone.*Photos* - Metadata in photos can be used to find a location. Depending on what they are, facial recognition on Facebook could just tag you if your privacy settings aren't configured right.  Be mindful of this. Use Imgur? What account is it attached to when posting to the sub? Is it one that can be back traced to a real person?I hope this helps you when behaving anonymously on the internet. Separate yourself from yourself if you don't want to be found.  If you want people to look you up and say hello, by all means, make it easy as well.  Be kind to each other.  *Apostate hugs* ";"Thank you for these timely reminders lol#I appreciate the information given here, it makes perfect sense. However what if your trying to actually meet up with some people you met here after talking for some time? I've definitely been trying to speak to new people here and hopefully become real friends. I've met quite a few actually and we talk regularly no problem 😅#Great reminders. Remember that a close friend or family member might not need as many clues to associate you with your username as a stranger.#Thank you. Good advise.  Guess we should be cautious of meet-ups too! Or people asking us to disclose our location.... PS what is the best way to meet-up without ""outing yourself"" - in case it is a setup. I guess that is a hard question to answer if there are so many lurkers here! #Thank you. This is an excellent post, and I have saved it to add to our wiki. I will be pointing people to this frequently. #There is no issue if you understand what the consequences are. That's not exactly the point of my post.  The point is that there are many ways to find a person's identity online. Handles, initials, accounts, and other pieces that can be put together.  If you are concerned about someone exposing you, there is a sense of due diligence to keep your information private, and separate. We had a very explosive situation where someone hastily tossed up someone's ""real name"" on the sub. Very easy to find. Meet up with people. Support each other.  Know the risks and behave accordingly. #This is a good point to add. Telling that story about your life could land you in a tough situation, if someone else read it that actually knows you.  Is it unlikely your PIMI family will be reading on /r/exjw? That is probably something to consider.  Leaving out most of the details and making things a bit more ambiguous would be appropriate. Edit: spelling#Calculated risk.  History of the person, their posts, what they say, and also what they think. There are ways to vet people, and alleviate some of that risk. Currently, I know nearly no exjws in person. #Thanks. I hope it helps. #Super! Thanks for clarifying this for me, i now have a better understanding of what you meant 😊😊#Right on. Meeting in person is not really in scope here. This is all about protecting your privacy and anonymity.  You give that up when meeting people, obviously. "

TheHandmaidsTale;87u6j7;1522260956.0;/r/TheHandmaidsTale/comments/87u6j7/speculation_how_gilead_might_have_tracked_down/;Speculation: how Gilead might have tracked down all the fertile women, criminals, and LGBT folks;I came across [this](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/27/597279596/they-don-t-care-whistleblower-says-cambridge-analytica-seeks-to-undermine-democr) NPR article this morning, right around when the new trailer was posted for S2. With all this stuff coming out about data mining and privacy rights, it seems to answer a question I (and many others, it seems) have wondered about Gilead's rise to power. How did they determine who was LGBT, fertile, a criminal (in their Biblical terms), and how to find them? The sheer logistics involved sounded like a nightmare to me. Okay, so Gilead isn't exactly touting being technologically advanced, if anything they're for traditional values. But wouldn't it be so typical of a fascist state to say one thing and do the opposite behind closed doors? If Gilead was to work, there needed to be a pretty solid network of people who were on board in key industries...think tech and big data. If they had access to data on Americans collected via browsing habits, online transactions, location, social media activity, they could know a lot about most people. Hell, they could track down fertile women just by looking at their spending habits over the past 10 years -- did they buy any baby supplies? Contraception? They could bust people for being LGBT by looking at dating apps, facebook posts...there's a lot of possibilities.;"I think that’s believable we know at the higher ups use laptops. It’s believable that they still heavily use technology. I assumed they tracked down fertility through medical records. Regarding lgbt they control the government. They nsa shit. #Well considering Facebook straight sells our data to just about anyone. It would be interesting if they had been able to have a storyline about Gilead buying databases of social media use.#""Gott mit uns"" -- The Nazi SS used to put that on their belt buckles.  Translates as ""God with us"".#Social media, dating apps grindr, scruff etc, even google search data is extremely revealing.#Yep,Watching the show I was thinking exactly this is how they were able to classify large groups of people.I've been trying to tell people that data privacy is something we should all be concerned about for years now so this article doesn't surprise me. I am actually kind of glad this Cambridge Analytica scandal happened. Whenever I tried to explain why privacy and data collection was important, I'd always be met with a big shrug, a ""so what"" and a ""things could not really get that bad here"". Now people are starting to see the real life consequences of extensive data collection and the huge amount of power it gives a person or an organization. I actually can't believe this Cambridge Analytica is even a scandal in the first place. I remember reading an article about how their extensive power in political campaigns right after the election in 2016 (if I find the link I'll post it) and one of the biggest concerns talked about was the ability for companies to sell your data to some ""trusted partner"" and that trusted partner having free reign to sell it to whoever they want for whatever they want.House of Cards even had political candidates targeting voters by their online data as a plotline 2 years before the 2016 election.In the end what scares me isn't just that Gilead would be able to efficiently be able to implement a system like this by buying data from extensive data collection agencies alone, but that with surveillance laws and technologies like biometrics combined with AI algorithms as advanced as they are today, an underground movement like May Day might not be able to exist. A state like Gilead if using these type of technologies, could virtually stay forever if there is no intervention from foreign powers.This is a good 5 minutes video showing China as an example of this today.https://www.wsj.com/video/life-inside-chinas-total-surveillance-state/CE86DA19-D55D-4F12-AC6A-3B2A573492CF.htmlThe documentary Terms and Conditions Apply was released in 2013 and was all about how companies like Facebook, Google LinkedIn etc... are selling data to third parties.Margaret Atwood was on of the interviewees.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_and_Conditions_May_ApplyThis is a whole documentary about the technologies the UK uses everyday to surveil mass populations of people and the advantages and disadvantages:https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/science-surveillance/#Do you want to simplify reading news? My advice is to use the Feedster app. All the news from social networks and other sources in one place, fresh interface and easy to use. Download here: [thefeedster.com](http://thefeedster.com)#In the series, they froze bank accounts of women. They used demographics to do this. So they could have taken anything they could find about you. For instance, they knew june married a divorced man by looking up public documents. OR, when they kidnapped escaping women, or women in general, they could have just interrogated it out of them. Both methods work. #Yeah you're right, they do have those capabilities. I guess I was thinking more about gilead before they had solid access to institutions like the NSA, when the ""movement"" was growing. In one flashback iirc Fred mentions to Serena some of the conspirators are being followed by the FBI...it seems like they maybe had to be sneaky for a bit#For sure. But after the coup, they presumably took control of both agencies. I'm assuming that's when they started going after LGBT people, criminals, etc.By the way, I would be really interested to see just how the SoJ pulled off the coup. I'm assuming that they already had members in positions of power before the attack  did they sway existing officials to their side, or did they run for office / join the bureacracy and work their way up the ranks? When they moved to suspend the Constitution, how many government officials refused to go along with it? And what happened to them?#I think that the SoJ did wield power and that they had people in the right positions such as the FBI, when Fred said that they were being tracked during a flashback in ep 6, and possibly further up the chain of political office etc. I’m pretty sure though that there were three separate attacks against Congress, The White House and The Supreme Court during the takeover, so unless specifically instructed to leave a minority alive then the SOJ most likely killed every single official on the premises, presumably at a State Of The Union Address.TL DR  Designated Survivor, but on steroids.#That makes a lot of sense. Get an SoJ member installed as the Secretary of some department or other, then conveniently kill everyone in the Presidential line of succession except him. And with no Congress to check his power -- that would get really scary, really fast.#Pryce mentions that the SoJ had chapters over thirty states, so it wouldn’t be implausible to see them gain ground not only domestically but politically too."

How do we really know that these black boys experience system-wide racism that causes them to be more likely to end up in a poorer category rather than black males tend to make different life choices than white males? Racism definitely exists and is a bad thing, but I don't think somebody ought to say this kid-adult earnings gap is causally explained by society-wide racism against black boys until they find real evidence.#Crazy part was, it wasn't the same amount g women.

I really love the one they did on what Congress has done to prevent gun violence, and it's just pages of grey squares indicating that they've done nothing.#i think it's implicit in the article when they discuss incarceration rates ... what would you count as real evidence? expose a group of white boys to the same rates of overpolicing/incarceration as black boys and see what life choices they make?#To be clear though, this is not just a NYT article. It's based on research from the Equality of Opportunity Project headed by Raj Chetty who is the definition of a rockstar in economics. If you go check out the site ([linked](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/) in the article) you can see all the 15 or so papers they've published all on the same topic.#What is more likely: black men across the board make choices that ruin their trajectories in life, or black men across the board experience racism due to the colour of their skin? If you say the former, then you're implying one of two things. Either black men are genetically predisposed to making poor choices by something which correlates with their blackness or the world in which they live prevents them from making good choices. That is, you're racist or you explain it using systemic racism.If you say the latter, then you affirm the anecdotal evidence which black people have provided for years and years. That is, you explain it using systemic racism.So 2/3 of your options to explain the observed data require systemic racism (which includes intergenerational effects, btw) as a mechanism and 1/3 relies on explicitly racist attitudes toward black people.Correlation doesn't imply causation, but correlation + a plausible mechanism *does*. The evidence for systemic racism you seek is right there in front of you  you either choose to see it or not.#There is a lot of sociology evidence showing this to be the case. Blacks get longer sentences for the same crimes, get less generous small business loans, are more likely to go to shitty schools (even as compared to poorer white kids), and more likely to be shot/arrested/harassed by the police. Not to mention there has been a long history of redlining where banks flat out refuse to loan money to black neighborhoods for housing loans. And that’s just the tip of ice berg. The evidence is vast on this topic. #Think about what that real evidence would constitute though, it's far too individualized and experiential to really derive clear data on the scale of a single human being let alone groups of people to make the case of systematic racism across groups. I agree with you it's wise not to draw conclusions but there are limitations to the clarity of endless data experiments. Causality is damn near impossible unless you choose a very simple well controlled problem sadly..."

First we have, what's perhaps best described (though not wholly accurate) as *Intent*  how is this data being used?We have *the Obama* example which was using data in order to more fairly and representatively redefine the electoral borders. This was done with the *intent* of making the system fairer. Conversely, you have *the Trump* example, which was using this data in order to specifically target 'propaganda' and further peddle 'fake news' in order to swing the election. The *intent* here wasn't fair, it was a weapon being deployed for selfish means. Second, we have what's perhaps best described (though not wholly accurate) as *Practice*. *The Obama* example used this data in practice very openly, and issued papers detailing what the data points implied and how the presidency was going to enact those data points. Transparency, effectively. *The Channel 4 Undercover Reporters* example meanwhile detailed that CA are more than happy to bribe and setup numerous individual persons using the data collated. This isn't transparent, it's also vergining on immoral. If you **just** look at ""*Politicians using data points*"" (as-per the majority of the examples listed in OP's post) then there is little to no difference. This is a mistake however, nobody is criticising the use of data generally speaking, it is specifically the *intents* and *practices* deployed by CA (and/or their customers) which is being brought into questions and is being labelled as immoral. *That's* the crux of the debate, not that data-gathering itself is under fire. #Re-watch the interview. Read a bit more. If you want to make comparisons, then make them, then source them, don't just vomit links in a partisan manner. Downvote. #Campaigns have always used data and even deceit to win elections.There is quite a big difference. The examples you linked, Obama in 2012 relied on obtaining this data from campaign sources like fundraisers or people in the field taking notes. The distribution of materials targetted was then very selective but the biggest deceit was the type of language used and selection of evidence.The big issue now is that we've got this massive database that everybody willfully participates in and psychological warfare techniques are being used which just involve making random shit up and targetting it in a much much more effective ways than a few letters ever could.There's always been ethical questions but it's far far more pressing with how effective this sort of thing can be implemented. When it goes as far as making up that a political candidate stole money from a third world country (a lot of Haitian voters in the key state of Florida were targetted with this and turnout was low) or that they are demonic satanic paedophiles and it gets to the stage where vulnerable young people on the spectrum are believing this shit and even occasionally inciting physical violence, that seems a big worry to me.If I had to sum it up and make a key distinction I'd say that the key difference is theft and the ethical issue of being able to stir up mass hatred in a way that other types of campaigning can't do.#https://www.channel4.com/news/cambridge-analytica-revealed-trumps-election-consultants-filmed-saying-they-use-bribes-and-sex-workers-to-entrap-politicians-investigationSeems worth a scandal even if you feel they're old tactics, don't you think?Also, the post comes off a bit as whataboutery given an unflinching focus on Obama (particularly in a UK sub), but I think it's right to raise wider questions about use of data in politics. The ongoing ICO investigation currently involves 30 entities.#>Having watched the C4 reports I cannot see anything that Analytica did that has not been done by both journalists and political campaigners almost since elections began.* Nix - “send some girls around to the candidate’s house”, adding that Ukrainian girls “are very beautiful, I find that works very well”.* Nix - “We’ll offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance, we’ll have the whole thing recorded, we’ll blank out the face of our guy and we post it on the Internet.”* “…Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company… so often we set up, if we are working then we can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists, there’s so many options we can look at. I have lots of experience in this.”#>Why is this even a scandal?Because the wrong team won.You're spot on, prepare to be downvoted into the depths.#Op It appears you asked a question, normally the purpose of that is to enable communication. Many people have come back to you, but you haven't acknowledged any of the comments or indeed replied to any of them. Would it be cynical of me to assume that you are being disingenuous and just wanted to post some whataboutisms? #Alexander, is that you? I'm sorry the board suspended you and all that.#Two main differences1) They are better at it than the old guard and have won elections for anti establishment types2) They nicked the data they usedThe second one is ofc terrible and needs sorting. But theres a wider debate to be had here about exactly how free people are to make decisions.Theres a reason that debate is not being gone into - here it isIf people can be swayed easily by advertising then the two systems our whole society is based on - free market economics and democracy - and completely and utterly compromised.Huge irony in defenders of globalised trade and liberal democracy essentially saying that neither system fucking works!#Honestly there's a lot of people still looking to find a way to square the circle of the failures of neoliberalism that led us to Brexit. All the media elite were shocked and many insulated middle to upper class people just couldn't see this coming. That doesn't change the fact that what Cambridge did was fucking nasty af. But I think a bit of reflection would show this is similar in goals to most political campaigning and PR firm cuntery. It's just mixed in with a little bit of fear of technology. And for good reason - this stuff is much more powerful and targeted. We saw it in the US when instead of spreading positive messages about Trump they would target African American communities with Clinton quotes about how she hated black people to discourage them from voting. It's blurring plenty of lines between advertising and propaganda that were already pretty blurred. Just now it's a) more clear and b) goes firmly against what the majority of the political commentariat wanted.Fairly sure not many will agree with me but that's my take.#Some people have decided to shoot them down.#https://manueldelia.com/2018/03/cambridge-analytica-psyops-methods-were-used-in-malta/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brexiteer-hard-brexit-eu-passport-buy-malta-christopher-chandler-single-market-customs-union-a8185336.htmlMakes u think#[deleted]#hmmm#He doesn't care about the question he asks in the slightest. Wonder if he's been on FB too much. #Channel 4 themselves have done all of those chasing scoops. So have most other major media organisations - setting politicians up in sex and mney stings is as old as journalism, ditto reporters pretending to be just joe blow to get inside an organisation.its laughable.#I could have taken that argument up until this expose tbh.Do you not feel a line has been crossed?#[deleted]#It also appears I have a fucking job which I have been at all day.It also appears that the question was rhetorical.#A lot of truth in this comment, I feel. The Filter Bubble seems to get more prescient by the day.I feel the focus needs to very much be on a), in spite of both b), and c) (what the majority of the elite anti-establishement commentators want)#The wrong side of the law, yeah. #Yep, what Cambridge Analytica do is just advertising. They are just an advertising firm.Just an advertising firm.#Channel 4 do it with the intent of the public finding out about it, which is a bit of a key difference.Stuff like the fake sheikh is a bit more questionable, tbf.#Some have yes, I'll wait for further details on **how many people they've offed** before fully demonising this organisation though. These lines are acceptably crossed by public bodies and existing private-politically tied groups not new upstart private entities. This furore is due to a cocktail of globally non-partisan private enterprise, spycraft smearing and outcome that's really pissed off the elites. #the illegality and the winning of elections for trump are actually seperate events.conflating the two is a neat trick#Cheers for answering rather than reflexively downvoting like other people seem to be. I think it manages to piss off both sides really.Yeah and explore why the establishment is so out of step. Rather than calling them all racist explore why they are seemingly revolting against immigration. People aren't born hating group x. We need to reflect on a system that makes them. I don't think the answer is less immigration btw. I think it's more down to social capital and trust [which is totally manageable](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/trust-me/). We just need to be committed.What we wanted was to import workers because it's good for GDP. But our commitment to more market based solutions made us blind to that fact the market wasn't serving this problem imo. We just dumped immigrants into communities near working class people and spent nothing integrating or building links across communities. Then called the working class racist when it didn't work. It was never going to work. We tried literally nothing to make it work.#So how much are you prepared to demonise them over corrupt practices that stop short of murder? Yes similar lines are crossed, but I'm not sure you can rally make a public interest argument in favour of their claimed practices.Would also rather not do a whole 'the elite is dead, long live the elite!' type affair. #> So how much are you prepared to demonise them over corrupt practices that stop short of murder?My stance is one of indifference towards CA. They've replicated, albeit poorly, the methods in which western democracies operate when in campaign mode. To demonise them is to demonise the state, when the state comes for them how do you pick a side?#I wouldn't say it's just the state coming for them though. And I don't feel so much obliged to take a side as to criticise both. I've been eagerly awaiting ICO outcomes since before this blew up."
AskReddit;85yck8;1521595899.0;/r/AskReddit/comments/85yck8/so_how_is_cambridge_analyticas_use_of_big_data/;So, how is Cambridge Analytica's use of big data for Trump is different from Obama's and Hillary's use of big data to target voters?;[deleted];"As best as I can tell, the serious answer is that CA was feeding stories to, and coordinating the approach of, multiple PACs, which is illegal.Edit: To say nothing of the apparent extortion  and bribery schemes, of course. But those appear to be separate from the data.#You might want to ask this over in /r/neutralpolitics#Long story short  we don't know because we don't know exactly how the data was used by CA, or the Obama and Clinton campaigns for that matter.  We know that they were roughly doing the same kinds of work and that Clinton's campaign was substantially larger than Trump's and that it made use of the same types of social media analyses that CA is famous for.The current controversy surrounds comments made by the CEO that suggested they would be happy to arrange to entrap a potential candidate in a sexual scandal.  They also alluded to spreading fake news via social media.  Clearly these sorts of practices are not acceptable and if they turn out to be true the company will probably not survive.Neither of those involve big data, however there is the matter of their use of data obtained via social media, which is a little more complex.Back in the day, Facebook set up their API to encourage developers to make apps for Facebook.  Companies responded and apps like FarmVille Bejewelled, etc began to appear.  Part of the API allowed developers access to parts of your Facebook data (status updates, likes, location information, etc) **and also** parts of your friends Facebook data, without requiring your friends' explicit consent.  This means that one of your friends could use an app that would garnish the app's developer with access to your status updates, likes, location, etc. and you would have been non-the wiser.  But crucially, **you agreed to this** when you signed up to the Facebook terms and conditions (that big long wall of text that you never read).It's surprising that there wasn't more of an outcry about this at the time but in 2015 Facebook quietly ended the practice, so it's not going on any more.  However, developers were not required to delete the information they had harvested unless explicitly asked to (by the friends of the people that didn't know... you get the picture).A company called Global Science Research created a Facebook app called This is my digital life, a quiz or questionnaire of some sort that was supposed to be an academic research tool.  They harvested Facebook data according to the Facebook ""no friend of mine deserves any privacy"" regime and sold it on for profit.  CA is alleged to have been one of the purchasers of this information (it's possible other campaigns bought and used it as well).As for what Cambridge Analytica actually did with the Facebook data? Ironically that's the bit we're more clear on.  They model and analyse social media data in the same way that the Obama campaign did so successfully and the Clinton campaigned try to ape (albeit less fruitfully).  * People are shocked that Facebook were so cavalier with their data (although we tried to warn them at the time) in instituting a system that seems purpose built for this type thing to happen.* People are surprised that data ostensibly collected by GSR for 'academic' purposes ended up being sold on the open market.  * People are, for some reason, angry that CA analysed data from Facebook (despite the fact that Obama did it twice and Hillary was doing her best to).* People are unsurprised that their friends didn't read the Facebook TOS, which ultimately caused the whole thing because if people had known what they were agreeing to when they signed up to Facebook they would never have done it.  People *ought* to be angry that Facebook essentially gave away their data to app developers.  Instead they're angry at the people who helped Trump get elected.  It's understandable that an emotional response would get directed towards the thing you hate.  I just hope in the coming months and years, when the regulators and legislators try and sort out this mess they direct attention where it's needed.#* CA stole data from Facebook (likely others) * CA entered into an agreement with Trump Campaign, but the whole operation was funded by Mercer, who may have leverage over Trump* CA very likely conspired with Russian organizations to amplify the effect of their disinformation campaign (e.g. the 13 Russians that were indicted last month) * CA/Russia were not simply advertising, they were using fake FB profiles, fake Reddit accounts to sway opinions in online groupsA normal campaign would hire the data firm and pay for it themselves. And, obviously, not work alongside foreign agents which is illegal.See this comment for another theory: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/85v9xy/exposed_undercover_secrets_of_trumps_data_firm/dw0i5ib/#The Russians were not involved.#From what I understand, the data Trump used was involuntary whereas other campaigns used voluntary info given.#Obama and Hillary's were using participants that opted in, CA used a loophole to take data from the friends of the people that opted in, so 250k opted in, but they gathered data on 50 million that did not opt it. They claimed it was for ""academic"" purposes only, held onto the data after they claimed they deleted it and then also passed it onto third parties without authorization.#You could expand this question to how is it different from anyone using the massive sets of data available to target anyone?  In a way this reminds me of people getting upset when others film them in public ""without permission"".  The odds of them already being filmed by a cctv system is already pretty high.  In the same way, people are go ape shit over this story but stay tuned for the commercial breaks. #But political parties do this too, they target the swing states with their campaigns.#Nothing is different. People are still looking for any way to get trump out of office. Anything at all even if it something their candidate did as well. #Not at all. CA lifted public data while FB sold Obama that data. I want to know about how much user data soyblue lifted. Either way fuck facebook and cuckerberg.#For one, it's proven and not just a dumb assumption so you can say 'no u!!!!!!!!'.#Trump. All things Trump is evil. Maybe people will realize that Facebook is working billions and billions but is free. EVERYONE is taking your information and selling it. #'big data' is a retarded name#This is level headed and well written.  I feel like I know something more about the issue instead of just being reminded of how everyone on Reddit feels about Trump.#So you’re referencing other Reddit conspiracy theories to support this conspiracy theory?  That’s one giant Reddit circle jerk. Also from what was stated Facebook is not claiming they stole it but rather the rule is you are to delete it after use. Facebook can make a larger profit if they can sell you the same thing over and over again. I think CA probably didn’t follow in good faith but also no one is. Facebook sells us all over the planet to who ever is buying. #Yeah you’ve bought into the Reddit conspiracy that doesn’t sound nearly as convincing outside of the circle jerk. What makes you confident enough to say ‘very likely’ it all leads back to the Russians? Yes Russia wanted Donald elected and used social media to do it (for benefit of mother Russia). Yes CA wanted and did the same thing (for profit). As far as i know there is no actual connection between these two separate things other than the fact that the guy who made the app studied in Russia, and the fact that Russia is the new boogeyman. I’m against what CA did, but it was not uncommon and fb knows this better than anyone. The passing on of data to third parties without users knowing, i mean. The part where that third party is tied to a political campaign, and a hugely despised and controversial one at that, is the real new/juicy part of this. Usually they’re just using data to help them sell more products, this time it was to elect an orang. #[deleted]#Obamas was from campaign supporters #Everything you do on Facebook is voluntary. You agree to let Facebook sell you. That’s why it’s free. CA bought your info from Facebook. If you don’t want that to happen stay off the internet. #TL DR Hillary had a more elaborate lie.#You’re clearly a part of ‘big big insertnoun haters’#I agree, that answered some of the questions I haven’t been able to have answered from searching actual articles on the web due to their bias and/or them just not fully grasping what happened. #True, but I don't think they were spreading fake news,  in the process, or engaging in bribary, and extortation like Cambrage was.  But maybe what Obama and Hilary did was the start of that slippery slope.#Not sure why this is downvotes. Politics is a dirty game and as far as I can tell the things trump have done aren’t any dirtier than the conspiracy setup to stop Bernie!#Yeah, Facebook management.#Obama’s data came not only from the volunteers supporting him who signed up but from their unwitting friends as well, that’s where the social graph building really came from. So i don’t see much difference, one camp had the shame to inconspicuously deceive its users rather than straight up lying to people, while the other (CA) felt ok about lying from the start. #[deleted]#[This is true] (https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56638#efmAAGAA2ADoAD0AElAE1AFCAFRAHdAI2)#Obama's data also came from the volunteers where as Cambridge came from a professor who broke Facebook's policies regarding the data.#It's as simple as the difference between blackmail, bribery and extortion and not blackmail, bribery and extortion.#I guess because it is so much on steroid overdrive, that people are sitting up and really taking notice.#[Very true](http://archive.is/UVEcp).""They came to office in the days following election recruiting & were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.""#Yeah but both amounted to the same thing - using users data without them knowing to build a tool to influence people online. Again, unless I’m wrong, the Obama operation not only used volunteer data but the data of their unwitting friends, which they were allowed to do under facebooks guidelines. Global Strategies were also allowed by Facebook to have all that data, just not to pass it on. Companies do pass on this data fb let’s them have, its fb’s fault for not enforcing (til now apparently)"

But the doubts were already cast aside by improved wage data yesterday. What matters now is that the BoE will confirm market expectations today. The central bankers would have every reason to come across more optimistically. So far the economy seems robust and inflation remains above target. Only the Brexit negotiations entail the most significant risk for the future development of the British economy. After all the old EU principle still applies: nothing has been agreed until everything has been agreed. As a result markets assume that the BoE will not take too clear a stance. Yes a further rate hike in May is possible, but any more, i.e. anything to provide sustainable support for Sterling, seems unlikely in view of the continued Brexit uncertainty...#https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/21/mexican-peso-canadian-dollar-jump-on-optimism-for-nafta-deal.htmlThe Canadian dollar and the Mexico peso rose on optimism that the U.S. may be softening some of its hard-line stance in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.EDIT: per moderator's instructions#I am short EUR/CAD and EUR/AUD.

Cambridge Analytical ""Harvest's 50 million Facebook accounts!""";"The revelation that big data gained access to 50 million facebook accounts is the real scandal of the 2016 election, with a cross section of Americans exposing the most intimate details of their lives, sex, loves, likes and most importantly, their political preferences, not only theirs but their friends and loved ones as well, the ""Holy Grail"" of data, a large enough slice of american demographics to build a ""Consistent"" model of behavior to accurately predict human responses to stimuli and circumstances, armed with this data an ""entity"" can build advertising campaigns with subtle or subliminal messages to influence a persons mood or pavlovian responses, even creating micro-aggression responses to a competitors brand or products, Pepsi VS. Coca-Cola. From the beginning of the information age there has been an attempt to harness ""Big Data"" for many reasons, to build an accurate picture of  a society or group to improve the functions of government, voting districts, access to services and allocation of resources, and in the ""Right"" hands it can improve the lives of the people it sampled, in the wrong hands it will build a society like what we are seeing in China, a social credit score based on whether you are a ""Good"" citizen.We can't turn back the clock on the information age, nor will we turn off social media, but we do have a choice in who uses this information and why, we have political power still, we have power as consumers, at least for now, we  can have an ""Open"" society with out fear if we make the right decisions now, we Vote for Progressives who will regulate and provide oversite to these creators and consumers of ""Big Data"", but.....time is running out, 1984 is now.";"1984 was peanuts. This is 2084.We can imagine so much more now.#Just think, for these 50 million facebook accounts, this is small potatoes to what the NSA has garnered, has accumulated on all it's American citizens as well as people all across the globe!And they gather this data, phone conversations, text messages, emails, all of our computer web site usage, Anything that you do that invoves anything Online, transmitting across the airwaves!!And they Don't do this for Benign, kind, good motive reasons  they do this so that they can have this data in case they ever Need it to get Back at you, once they figure you are NOW a threat to their Neoliberal, Neofascism, ""Inverted Totalitarianism"" state!So long as you are NO threat, no problem.

docker;86poxk;1521852941.0;/r/docker/comments/86poxk/docker_on_windows_or_docker_on_linux_vm_on_windows/;Docker on Windows or Docker on Linux VM on Windows?;I use Windows 10 on my computer. I need to test an app on Centos Linux that uses various Big Data distributions like Hive, Spark, Cloudera etc. Currently I use Virtualbox VMs but would like to spin up instances more quickly to test things out so I'm trying to see if Docker will work. I'm not deploying or developing anything, just testing and checking how to set things up. Ideally I'd like to incorporate kerberos to use with this as well.Should I install Docker for Windows and use linux containers (with Hyper-V) or should I have a Linux VM via Virtualbox (no Hyper-V) and use Docker on the Linux VM with various Linux containers?;I'd just use Docker for Windows, it's worked great for some Spark stuff I've done. Maybe it's obvious but one thing to remember though is you won't be able to use Virtual Box while Hyper-V is enabled.Edit: I should add that you can still run virtual machines, you just have to use Hyper-V as your hypervisor instead of Virtual Box.#I just switched to Linux to use docker cause it more closely matches the final infrastructure it will run on. Prefer it by far.#I'd install Linux on a spare harddrive and test out Docker from there.Other run it on a VM, no need to make life harder for yourself by using a second class citizen.#Just  boils down to which virtualization stack you prefer really. I'd probably just start with docker for windows . Either way you are getting some level of virtualization to start a linux kernel. Docker for windows probably integrates with windows (file sharing, etc) a little smoother than virtualbox, at least that is my experience with docker for mac.#I use docker on windows when I work from home because I'm lazy. It works great, no need for a VM. If what you do would work with docker on Linux, it will work on Windows.#Spark is very resource intensive. I started off using a Hortonworks image but I'm on bare metal now. YMMV. Essentially Docker for Windows *is* using a Linux VM via Hyper-V.I use a lot of VMWare on my Windows workstation so Hyper-V is a deal-killer.#This last point is key. It can be a dealbreaker. If you want to run VMs without having to use Hyper-V, you don’t want Docker for Windows. Edit: IIRC, you can still run VirtualBox, etc. with Hyper-V enabled, but you are limited to 32-bit VMs.#What if I run Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 in a VM and install Hyper-V and Docker for Windows, would that work? Did you use a Linux Docker container for Spark?#I've been running Docker on Linux for a bit now.  Praised Docker to all my Windows peeps and told them Windows has Docker now.  A few of them tried it with mixed results, so I tried it myself and was grossly disappointed.  Linux is so much easier and cleaner (no vm's).  This was of course before Microsoft started adding Ubuntu to Windows 10.#But since you are alreay using virtualbox might as well just use that. If you have some iterative process of spinning up instances you could use vagrant with virtualbox too.#I think I can run Windows Server 2016 as a VM and install Docker for Windows there instead. Not sure what way I should go with.#That would probably work provided you have a CPU that supports nesting but not sure what the performance would look like. Yes I'm pretty sure it was a Linux Docker container.#I've been using Docker on Ubuntu/Fedora at work for over a year with different projects, and I have had nothing but grief from my attempt at replicating this at home on a Windows 10 Pro machine. #Ubuntu in windows doesn't support docker so it's still not much better.#I have base virtualbox VMs and clone them as needed. But it takes 10 minutes to clone which is slower than I'd like.#If you are going to install a VM on your Windows 10 box specifically to run Docker, why not go with Debian or Ubuntu? IMO, Docker is way more stable and easier to manage on Linux, and the VM Docker host would also be less resource-heavy. Guest additions for Linux are much easier to install than Windows as well. The VirtualBox team uses Debian themselves for whatever that’s worth. I have used most of the setups mentioned here, and my Ubuntu physical host running VirtualBox is the most stable. However, when I am running a Windows host with VMs, I always install Docker on one of the Linux VMs, because I just find it easier to manage that way. I just prefer VirtualBox and like that it’s open source, and I’ve never cared for Hyper-V at all. I personally find it overly-complicated and over-engineered like many things Microsoft puts out. Not really hating on Microsoft, as I am very comfortable on Windows, but it’s just more of a personal preference. Fiddle around with a few scenarios and go with whichever is most comfortable for your situation. Edit/TL DR: If you want to run VMs without Hyper-V, go with a VM guest as a Docker host. Otherwise, just use Docker for Windows and Hyper-V. It’s much simpler and straightforward, and there’s no need to add another layer of virtualization if you don’t actually need it. #linked clones should be much faster vs full clones ..#I'm used to Centos and the app is used on redhat but I suppose the VM OS used for Docker doesn't really matter since I can run a centos container on top. Very interesting, I guess I just need to try out different scenarios like you note, thanks.#Interesting, I didn’t realize I can make changes to a linked clone and not affect the original clone. This is great thanks.#FYI, if you have the RHEL ISO, you can create a Docker image from it. I have done it before, and it’s fairly straightforward. #Good to know thanks.
consulting;86vabn;1521919179.0;/r/consulting/comments/86vabn/advice_for_an_inexperienced_management_consultant/;Advice for an inexperienced Management Consultant;Hello everybody!Thank you in advance for taking your valuable time to read this post.I have worked in a small consulting firm since I graduated almost 3 years ago. I never expected to get into this business, nor I had ever imagined that I would specialize in Human Resources Management.Since the firm is small, I have had a very prominent role in all the projects we have led  conducting a lot of research  leading behavioral pattern interviews to define and create job descriptions  studying business processes through observation and quantitative analysis, etc. The foregoing I have managed pretty much on my own with the mentorship and direction of my employer (a management consultant with 40+ years of experience and founder of the company).However, I want to expand my knowledge on further specific topics. I have found myself absorbed in the implications of technology in consulting  how big data and analytics help improve organizations' performance. I 'd like to believe I can provide a contrasting viewpoint if I devote some of my time to study and take online courses on this topic.Yet, I am an inexperienced professional and I am not sure this is the ideal action to follow. My employer has an immense background and has maintained a decent number of clients. However, he is in 70's and he has no plan of innovating or offering me some training  everything I learn is from his guidance and my involvement on the field.I like to work here because I am independent and every new project is a good opportunity to receive feedback from our clients. Still, I am not planning to settle here, so I would rather have better familiarity with today's consulting world to be ready to advance in my career.What kind of courses should I look at?  Where should I set my focus on? What further actions would you recommend? Again, thank you very much for your time.;"You need to be more specific about tech in consulting or big data/analytics. In what kind of consulting? Have you heard of organizational psychology, which is the science behind HR management and uses a *lot* of data analytics and complex modeling to improve productivity and bottom line business metrics.If that sounds at all interesting to you, if you want to stay somewhere within the HR management space but towards people analytics and data analysis/tech, feel free to reach out as I'm in an org psych grad program right now while I work in the applied science consulting field.#> Where should I set my focus on?That is the question. Consider starting with what you have to do right now, what is under your nose. If you have some particular questions, you can write those here.#Hello and thank you very much for your quick response!Yes, I have read about organizational phycology, but I don't fully understand how it works. In our firm, we use none analytics or data applications to develop processes  our work relies on experience and the study of the organizational framework and its direct competitors. I am interested in big data and overall technology implementations in the workplace. Not only for its convenience to apply new methods or improve processes. I have noticed how smart devices and social media jeopardize people’s productivity. It is a highly inspiring field, and I plan to stay in the Human Resources spectrum of consulting. I would truly appreciate any kind of help or suggestion from you. #Thank you for your response.I like consulting a lot. It is just that where I work everything is very “traditional” and slow-paced, so sometimes I get a little anxious. I have learned a lot, and I am sure I would not change this experience for anything because I have become very self-disciplined.My questions are:* Where is consulting going? What tendencies should I look at?* What books should I read to broaden my perspective?* What courses should I take to improve my career chances?* How long should I stay here before I move into a different path in my career? I am 25 years old, and really try to seize every opportunity to learn. But I am always surrounded by people way older than me and it gets a little stressful. #You're very welcome! Org psychology is essentially the science behind what works and what doesn't regarding people in the workplace. Some topics we scientifically investigate include: recruitment, selection, performance management, feedback, bonuses, employee engagement, leadership, training/onboarding, and retention/turnover.Just like any other science, we use the scientific process of asking questions, designing controlled studies, and using analytics to evaluate the outcomes of those studies. Obviously there are way more challenges and potential sources of error in a behavioral science rather than a physical science, but we try our best through various techniques to address those issues.There is absolutely a positive and a negative side to technology in the workplace, and there are people doing research on that topic as we speak. There are ongoing debates about surveillance in the workplace, how immediate feedback should be, and whether we should be gamifying everything that goes on at work.Here are some articles to get you started:https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-trends/2017/people-analytics-in-hr.htmlhttps://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/people-analytics-reveals-three-things-hr-may-be-getting-wronghttps://www.entrepreneur.com/article/284550And here's a coursera course you may want to take to learn more:https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-people-analyticsIf you'd like, I can also send you some academic papers or suggestions for textbooks to read. I grabbed one for really cheap before I started grad school and it helped me get a sense of what people analytics and org psych was when I didn't have any background.I think you'll find that you like this approach better than simply relying on experience and market research, as it is more robust and gives us reliable insights, something our gut intuition is not as good at doing. Let me know if you'd like some more resources, but this is a good place to start if you want to add tech capabilities and science to your skill set already.#> What books should I read to broaden my perspective?Read the local wiki:https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/MCWhatIshttps://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mcreadingSurf this sub for a while also.> What courses should I take to improve my career chances?What are your career goals?> I am always surrounded by people way older than me and it gets a little stressful.Convince them to hire a young intern to help the firm to grow and to change :)#very good comment, thank you！#Wow, thank you. I appreciate that you took the time to compose a so thoughtful reply.I can see what you mean by Org. psychology because I am familiar with all the processes you named. The difference is that (as I pointed out before) we do not apply a scientific method or a structured procedure to so. We rely on the analysis of several clients’ cases and use that information (compared to other companies within the same sector) to design suited suggestions for their areas for improvement.The negative connotations of technology usage in the workplace are particularly interesting. I have been investigating a lot on the subject  the ethical allegations framed around this issue seem well articulated. That is why I have been seeking for feedback on this matter.I will dive into all the material you gave me. This is what I was looking for  the coursera course looks so interesting. I can certainly tell you I will take it. Also, I will gladly accept any kind of bibliography you could provide me. The idea that I could carry out new techniques to promote growth at the firm and display a different approach to our clients’ needs excite me. I honestly think I can make a difference in my community!Again, thank so much for helping me. It is so refreshing to know there are people on the internet eager to aid a stranger in need!#Thank you for your reply! Well, it looks I have a lot of homework to do. I will look at all the material on this subreddit.My career goals aren't clear (I recognize this is my fault). I'd say that what I want the most is to get involved in significant projects  working alongside passionate people who wish to make an impact  fostering a shift in clients' mentality to be more self-conscious  traveling to learn from diverse experts linked to various sectors to address unique strategies. As I said, the firm I work at is a very small one (although very prestigious). I'll try to convince my boss to hire an intern or something, but sometimes is kind of difficult to promote a change in his way of doing certain things.Again, thank you very much!#No problem, I didn't know about this niche area before getting into it, but now it's super exciting to me! Happy to answer any other questions : )#No problem at all!I thought you would be, just giving you a sense of the reach of the science behind these things : ) If you PM me, I'm happy to send you some resources I've made to help people understand the power of things like science-based hiring, and I can send you some more resources that I can't make fully public (such as the reading lists for my courses, which would out me lol).Absolutely, and we're seeing a lot of discussion about that right now with Cambridge Analytica and of course, every time there's a data breach which has become very frequent.Glad this is exciting to you, it definitely has the power to transform the way that we approach clients needs, to build on what you're already doing and bring innovative and creative ideas to HR challenges (something we don't see that often - creativity in HR!). You absolutely can make a difference, and I'm happy to send some things over. Send me a PM with your email so I can attach some research papers and reading lists, in addition to the resources I'm writing for practitioners such as yourself : )#>  I'll try to convince my boss to hire an intern or something, but sometimes is kind of difficult to promote a change in his way of doing certain things.That is a common practice to invite young people before your competitors have hired them. That is ok even if you do not hire interns after the internship.#> Well, it looks I have a lot of homework to do. I will look at all the material on this subreddit.Well, all the material is excellent - but you do not need to look at **all**.#Q1: what forum/website you frequently visit to get the knowledge/trend in this field?Q2: Does your client measure change, calculate ROI? my clients reached out to my firm for change. Many times I didn't feel they spend the money wisely. They have mentality of ""use the budget of this fiscal year before it get expired"".Q3: Did your work bring positive change to client? An example in my firm, client ask for an integration, a report solution, once we delivered, we moved on next project, we (at least I) never know if that change truly bring positive impact to client. #> we moved on next project, we (at least I) never know if that change truly bring positive impact to client. I guess, if that change brings negative result, you do not get the next project :)#Great questions!1) I'm in grad school, so I generally read primary research papers. You can find these on google scholar (scholar.google.com) or a site called ResearchGate. However, those are hard to understand because they are filled with a lot of jargon. Some great places are Bersin by Deloitte, a podcast called Department12, and some leaders in the field on LinkedIn including Adam Grant, Keith McNulty, and others I can make a list of if you'd like.2) We help our clients to identify which metrics are important (first by reframing their question from a behavioral science perspective), design experiments around them, and then measure causes in a way that is more precise and robust than traditional analytics (and even better than big data/data science approaches). From this, we calculate ROI and we can predict the cost savings from our smaller experiments to a larger rollout, which reduces risk for the client. However, we are not always able to get to that stage with the client, as sometimes they don't want to go to the experiment and analytics stage. We always provide them with the analysis and experiment plan so they have a roadmap of where they should be going to measure change and calculate ROI.However, we definitely see those challenges as well. There are various systems design issues and incentives that lead us to use all the budget we have available, even if we don't need it. And that's something we try to educate clients about. but unfortunately they don't typically allow us to make the radical changes that would move them away from feeling the need to use their whole budget.3) Great question. It does, and we have the data to show that our strategies we've implemented result in a substantial ROI for the client. The key is that we conduct scientific experiments, so we only change the one thing we're suggesting and measure the difference compared to business as usual. With traditional strategy engagements, it's sometimes impossible to do this. However, our scientific approach makes it possible, because that's exactly what science is! I really enjoy working on things where I can see the impact right away, which is why this approach is so exciting and new for the consulting field.#That's true. What I am getting at, client and we usually measure solution delivery itself, but rarely look at if the solution has impacted on business process. #The metrics you help client to define, and the scientific data which you can measure the roi, this is indeed interestingThank you for sharing!#Thanks! Wish I could share more but a lot is in development and proprietary from where I work, but there's a ton of work and case studies out there that are doing the same thing. You're very welcome!#Once again Thank you for your willingness to share, it mean a lot to me.#You're very welcome, anytime!"

In healthcare I'd imagine the use of data can become pretty weird and twisted around. However, a company like Amazon is using data to do amazing things.The more transactional the business the more it can be exposed to analytics. The less it is about transactions, and more about interactions with people, the less useful it becomes and can, in fact, become a hindrance.#I believe this depends on the business.  A lot of companies have a hard time implementing it but others have successfully done it.  Python is great for data analysis if you need to do a lot of data manipulation and need to combine data in different ways.  Excel can still be useful but python can take it to another level.  #these are all real things, but those terms been really watered down and probably 80% of the time are just sales buzzwords. a few companies know what they are actually doing. #As a BI professional for almost 20 years, I can tell you it's a constant challenge.  Outside of data integration (not BI work, but you always have to do it), a few of the biggest issues are: Tool panacea (this too will solve all your problems!), Lack of BI knowledge by the users (basically people don't know where to start), and lack of skill from those implementing the BI solution.  Another issue I constantly deal with is getting people to define how the business works.  You'd be surprised at how the definitions vary across the company.  Getting consensus on something like ""The Customer Tier Marketing Program"" can be a challenge, because everyone has their own interpretation as to what that program means.  Even simple calculations like Gross Margin can be challenging, because different people will calculate it differently, based on where they work.  The short answer is that most companies are shitty in relation to analytics.  However, all of them can benefit by knowing more about their data.  Just by building consensus around their terms is HUGE.  It simplifies lives and reduces organizational friction.  It can just be really tough getting there.#Id figure HC would be able to be driven by the claims and patient data. Problem is, we have a whole team dedicated to that... while I am stuck in accounting.#Unfortunately, my role nor my company has much use for anything beyond excel. Not sure if going down a data analyst/analytics path is worth it.#Probably not wise to chase a career in it huh#I’ve “transitioned” from thinking like an accountant to more of a BI professional and I’m starting to feel discouraged because it seems like we already have analysts (VP level) that own and analyze the data. We don’t go into any form of statistical analysis, our BI tool is a step up from a spreadsheet, and we have no EDW.I don’t even know how to learn tools that my company won’t use and try to apply for other companies. Just seems like the drive behind anything data or analytics related is just FOTM and not a career I should really explore. Companies just aren’t ready or don’t need it.#i don't know about that, i think you're just at a slow adopting company. regardless of these things being buzzwords, there is a growing market for people with true data science skills. if you're technically inclined it wouldn't hurt to build skills in those areas. look up data science and business intelligence jobs to get an idea of what they look for and what the pay is, and keep in mind in another 10 years there will be more demand as more slow moving companies like yours get younger leadership and begin seeing the true value in analytics. #Have you looked at web anaytics?#All BI starts at the database.  Do you have any database experience?  I'd start there.  Get some decent experience by downloading SQL and the AdventureWorks DB and have at it.  Also, Tableau Public is a good way to do front end stuff for free.  If you want to leave your current company, make a portfolio and put it on the web for people to see.  Post all of this on LinkedIn.  Have you been to /r/dataisbeautiful?  Another good resource for ""data analytics.""  The phrase, ""if you build it, they will come"", is extremely relevant to BI.  If you can show others that you're solution provides more insights and is easier to maintain, you win.  However, you may not be able to do this in your current position, so get yourself prepared so you can move on.#How can I get those data science skills with a BBA? #I have not, but I don't know how useful this would be in my field (behavioral healthcare). Seems I'm in the wrong industry for BI.#I know SQL very well. I passed the first round of MSSQL certs (MTA) and wish I could move into more complicated coding. Im familiar with triggers, CTEs, temp tables, etc.Learned Tableau while at a former employer and know it enough to develop mid tier visualizations.I don’t know how to focus on a side project... not a clue how to get a portfolio going that would be valuable. I’m definitely interested and driven, just confused and need some coaching.#i'd probably start by googling it like i did: https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/01/20/whats-the-best-path-to-becoming-a-data-scientist/#2b5babc737d2#Do you have any modeling experience?  Facts, dims, and such?  That usually helps with doing a side project.  Also, some web sites will let you download data pretty easily.  I think even reddit does that.  A while back I did some analysis on Powerball numbers by pulling data from the Powerball site.  Frequencies of certain numbers, and such.  It doesn't have to be complicated, just show you can think analytically and be able to show that to someone.#I do know some data dimension modeling knowledge. I built out a financial data mart at my last company all from scratch. I need to read Kimball, so that’s my next goal.I just don’t know what is worth the time, etc..."

Is this Java, or Python or R or Scala. What is the order of popularity of these languages? ;My experience is the polar opposite of /u/stevecrox0914. Scala is still the defacto standard for big data engineering basically everywhere I've seen (at least in Australia). I'm even seeing a lot of places upskilling data scientists in scala as well. Java is used but nowhere near as much.Python and R are the main langauges data scientists use atm.If anything there is somewhat of a shift towards SQL as an interface to everything rather than any specific programming language.#Scala's dead, it was a good idea but the architecture approach of spark/Nifi/Hadoop made it unnecessary. The gains it provides are reduced due to the poorer bindings it gets.Java has top support everywhere and is your software engineer choice.Python running on Jython, is the choice of data scientists.It depends on what you want to do.#I wonder if thats a timing of  big data adoption for your industry/area, Where I am Scala appeared as the latest technology fad. You would get an evangelist telling you how Scala would solve all your applications performance problems. Alas most an applications problems were EJB's or the SQL database. Dumping EJB's and moving the systems to NoSQL databases (anouther new craze) allowed drastically larger datasets and a ridiculous improvement to performance.By the time anyone felt the need to look at Hadoop/Storm the Scala fad had burnt out and the Java bindings were reasonably good.I've noticed Hive (SQL) appearing more and more. I wish Pig had won that one.#Python is the choice of data scientists. Running on Jython, though? I don't see that.#Couldn't agree more - sure in Silicon Valley you might find decent Scala talent but take a walk in other countries and Java is king with Python for Data Science.Have seen some shops starting with R or SAS but they almost always start a transition to Python and Java.Most interesting thing will be to see what happens when Hadoop 3 comes in with Mesos/Docker instead of only YARN (Java) based containers - native Python at scale without PySpark? Who knows... Going to be interesting.#I see it in when loading into things like Hadoop, they are used to Python, dumping Python into a Maven project and adding Jython is fairly painless and then you can deploy to a cluster.#[deleted]#Yes, in a Hadoop environment I could totally see that that.  A lot of data science is done in non-Hadoop environments, however.#PySpark introduces a layer of Java serialisation as it has to use Spark under the covers cause Spark is Java and YARN can only do resourcing for Java based workloads. In theory we'll see non Spark/Java based frameworks with a Mesos/Docker based resourcing frameworks opening the door to new and very different workloads.FYI I'm more ex-Java dev than Python but have heard this from a peer who loves Python and hates Java.#I'm aware, to be honest I've only worked with either highly experienced ones once we have a bunch of data somewhere (where Jython gets handy) or junior people needing something to work with for research.Maven with Jython extensions is trival to support when all of your developers are using Java/Maven and so I give them that and leave them to whatever they were doing.#Also yes, I'm aware Spark is really only Java bytecode written in Scala but its still Java at the end of the day.

I have been learning and using Scala for about 6 months. I work alone at the moment. I have fallen in love with Scala.So here's the thing, I can get everything I need done to work in Scala. This includes fairly complex tasks such as manipulating Spark Streaming, designing and running big data pipelines, data reduction on big data etc. BUT, I find it really difficult to assess my learning and skillset.I look at open source scala code such as Spark quite a lot. I try and think functionally, and I try and keep code as succinct as possible. Judging from open source code, even the top professionals tend to be frugal in their use of, say, implicits, currying, and other more specialist functions. At the same time, I can't help but feel that I am basically using scala as java with Option and much much better lambda functions.So what can I do to ensure that I am evaluating my code properly? I can imagine applying for a Scala job in the future and would like to be up to scratch.;"I think a good way to do this might be to hang out on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/scala/scala) and chat with other developers, go to conferences, listen to talks online, get involved in an open-source project, etc.  so you can get to know other good Scala programmers and learn how they think about things. A lot of it will come down to style and interest. I'm an ok functional programmer but would get tossed out on my ass if I tried to interview for an Akka job. Nobody is good at everything … Scala is a big language.#I'm in a similar place. I have been using Scala less than a year and have fallen in love. I recommend getting the ""red book"" and trying out some of the middle chapters when you're feeling ambitious. It helps give you a grounding on the type system and what is possible.Finally I will say that I dislike job interviews that focus on obscure details of languages to test your knowledge. I find that language quirks can be quickly learned as needed but having an intuitive sense of how to solve problems in a given language is much more important.#The [lambdaconf ladder of functional programming](http://lambdaconf.us/downloads/documents/lambdaconf_slfp.pdf) got a lot of mockery and criticism when it came out, but I do think it's a good effort in this direction (though of course specific to one particular style of programming) of making you aware of what skills and techniques are out there that you might want to learn.#See Scala Competency Levels by Odersky: http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/8610This kind of thing is subjective of course, but it's a good list of topics to explore.#I tell people Scala is like a swimming pool -- you don't have to dive in the deep end to learn how to swim.  Martin Odersky put together a [list](http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/8610) of Scala skills for application developers and library developers.Generally, I'd say the learning curve of Scala are the bits not covered by Java: learning how to use functions, and then how to use implicits, and then how to use the type system.  Don't get discouraged if you don't get it all at once -- the contributors have been doing this for years and sometimes forget how long it took to wrap their heads around. #[wartremover](http://www.wartremover.org/) inspects your code a bit more deeply than scalastyle.  You can avoid more javaisms with the OptionPartial, Throw, and TryPartial rules documented here:http://www.wartremover.org/doc/warts.html#You can use [Scalastyle](http://www.scalastyle.org/) to avoid javaisms.  For example, these rules can help you avoid `null`, `return`, `var`, and `while` in your code:      <check enabled=""true"" class=""org.scalastyle.scalariform.NullChecker"" level=""error""/>      <check enabled=""true"" class=""org.scalastyle.scalariform.ReturnChecker"" level=""error""/>      <check enabled=""true"" class=""org.scalastyle.scalariform.VarFieldChecker"" level=""error""/>      <check enabled=""true"" class=""org.scalastyle.scalariform.VarLocalChecker"" level=""error""/>      <check enabled=""true"" class=""org.scalastyle.scalariform.WhileChecker"" level=""error""/>See also http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala for other rules you might want to apply either with scalastyle or other tools.#Just keep looking at the code behind popular Scala libraries and looking at idiomatic Scala code and it will come naturally. If you can, contribute to OSS Scala projects in small ways and benefit from the community code reviews.Also helps to try and build hello-world or better apps using interesting scala frameworks. In no particular order:- akka- play- cats/scalaz- finagle- algebirdEach of these give you exposure to new patterns and paradigms.Worth noting that w.r.t Spark specifically, most of the contributors are writing (very good) Scala that looks like Java for a variety of reasons. Especially the memory management, concurrency and performance optimization code. As a result, the source code tends to be less focused on idiomatic Scala and more focused on code that works as fast and correctly as possible.#I wouldn't worry about applying for Scala jobs specifically.  Almost nobody asks in an interview if you know some specific part of a programming language.#> Judging from open source code, even the top professionals tend to be frugal in their use of, say, implicits, currying, and other more specialist functions. At the same time, I can't help but feel that I am basically using scala as java with Option and much much better lambda functions.If you are looking at ""most"" as the spark apis, sure. That's because of the databricks style guide, which explicitly states to avoid implicits: https://github.com/databricks/scala-style-guideMany other open source projects, such as fs2 and Monix and Play! use implicits liberally (about 1% of the sloc):https://github.com/monix/monix -- 868 lines in main code of the word implicit out of 73946 lines of code according to slochttps://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2 -- 262 lines of main code with the word implicit out of 12636 according to slochttps://github.com/playframework/playframework - 1015 lines with the word implicit in main code out of 82585 lines according to sloc.This is opposed to Spark (note that it is a much larger project in terms of lines of code, it hand 534707 objects in git!):1051 occurrences of the word implicit in main code. It has 615813 lines of code according to sloc.Note that implicit is mainly used for paramaters to functions, in monix, out of 4578 defs in main, 868 of them take implicit arguments, for example.  That's ~25% of the methods.The thing is, unless you are writing your own applications outside of a framework, you should be following the conventions of the framework you are using. So in Spark -- use fewer implicits. In https -- yeah, probably using currying and implicits.If you follow the convention of your framework, and can test and change things easily, you are writing quality code for your domain.#didn't know about Gitter. Thanks#red book?#I’m still not a huge fan of it but I think it’s somewhere to start #Is this an intellij plugin?#fs2, Monix and Play! are *libraries* (or frameworks, whatever), not *applications*. Libraries tend to define more implicits because that's how you write generic code in Scala. Applications tend not to define implicits often, if at all. They of course call APIs with implicits, so they *materialize* implicits all the time, but don't *define* them.This distinction can even be visible in code written *by the same developer* in *the same repository*, if there are parts of the repo that are more library-like and others that more application-like. For example, in https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js you'll find that dichotomy being strongly present. Under [`library/`](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/tree/master/library/src/main/scala/scala/scalajs/js), you'll find (unsurprisingly) a library-like area with lots of definitions of implicits. But under [`linker/`](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/tree/master/linker/shared/src/main/scala/org/scalajs/linker), you'll be hard-pressed to find a single non-local implicit definition.#He means [this one](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)#It's a standalone program but IntelliJ has built-in support for it.  If you add a project/scalastyle_config.xml file to your project root then IntelliJ will highlight violations in your scala code as configured in that file.You can then use https://github.com/ngbinh/gradle-scalastyle-plugin to check for violations at build time if you use Gradle, or http://www.scalastyle.org/maven.html for Maven, or http://www.scalastyle.org/sbt.html for sbt.#I agree and that's a very important distinction. Most apps are separated into a library and a program, certainly.Also, I call play and spark frameworks because they mostly call your code and have a prescriptive way of integrating with them. You can also use their libraries as libs in your applications - play-json, twirl, etc.Something like akka and fs2/monix are libraries because they are smaller and you call them.It's subtle, but you can definitely tell the difference.  Fs2's streamApp might actually blur the lines a bit, there, too, I suppose."

AskAcademia;8a3fn4;1522961605.0;/r/AskAcademia/comments/8a3fn4/your_thoughts_on_using_digital_data_from_social/;Your thoughts on using digital data - from social media use on Facebook to wearables like Fitbit - in scholarly research studies?;As many of you may have heard, between social media sites like Facebook, wearable technologies like FitBit, to cell phone or computer use, our personal data is rapidly being turned into more and more big data. What is good about this though, is that this information can also be used for social science and medical research, and I think it really opens up some new opportunities. My partner and I are building a platform to collect this big data to be used for scholarly research. I am wondering if what type of researchers you think might be interested in this? Is this interesting to you? Would you be comfortable sharing this type of information? Or any other thoughts you might have. Thanks!;"Google it? Been and being done.  Work is also being done on ethics and methods. #It can be a real bitch to cite, and depending on the source it might not be scientifically reliable (thinking of Fitbit step counts, for example  that data is always a pretty rough estimate). But it's an academic gold mine because so much goes on in the digital world. I've used a lot of material from Facebook and Twitter for research on language change and attitudes towards language/language change. There's so much of it that you can run statistics on it, and come to some legit conclusions about things. The problem is that it's not always easy to access because of privacy considerations and in some cases even ownership rights. #Already being done - plenty of people in HCI, public health, medical informatics doing research in behavior change, improving patient experience using wearables as a data point. Check out JAMIA for articles on this sort of thing. Seems to be an expanding field with many avenues for funding, esp. with US Congress’ creation of Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute.#Commonly done in my field (audiology) already. Hearing aids have had datalogging capabilities for about a decade now, recording such parameters as hours of use, time spent using the different programs, and time spent in different acoustic environments. The recent introduction of smartphone-connected hearing aids has also opened up the option of real-time monitoring and two-way communication between the clinician and the hearing aid user via the cloud. For real-time data collection techniques, check out ecological momentary assessment (EMA) if you're not familiar with it already.#People do this in my field (human-computer interaction) all the time, and therefore also discuss the ethics of doing it all the time. Although there are already ethical standards for this kind of research, they're somewhat in flux given the rapidity of technological change. #>My partner and I are building a platform to collect this big data to be used for scholarly research.Good luck getting that.The companies that already collect it are not going to share it with you.If people share it, you will need informed consent paperwork and a paper trail for every single person, and to maintain that for each set of data when people access it. That creates all sorts of additional privacy concerns.Collection of location / health data is already raising serious red flags with respect to privacy and personal autonomy, and that's with private companies that (supposedly) anonymize the data before releasing it.Note also that scholarly research using primary data collected from individuals *or* groups typically requires institutional review board approval.I don't see any way that your idea could work. There are far too many hurdles. You're basically proposing to become some kind of big personal data repository. I honestly have no idea how you'd overcome all of the potential problems with privacy and data collection and availability / access.**Note:** Researchers who collect this kind of information for their studies want the least-biased data they can get. Filtering for people only who would opt into this kind of data collection, and you'd get an extremely biased sample. I don't see how this would create useful datasets for most research.#There is a lot of work to be done on the ethics side for sure. I often wonder how much internal research Facebook is able to do, with never a review board in site.#It do believe it will end up being an academic gold mind - not only the quantity of data, but the fact that it is already in a digital form lend it so more easily to mathematical analysis.Do you have any thoughts about the real-time nature of it? One can iterate experiments or interventions across your sample on an on-going basis - Facebook does this for sure but with the increasing amount of things (location, activity, audio clips) being tracked, on-going, more material/real world behavioural studies/changes can be preformed as well. #Thanks for those two suggestions. I will definitely look further into them.Here's a couple bullets I found in a report (link below), showing the expected growth of activity especially in the medical field.Published evidence of digital health will increase over 500 percent through 2022 In 2018, approximately 340 digital health efficacy studies will be completed and published, continuing the trend of building hard evidence to support digital tools and interventions.An acceleration of evidence building will bring an estimated 3,500 studies over the next five years and the incorporation of apps by major professional groups into practice guidelines.Alignment on the appropriate sets of features and safeguards for apps has emerged and technology innovators are advancing into the field in significant numbers. Integration with provider workflows that occur in the next five years will be critical to stakeholder adoption.The emergence of well-designed apps and mobile devices offers the potential to improve outcomes for patients, sometimes at near-zero incremental costs#I could see why your field would be all over that. :)I will definitely look into this sampling technique. The real-time nature of the data, the continuous sampling, the indefinite need to actually ""end"" a study and instead analysis again and again - I am excited by it and all the feedback echoing that here. #That's really something that interests me - that in some fields, like yours, or in the private sphere, the ethics policies aren't as rigid and onerous whereas in other (see the response from deeconblues99 below) field not only are the ethical requirement daunting some believe that can't be overcome.#You raise some good points.>The companies that .. share it with you.There already are sharing it with us. You can go to www.healthbrain.co and see you for yourself. Now, yes we are only intergrated with few platform for now and it will be a challenges, and some platform may be impossible to access, but data exchanges occur between platform regularily - that's why god invented the API.>If people share it, you will need informed consent paperwork and a paper trail for every single person, and to maintain that for each set of data when people access it. That creates all sorts of additional privacy concerns.That's the beauty of it all being digital data. The participant consents online for each instance they share data, and because it's a digital ""file folder"" you can accurately track who access what. This is very surmountable as far as I can see. >Collection of location / health data is already raising serious red flags with respect to privacy and personal autonomy, and that's with private companies that (supposedly) anonymize the data before releasing it. Yes, there are serious privacy & personal autonomy concerns but considering the evidence (the increasing use of these studies in the health domain) and the efficacy (it helps improve health and save lives) they will be worked out.>Note also that scholarly research using primary data collected from individuals or groups typically requires institutional review board approval.This is a point that does concern me as I look more deeply into which fields to integrate with next (part of the reason I made this post) - that's why we are starting with studies in the health and wellness space where the utility of what we are doing is such that there are legal ways to get it done and it's worth the trouble.>I don't see any way that your idea could work. There are far too many hurdles. You're basically proposing to become some kind of big personal data repository. I honestly have no idea how you'd overcome all of the potential problems with privacy and data collection and availability / access.Well it's my job to make it work. I have spent the last 7 months trying to work out exactly how and bring together the team to do it. If you go to the website and sign up, you can see it unfold for yourself :)Thanks for raising some concerns. And yes, the sample will uselessly biased for many things until we get ALOT of users.

Talk to people about what their day-to-day is like, ask about their long term career goals, and try to understand how their degree helps them reach those goals. #1. It certainly could be. There's nothing stopping most MDs from doing some for of research, particularly if they're willing to work (at least early on) on their own time. However, it can be much easier to negotiate for protected research time as an MD-PhD. In addition, getting protected time for research is only half the battle, funding for your studies is also pretty neato, and MD-PhDs have the highest rate of grant approval of any other degree holders in academia. While this is probably a chicken and the egg issue of - do MD-PhDs just better grant writers than their PhD or MD counterparts? Probably at least to a degree, since they've had experience both in the clinic and in the lab. Are study sections more likely to fund them due to some inherent positive bias? Maybe a bit. Regardless, physician scientists with the dual degree are more likely to obtain funding.2. Again, you don't *need* a PhD for anything. However, writing grants, manuscripts, designing studies, developing hypotheses are all skills, and the extra training in a PhD program may be helpful in the future studies you might hope to conduct. It's up to you to decide if you think that that training might be necessary for you. There are, of course, opportunities to conduct research in med school and residencies, and that could be sufficient training for your needs, but there's never going to be a true replacement for hands-on experience, regardless of which path you choose to follow.3. Most MD-PhD programs (and particularly Medical Scientist Training Programs (MSTPs) - which are specially-funded and regulated by the NIH, these programs guarantee that your tuition and fees will be paid for for the duration of school, in addition to a cost-of-living stipend) start with your first two years of medical school (the preclinical years). After you take Step 1, you choose the lab in which you choose to conduct your dissertation studies, and spend the next 3-5 years doing your research and defending your thesis. Typically, you get to do a few rotations in labs during the summer between your first and second years, which should help you decide where you want to spend the next several years doing your research. Definitely take time deciding which labs you rotate with, since they'll more-or-less be your only options when it comes time to choose a lab.Source: am a current graduate student who works alongside several MSTP students. Feel free to ask any other questions you might have.#Just to add 2 cents. A lot of MDs who have their labs trained in times were medical school loans were SUBSTANTIALLY smaller. Nowadays it is doable, but not that easy to go for pure academic research as an MD since you have massive loans and academia gigs dont pay that much. MDPhD tuition coverage and stipend means you dont feel that pressure which i think is an immense plus.#I had a similar question. My undergraduate university has a good MD/PhD program associated with it and the administration in the MD/PhD program were more than happy to talk to me about it and connect me with current MD/PhD students. I really suggest you do this.1. The way my counselor broke it down, an MD/PhD will give you an advantage in getting grants and will help teach you how to be a good researcher. 2. Most people doing that kind of research are typically MD/PhD, that doesn't mean you can't, it will just be more difficult.3. Traditionally, you do your two academic years in med school, do your PhD, then come back and finish your clinical years in med school. It ends up being 8 years in most places (2 years med, 4 years grad, 2 years clinical). It depends on the institution though. You will interview with a bunch of labs you're interested in and you'll do rotations in labs in most places. If I were you, I'd start thinking about what you want to do as far as research. You have more flexibility the broader the department you want to do research in is (eg. Pitt has a ton of engineering research, so that would give you a lot of options). #Looks like others have addressed your questions pretty well. I recommend finding a few leaders in the big data field and seeing what their website bio/CV look like. Atul Butte is one that first comes to mind: http://buttelab.ucsf.eduIf you only want to do research, then pursue a PhD. If you want 80% research/20% clinic do an MD/PhD and go to school for free (2yrs pre clinical, 3-5 yrs PhD portion, 2 yrs clinical). It’s rare to find someone doing 50%/50%... from what I’ve gathered, you almost have to pick one. Financially it’s a wash because you lose 3-5 years of your future salary. If research is a minor interest, stick with the MD. #Would it be valuable for me to reach out to faculty in the schools I'm interested in?Or should I just stick to local peeps?#Excellent suggestion. I did this myself when I was considering MD/PhD programs and found it quite helpful#I like to start with my own school’s faculty so I get into a rhythm with the talks and get out some nerves. Then, I ask them to make an email introduction to faculty they know at other institutions. However, cold calling the specific faculty you’re interested in can also be successful. You just generally see a lower response rate to your emails. If your school has a career center, they should have resources on informational interviews and how to network successfully! #Plus, if you really like someone’s career path, you can make connections to their training program and start tailoring your application to that end. #Its definitely a good way to start networking

If you don't like it, that's one thing but to say that it's an awful language (though it has some flaws, like every language) is just wrong.#Ruby on Rails, Python, Node.js: lucky you!It does seem that most big data or other backend jobs use Java.  A lot of companies are stuck in the past.  You're lucky that they aren't still using Cobol!10+-year-old companies chose Java because, back then, the non-Java web servers and web frameworks were non-existent or slow/terrible (and often had to be hacked with C++ extensions, yikes!).  Now, most non-Java languages have reasonably capable, even good, web servers and web frameworks (no C++ needed).  Servers are faster and cheaper, JIT compilers exist and the language just doesn't matter as much in terms of performance.  Database performance tends to be the bottleneck and some of the non-Java web frameworks encourage BUT DON'T REQUIRE non-scalable but easy to use database strategies.  If you forgo these non-scalable database strategies and use/build a highly scalable one and do a good job on your database schema (or whatever is used in place of a schema), Java vs non-Java is a non-issue.But old programmers don't like to change so lots of new companies use Java.  And lots of Java pros will point out, quite correctly, that modern Java provides all of the clever features that non-Java languages have come up with.  Except that many companies don't use those clever features for various reasons (which is often because Java pros don't like to change and ""classic Java/JEE works just fine"").I've seen several Java projects delayed or die.  That's not fair because it's not Java's fault that lots of Java devs are slow, ignore modern Java advances and construct silly and errorprone Java architectures.  Lots of new companies choose Java out of tradition or machismo (""keep your toys out of my serious business!"").  Nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM and, these days, nobody ever lost funding or got laughed at for choosing Java.So, yes, I think that Java is used at a lot of jobs and the way that most companies use it is pretty awful but, if you want those jobs, it'd help to learn Java.Source: I did Java for 10+ years but I don't do it anymore.#Get off your high horse and head out of your ass. If being a java developer sucked so bad then there wouldn’t be many people employed as them. #If Java were so awful, why would so many ""good quality"" companies be using it? #Stop reading from wherever you get your language news. Stop believing every word you read/hear when someone talks about language X or framework Y.#I am sad ever time I have to use javascript wish we used gwt or vaadin. I think node.js is an abomination. Python is pointless and tiresome. Every one has their preferences. If you don't like java then a java job will suck. FOR YOU. Other people are very happy using java. On the other hand, you might enjoy spending some time with a grown-up language... Who knows?#I’ve never met anybody who hated java. IMO it’s object oriented ness is so heavy it makes you think OOP, plus it powers Android, and a lot of enterprise backends. #Completely agree. Feel like lack of strong typing makes node and interpreted apps oftentimes bad. I'm just hearing this from more than one mature developer.#I can see why using old java can suck but with streams and stuff now I actually enjoy coding in it. But it does annoy me when I'm working with someone and they do all this outdated stuff! #And enjoy it. #Stop being mean. It's reasonable when you hear from 3+ experienced developers that it's a possibility. That's why I'm asking, because I'm not sure. I'm not saying that it is bad, I'm just asking. #Use typescript#> It's reasonable when you hear from 3+ experienced developers that it's a possibility. Possibility of what?    >... is the language so awful that it should absolutely be avoided at all costs...  ... kinda implies at least a base level of ""badness"".#Possibility that it's bad. It's reasonable to assert that it could be really bad, when so many people openly hate it. I never hear such hate for Ruby or Python or Golang, like I have with Java. It doesn't seem to me personally like it is that bad. Good to hear that a lot of you don't feel that way #I get laughed at every time I say I like Python. I mean, in real life. :[. I think Ruby gets a lot of the same guff (for the same reasons).#Haha before my grad job a couple of years back I got laughed at during the interview process for saying I wanted to get into python"

Machine Learning is a great field! Many companies, tech and not tech, are looking into and investing heavily into ML since the influx of Data being everywhere.The field is growing quickly and lots of smart people from different backgrounds are doing some cool work. Im very interested in the models and algorithms of ML so that is something you could look into. If you are a student then get involved in a ML lab on campus.Good luck!#Do something in machine learning. You can probaly pick up python quick. Or use Groovy to script since it just sits on Java. Just learn something. #The typical specifications are: IT, dev ops, mobile dev, web dev, UI/UX, backend dev, data science/analytics, testing, IoT project dev, game dev, roboticsThe buzz word careers are: data science/big data, machine learning/neural networks/deep learning/AI, cryptocurrency/blockchain, AR or VR, quantum computing, robotics, fintech (/r/algotrading). Some people glamorize game dev, or whatever they're doing, whatever you think sounds cool you should try to pursue#cloud deployments and infrastructure as code#Container orchestration and data visualization are supposedly high demand skills atm. I'm not sure I'd call either interesting when stacking it up against hot tech like ML, but you can do some pretty cool shit if you know docker and kubernetes#Possibly because it's very difficult to get into those fields without a grad degree#Every AI discpline depends on ML. You need to train statistical vision and language models for them to work as intended. It's become a core subject in CS and one of the more useful subjects. At my school there are huge waiting lists for multiple 200 person sections for ML courses.#Thanks for the answer! I need to come to a company which either does something related to what I know or will be able to introduce me to something.Machine learning indeed sounds interesting.How is Go doing actually? Is it getting embraced in the industry?#You need a bachelors for data science#Go to a company that does data marketing. PM me and I can give you some names or a company that does SEO, they do neat things. Not sure about GO, besides Google.

They plan political assassinations and they spy on every day Americans without a warrant. They blackmail important politicians and public figures after entrapping them so they can control them. They have experimented on unsuspecting US citizens with illicit drugs, mental abuse, sexual abuse, and torture to try to find mind control drugs. They took in Nazis and Japanese scientists researching nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons so we could develop them ourselves. They control the media through operation mockingbird. Oh. And they might have murdered a president.Once a country is destabilized, the military uses it as an excuse to build more missles to blow shit up and rebuild what they just blew up.

Wellington;859dyw;1521349970.0;/r/Wellington/comments/859dyw/looking_for_it_work_in_wellington/;Looking for IT work in Wellington;"I'm going to be moving to Wellington as of 4th April and wondered if anyone had any tips for me on finding work in the IT industry in Wellington. My experience in the UK IT sector was working within a large government departments data & analytics team. I have experience in SAS, R, shell scripting and Python (much less experience than the aforementioned skills). In my previous role I did a lot of continuous improvement work on live running data services and would love to continue this kind of role or better yet develop my career further down the ""Big Data"" path.I have a bachelor's degree in Network Computing that has gave me a good foundation for picking up new tech or programming languages. In my spare time I dabble in very amateur game design/development.I'm looking to further develop my coding skills as I genuinely enjoy my work. The satisfaction of finding a resolution to an existing issue or problem is wonderful. I've already reached out to multiple recruitment agencies, have contacted some companies that people I've met on the road have mentioned and have a few ongoing enquiries. Any pointers, tips or nudges in the right direction would be appreciated. Thank you in advance for any help. ";"Hey, so I'm not employed as an analyst or anything to do with big data, but that's the avenue that I'm gunning for, so I've done a little bit of research. There seem to be lots of opportunities for this kind of thing in Wellington (hence why I'm trying to get into the field). In addition to an apparent dearth of data analysts in Wellington (or maybe even business analysts given your SAS knowledge?), all of the large government analyst groups are based here. Search for some keywords on seek.co.nz specifically in Wellington, and see what you find. [Here's an example](https://www.seek.co.nz/job/35729304) of a job listing that I was looking at earlier, which seems to suit your background. That's just one I found after literally minutes of looking. Like I said, take my opinions with a grain of salt, because I'm only hoping to get into this field versus actually having first-hand experience - nevertheless, it seems that you could have chosen far worse parts of the world to try and get a job with your skillset.#A couple more to check out would be Flux (part of Powershop) who have a large dev team- also qrious - a venture “no longer a startup” owned by Spark is one of NZ largest analytics firms as well - good luck... plenty of ex-pat UK types here so you will be in great company.... #Public Sector is generally awash with both permament and fixed term analyst roles, and they are generally all SAS shops running on Oracle servers  so you'll need some basic SQL knowledge to join and extract data from the warehouse, but nothing too complicated. In addition to Seek, there is also jobs.govt.nzFor the private sector, Loyalty NZ (in their LAB360 division), Xero and Trademe (although they are apparently starting to move away from SAS) are the biggest hirers.  BNZ as well assuming they haven't decided to sack everyone that week.Contracting opportunities abound as well, I had barely 2 years experience as a data analyst fresh from uni before I was able to score my first very nice hourly rate contract. If you do want to try recruiters, my personal experience in Wellington was that Hays (Gary Dean) and Hudson (Peter Sing) were the best, both in terms of jobs available and thier effectiveness.  Beyond Recruitment always have a good range, but found them quite slack and slow.#Not often mentioned but possibly worth a look: Stuff.co.nz (the company formerly known as Fairfax). I've been working there for the last 5 months and I quite like it. Not sure if there are any jobs posted, but we've had a few technology team members leave over the last while so there might be some openings. We're not heavy into analytics yet, but the operative word is ""yet"". There's definitely an interest for us to start moving that direction. #Thank you for the advice. It's cool that you're trying to get into the field, it's definitely an exciting role to be in as our world becomes more and more reliant on data and how it can be used.I did specifically decide that Wellington would be a good place for me considering my government background so the validation is appreciated. That's a solid find as well. Most the roles I reached out to recruitment agencies regarding I found on seek.co.nz but somehow that specific one slipped through my net. You'd think someone with data analysis experience would be good at key word searches...#That sounds interesting, I'll take a look into them. I've currently got some ongoing enquiries with a few companies so fingers crossed I can find somewhere.I'm looking forward to getting back into a working routine, happy for that to be with anyone, everyone I've met in New Zealand since arrival has been lovely, but a few familiar accents never go amiss.#Great to hear that you were able to get contracting opportunities at 2 years experience as that's about where I am at so would love to do work as a contractor to add some more breadth to my CV.The name drops of specific recruiters is topper too, I'll take a look at there details and get in touch with my own. Never know what might turn up from it after all.It'd be good to do some private sector work too to add a bit more variety to my work experience than public sector work so thanks for noting BNZ's self destructive tendency, I'll keep it in mind if I ever have to make a split decision.Quick question, feel free not to answer as it's obviously personal. How much would you consider a nice hourly rate contract at the 2 years experience mark? Again, no need to answer if that's too personal for you.#Nice little insight there. Appreciate it. I'll be taking a look into openings and if I don't see any I might call up anyways to enquire deeper about it.Would be super interesting to get in on the ground level with a company as they're starting to use more data analytics to improve the overall service offered.#Don’t forget to check jobs.govt.nz. #Oh, and hope you are thick skinned - we love bagging a losing pommie sporting team -  ) #I got $75 an hour plus GST as my first contract rate.   My last one before I made the jump to Aussie was $120 p/h with a bonus if certain deadlines and goals were met.However, my general rule is that I half whatever my hourly rate is as my ""take home pay"" - you have to pay your own tax and ACC, you don't get annual leave so I leave 8% aside which is the equivalent of the 4 weeks you'd get in a salaried position and you have to pay your own Kiwisaver (super).  Not saying you're still not well ahead of what you'd get as a salaried man, but you also can't look at the raw rate figure and immediately put the deposit down on your new superyacht.If you're after the public sector, my personal preference is to look for positions that will allow you to do IDI work.   Generally playing with just one agencies data gets stale after awhile. *edit*For reference - the funnest uber set of data on earth to play with - http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/snapshots-of-nz/integrated-data-infrastructure/idi-data.aspx#Bagging? Isn't beating us enough? I hope whatever team I'm on doesn't lose, I really don't want to have to run on back to little ol' Newcastle with my tail between my legs. Fearful or not, I'll see you out there.#I didn't even think about loss of annual leave. Oh how sheltered I've been in public sector. After being on the road for 7 months now I'm sure I can forego it for a little while.Thanks for the advice on contracting though, maybe someday even with having to do my own taxes and such I can be a superyachting big money contractor. Maybe not though, I can get pretty seasick if the seas are rough.Good to note about IDI work as well, I remember before leaving home starting to feel similarly stagnant looking at similar data most days."

Compare it to, say, web app dev world where you have all sorts of solutions,  some very elegant, up and down the value chain -- from lambda-style functions in the cloud to full-on web-based app dev 'frameworks' like anvil and bubble, and everything in between.am i wrong?;"Calling it ""big data' shows you don't understand it, there's no ""big data"", there are various problem where one deals with above-average requirements in terms of data size, performance or data complexity and for some reason people like to lump them into ""big data"".Personally I think the ""big data"" environment is amazing, at least for my ""big data"", but my ""big data"" usually consists of hundreds of billions of low granularity bid logs... and the way I handle that is column stores.If your ""big data"" consists of analyzing the text from hundreds of millions of webpages, I wouldn't recommend that as a solution, I would recommend getting a very fast statistics-focused language like Julia and finding a highly parallelizable LDA library.Maybe you ""big data"" consists of semi-formatted data, outputs from some boxes that had 20 different log formats over the year and can contain thousands of fields and sometime it's the same name but a different meaning and data type... well, than you could go use something like ScyllaDb or Es to analyze that entanglement.And that's just some completely different problems that fall under ""big data"" based on data type, each of those datasets could be treated in 100 different ways depending on what you want to get from it.The ""Big data"" ecosystem is ****ing amazing, in what other fields are top-level companies open sourcing their database, languages, libraries and frameworks made specifically for this domain ?  Maybe ML... but modern ML is very intertwined with ""Big data""#> web app dev worldFirst off general purpose web apps have much greater scope than big data.  It isn't a remotely fair comparison.  The web in 1994 probably had more developers than big data does today certainly by 1996.  I don't think the state of big data tools is much different than the web in the mid 1990s.  A much fairer comparison would be specialized vertical technologies.  Say for example languages and tools for programming SDN.  #You're not entirely wrong, but it's unfair to say that ""big data technologies are shitty"". Big Data is a state, not a trend or whatever you think it is. A state that can vary and change, and it does so a lot. The field is growing fast and tools are getting deprecated a year after they are used in production. But it's not true to say that it's all that bad. NiFi, spark streaming, Fluentd, Kafka are just a sliver of great technologies used today, which I'm quite familiar with some, and less familiar with others. It's like saying the databases field is shitty because people are using ElasticSearch for storing sales data.#From my experience it is because most of the data scientists are not software engineers and most software engineers are not data scientists. This leads to the problem that the systems are usually sh*tty scripts being run somehow in sort of automatic way.Also the data science and machine learning fields is progressing so fast that software.engineers.have trouble following the needs of the data scientists.#> web app dev world where you have all sorts of solutions, some very elegantFirst of all, most web app dev solutions have some kind of architectural limitation (usually scalability), and have taken literally 30 years of development to get to where they are now, from the days of writing cgi-bin scripts in C.Also, each single component of a big data stack is usually more complex than a web framework, more like a high performance, fully featured webserver.>  incredible complexity, low-quality or at least fragile/low-resilience software/systems/configuration, etcThere's some truth to this, but the ecosystem is evolving. In addition, it is *necessarily* fragmented, as to achieve the right type of performance and robustness, tools need to be targeted to a specific set of tradeoffs.Finally, if you look at commercially sponsored open source offerings like elasticsearch (notably NOT a consulting company), that stuff is as professional grade as you would expect.Incidentally, the consulting companies are partly to blame here - they create ""me too"" tools and have no incentive to make anything easy to use. #Because:   * the simplest and easiest solutions can be extremely expensive to run when you're talking about processing many billions of rows per day   * big data pipelines, complex data, and analytics are far more complex than web development   * there's still a lot of fairly new bits that are still maturing: airflow, kafka, redshit, etc   * some components are locked in vendor struggles that seem to retard progress: hadoop   * others promise the world: spark, and 80% of what's out there#A few reasons:* There's a lot of NIH (not invented here) and companies create their own instead of improving an existing one* Big Data is [way more complex](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/on-complexity-in-big-data) than small data* These are general purpose tools and its difficult to make an easy one for all things Big Data* There's a bunch of people's PhD thesis in these projects and that code is (generally) terrible* These projects aren't that old or mature* There's a newer and better thing on the horizon and I'm going to work on that instead of improving the one I'm using now#Let's be clear-- ""Big Data"" is a fuck boy term that was introduced by some fucking dipshits fresh out of their computer science class, because they wanted to play pretend pioneer. every generation believes that they made something up, and because they call it something different than the previous name, they're the creators now. Reading and sorting information has been around for decades. Data logic is data logic, there's no spoonfeeding available to those that have no purpose in the game.#> Calling it ""big data' shows you don't understand itTHANK YOU.  As I was reading the post, I was preparing to reply with the exact same thing.#I understand where you are coming from, but I also understand where the OP is coming from as well. The “Big Data” ecosystem in general is full of buzzword jargon that suits seems to gobble up like a chinese buffet. The same is happening with ML and Blockchain. Throw in a couple keywords about “big data” and you can sell a product better to the higher ups. They have no clue what it is, but they have heard about it on CNN so it must be good and they should get some in their company too! Otherwise their company might be left behind. At a more development level, there are too many tools that have such a close overlap with each other, but they all have so many little nuances, the only people that can use it are the people that are intimately aware of the actual tool itself. I couldn’t throw in some data Cassandra and then allow someone to go query in it to do a little digging like I could a RDBS. I would be overwhelmed with questions of “why does this not work, why does X not work? Why does it do this? Why is this so slow?!” Then I have to explain why it fits and works well for one case but not another. But when you are dealing with “analysts” that are used to querying a db and pulling that data into tableau because it gives them a quick UI, it’s hard to make an argument to use a tool that isn’t as “general purpose”. The other thing that drives me up the wall is all of the spin off tools. Want some analytic processing framework? What you want? Flink, Spark, Storm, Samza, Kinesis on AWS? Again they all fill a small niche that wins some benchmark to have a claim to fame for some small use-case.While I agree that calling a 100MB csv file is stupid, I’m not going to say the big data ecosystem doesn’t have massive problems with interoperability, niche products, and fragmentation of products that do essentially the same thing.

Did it just make it so there wasn't any practical use for the information taught?#Projects were useless and the teacher trys to teach abstract concepts with nothing but lectures and her heavy accent. #That blows. Guess i'll drop that and take *477 with Owen, then.#That's a better move, I took 476 and liked it much better #I wouldn't take 477 with Owen.  I'm one of the ulas for the class and it's all super outdated stuff.  440 is better than 477.  431 is super useful for interviews and just interesting overall.  Plus if ofria teaches it again he is one of if not the best Prof I've had#Glad you like the class!  I'll be teaching it again in the Fall, but probably not the Spring.  Of course, Sebnem Onsay is slated to teach it in the Spring and we have already been talking to make sure the class goes just as well for her!#Which electives would you recommend, then? The ones I know I want to take are 422 (Computer Networks) and 431 (Alg Engineering).Then, out of the ones I found interesting:* CSE 425 - Intro to computer security* CSE 440 - Intro to AI* CSE 476 - Mobile App Dev* CSE 477 - Web App Dev* CSE 480 - Database systems (not sure about this with no web dev experience though)* CSE 482 - Big Data Analysisedit:and maybe CSE 450 (Translation of Programming Languages)#I haven't taken any of those other than 440 and 477.  I did 402, 431, 460 and 450 and am in 491, 802 and 847 now.  450 (compilers) was pretty interesting.  Anything taught by Nahum is worth taking in my opinion (480 and 450). I've heard 480 is a bit work intensive but worth taking and that's how I found compilers to be.  Big Data is a useful feild right now but I haven't taken the class so I don't know how good it would be.  476 is slightly outdated but not as badly out of date as 477. In general web Dev and app Dev are pretty easy to learn on your own and constantly changing so I would avoid them if possible.  I've heard only bad things about security here as it's really theoretically based and boring.  460 is 260 continued so if you liked 260 it's more of the same.#How was 440? And I think I might take 450, but I'll have to push it till senior year because I'd like to take 335 and 431 in the fall but 450 is only in the fall too I guess.#It was solidly okay.  Not too hard but not a blowoff.  Interesting topics but no applications of them. The professor was Dr. Chai who was nice but covered topics a little too slowly to be super interesting. If I had to start over I would probably take something else but it's not a bad option by any means#431 and 450 are both quite a bit of coding, so it is probably a good idea not to take them both in the same semester.  They're both classes that I originally setup (this is Charles Ofria), but Josh Nahum has done some really great improvements to 450.  If I teach it again (which is reasonably likely in Fall 2019) I'll probably shift to Josh's setup as my starting point.

This job is full time and is aimed at recent college grads. I graduated with a  BS in Math and BS in Comp Sci. I have minimal experience and have taken 1 Database class where I learned some basic SQL and database design. The listing is basically just asking for a bachelors degree but then says after a year in this program, the candidate will essentially be promoted to one of the following: **business analyst, data engineer, or big data engineer**. I want to learn more, while i am applying, about technologies relevant to these. I feel like often times when i see job postings, I just see a large list of technologies/languages that may be specific to the company or infrastructure being used by said company. I'm not sure what are the common technologies used across most of these (**business analyst, data engineer, or big data engineer**) jobs. I find it easy to find a listing that says you need to know x,y, & z. Then I go to another listing for the same job and they say you need to know a,b,c. 1. Is there a road map or concise guide so I know what I need to learn? What common technologies and or languages are used across these professions?2. What is core to these professions and where/how can I learn them? Does anyone here have any resources that are relevant to these professions? In short I guess I'm just trying to understand exactly what I really need to learn to be successful in these jobs and what resources/road maps are available?;the tech stack is really dependent on the company, of course. speaking from experience in big data, i can tell you about some trends right now:Languages: Python, Scala, **SQL**, JavaTech: Hadoop (HDFS), Hive/Spark, Kafka, HBase, Impala, etc.I recommend looking at [this free e-book](https://www.jesse-anderson.com/books/the-ultimate-guide-to-switching-careers-to-big-data/). It was a great starting point for me. If you get this job (and you decide on the engineering route), a top priority you should have is to mingle with the data engineers and ask them what tech they use, then getting familiar with those techs.Honestly, just read that book. That guy has the right idea. Obviously he's advertising his classes, but the information in that short book is pretty high quality.#business analyst = show fancy pie charts to execsdata engineer = do manual preprocessing of data that doesn't crash your excelbig data engineer = do manual preprocessing of data that crashes your excel using super advanced tools that are way overkill and would honestly work just fine in a normal MySQL database if you bothered to configure it properly Those names mean nothing at all. At one company you are a data analyst, at another a business analyst, at another a developer, at a third a machine learning expert while doing the EXACT same work.You have to look at the technologies involved and do some reconnaissance and find out wtf they are doing and what kind of data they might have and go from there.#high school politics
TillSverige;85pujj;1521517998.0;/r/TillSverige/comments/85pujj/dreaming_of_sverige/;Dreaming of Sverige;Me 33m and my SO, 27f, with our two children 7m and 1f are looking to move to Sweden in the next ten years or so. Jobs are hard here because retail/customer service are hard to move up in. I've spent the last year trying to learn Swedish, and I know I have extended family in Jönkoping in but I haven't kept up with them.I currently work in a job much like Bisnode, big Data for companies (credit reporting, industry/financial speculation) and am feeling discouraged. She wants to homestead and live mostly a farm-type life with livestock and gardening while I want to work, but I'm not skilled and have no degree outside of completing all of high school (grade 12) and some University. I am very fit and strong as we live and work on a farm here in Texas as well as our regular desk jobs.Do we have a chance if we look for jobs online? I'm worried that Sverige is not very farming-friendly and she won't be able to fulfill her dreams. We want to live in Sweden as it seems, based on all of what we've learned iver the years, that we'd fit better there socially than in most places here in the US.Any advice, constructive or dissuasive, is welcome. Tack på förhand!;"Can't give you any pointers on finding a job but farming is my jam.First off, sweden is a pretty big country and the type off agricultural you will be doing will depend on share you end up. Southern sweden will give you more oppurtunity and yield larger harvests. Keeping livestock is something you can do no matter where you end up however. First thing to keep in mind when keeping livestock in Sweden is thehigh standard of animal welfare laws.If you have little experience with farming and want a good place to start at, pigs are the way to go.Pigs can be raised almost anywhere, they are easy to care for and yield allt of meat compared to the work you put in. First thing to do is to read up and the laws concering farming here in Sweden. If you have any questions about the laws feel free to pm me.#Don't know any specifics regarding your area of expertise, but in general high-tech specialists are fairly sought after.  Degrees (or lack thereof) only really tends to matter when you're looking for you first job (which specialist jobs rarely are). But after that it's all about previous work, so if you got good references from your current employer that can go a long way.Your biggest issue will probably be finding a company willing to set up an interview with you, you being on the other side of the globe and all. And you *need* to have the job landed before you move here. It's a criteria for getting a work visa.  You can't come here on a tourist visa and start looking for a job. That'll get you kicked out as far as I understand.  So start job hunting first, think of the the rest later is my advice. Another issue might be if you also need to find an employer who's willing to let you work remotely. Big data tends to mean high info security, meaning work on site only. Can perhaps be hard to combine with homesteading. Not impossible, but might cut down your job opportunities.  For programmer/IT/high-tech jobs in general working remotely is often acceptable, as long as you can come in to the office every so often. Varies greatly between companies though. Make sure you got that cleared before you accept a job (if you are going the homesteading route that is).On the topic of homesteading, please be aware that we're quite far north up here, the winters are long and the growing season short. It takes some skill. And it takes *a lot of time*, so I imagine it'll be quite a challenge to combine with full-time employment.  But then again, I'm no homesteader so I'm not really an authority on that.  [Here's a good Swedish homesteading channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7GkLSNBmds1DZit_oHk-Fg) you can check out to get a better idea if what's ahead of you if you choose that path.#Hello! I'm glad you want to move here! :)This is just my experiences growing up on the countryside, so take it with a grain of salt.Farming is currently in a pretty rapid decline in Sweden, compared to just 60 years ago. This is because of a number of reasons. Competing markets in the EU, the cost of staying on top of all rules and regulations, low prices on produce, etc.Small towns are experiencing a ""youth drain"" where a lot of young people are moving to the city (like me), leaving the towns with mostly old people and families.BUTThis means that property and land is cheaper than ever in the rural areas. And the communities there are often very welcoming. Farms are also eligable for a lot of EU grants that help out a lot when it comes to money. I've seen some ""amish"" farms that seem pretty viable, and some farms focus on B&B and café-style models with local produce. It's not going to be easy at first, but certainly not impossible. One option is to live close to a city, and drive to work, but have small farm too. You Texans seem to drive like 3 hours just to get some groceries, and then back again, so a little commute is probably not a big deal. Something to be aware of is the winter.You wrote that you're from Texas. Well, up here we get lots and lots and lots of snow. And if you live on a farm/rural area, you have to shovel it away to even be able to take the car anywhere. Also, the darkness is crushing. 4-5 hours of sunlight a day can really get to you if you're not prepared.I hope this helped, and ask away if you have any questions. I can check with my family how the financial situation looks out there with farming in mind.#Your safest and most likely option is for one of you two to study a Master's degree in Sweden and apply to bring the family with you. That information can be found on migrationsverket.se. I am a student in Sweden from Minnesota. Because I don't have any special skills or IT skills, this is the only plausible way I can get into Sweden before finding a job. Otherwise, it is true. You cannot come to Sweden to job search. However with a student permit, you may work and find a job that will offer you a work visa. If you find a work visa within 6 months of graduating school, you can stay as long as your work visa is valid (as long as you have work). All that information is on migrationsverket.se#The information about needing a job first is what I've heard but not confirmed before, so I'm glad to know for sure.If we do get to emigrate, it will have to be close by a city where I can commute for sure. The short growing season will be a struggle I think, but having livestock to tend year round will be something to keep us occupied in the long winter, I hope.I really appreciate your help, and I'm absolutely checking out that channel!#Down here in Skåneland we don't have ""lots and lots and lots of snow"", and plenty of farms.#Thank you very, very much for the information. I have more hope now than before, for sure. We've been looking into Agro-tourism too, where we have a working farm and host school children, like minded families, and curious tourists as well, so with your B&B style suggestion that may be something to look at too.Driving and winter I don't think will be as much of a problem, but the darkness is definitely going to be something we'll struggle with, as well as a short growing season. We grow crops here from March till October so we're going to have to get used to that as well. I'm glad to hear the rural communities are welcoming, we've grown quite used to friendly rural people here in Texas, haha.Again, tack så mycket! It really brightens my day to start planning ahead for the struggles we will likely face.#Very true!#Yeah, the sun being basically gone during midwinter and always up during midsummer can take some getting used to.I would recommend spending some holiday time here, both during early January (new years perhaps) and late June (midsummer party!) to get a feel for what it's like.If nothing else, it's a good way to test the waters before you commit to coming over permanently. :)Also, Sweden is quite long north/south-wise. The difference between southern and northern Sweden is quite large in terms of sun-hours.The very north of Sweden is above the polar circle, up there the sun doesn't rise at all for about a week or so midwinter (and never sets midsummer).  Southern Sweden isn't nearly as extreme."

What makes it different than what they are fighting for?Yeah, this really sums it up. We're not trying to ""show it"" to the SJWs. We're trying to bring forth a set of moral and ethical values we believe that SJWs either never had, or have abandoned, as well as fight against the SJW's failures in moral and ethical values.Any amount of ethical or moral compromise completely subverts any semblance of moral or ethical highground.And that's really the crux of the issue. We're no better than the SJWs when we bring emotion into a fight. We also don't win when we give up on the idea of rules for everyone. Why? Because those are supposed to be our major cruxes on which we take issue with SJWs. If we oppose the SJW's misuse of emotion to write laws, how can we in the same breathe do the same? If we oppose the SJW's violation of rights, which are essentially laws, how can we in the same breath violate rules that we had agreed to.Welcome to being the good guys.

Academia, media, and business are full of authoritarian leftists, and the general population isn't exactly far behind.#It's literally the *only* way you can get these people stop trying to ruin other people's lives over tweets.Imagining that you can stop a culture war without winning it is delusional. Neo Marxists will never, ever stop attacking you.#""Eye for an eye makes the whole world blind"" is one of the most logically retarded statements I've ever encountered.#The reason you *do* use SJW tactics is the same reason we haven't had a nuclear war. If Russia were the only country in the world with nuclear bombs, do you think they wouldn't have used them by now? Mutually assured destruction is how you take truly destructive behavior off the table for everyone.#Never said it was that eye for an eye quote though #OP, this strategy only works when you can effectively annihilate each other with overwhelming force and little effort. The ""Mexican Standoff"" strategy is fine with only overwhelming force. You'll note that the Russians *haven't* used nuclear weapons, this is because the price of victory in a nuclear exchange is so high, that there is no reason to try. This is not how SJW tactics work. It's an *aggressive* tactic, but not truly scorched Earth. Their attacks leave people, and sometimes their attacks are so aggressive they make the target look *better*. Jordan Peterson & Bret Weinstein, like them or not, are almost perfect examples of someone being attacked *so aggressively* that the force is seen as unjustified, and instead their messages are *redoubled* **because** of the attacks. Mythicist Milwaukee is another example. A Mexican Standoff approach only works if both sides are *equally* armed, and victory is devastating to both sides, so that they *refuse* to take action. The fact that SJWs *regularly* take action tells us that that a Mexican Standoff approach won't work.SJW attacks, and the left's political establishment use of meta data is not violent enough to be a Mexican Standoff. Instead, if you take a page out of the left's own book ""Rules For Radicals"", you see that what is happening is that the SJWs attacks are self-destructive. Meanwhile, the Sinclair metadata is mostly just something that is *already* standard operating policy for political organizations.#You didn't have to. Our entire legal system is based on the concept of eye for an eye. We discharge our vengeance to the state. That doesn't mean it doesn't happen. And when it starts not happening, things get real ugly in a hurry for the state.#And we ""don't resort to terrorism to defeat terrorism"" because that, too, is a different situation from SJW bullshit. I mean if we're reaching for metaphors here, everyone gets to be stupid.Also, tell the people who have been ruined by the SJW playbook that it isn't ""scorched earth"".Also also, I have no idea why you think SJW behavior isn't in direct accordance with Alinsky. Seems a 100% backwards comprehension.#>And we ""don't resort to terrorism to defeat terrorism"" because that, too, is a different situation from SJW bullshit. I mean if we're reaching for metaphors here, everyone gets to be stupid.I use that metaphor because copying tactics of your enemies is not necessarily the best option. There are reasons why you don't copy tactics. Sometimes they don't work with your forces, sometimes they aren't useful for your goals, and sometimes they even weaken your own position. Which is why you don't try to fight terrorism with terrorism.>Also, tell the people who have been ruined by the SJW playbook that it isn't ""scorched earth"".I have no problem with that.

conspiracy;85snyk;1521552220.0;/r/conspiracy/comments/85snyk/when_operations_like_cambridge_analytica_was/;When operations like Cambridge Analytica was considered smart campaigning.;[How Obama’s Team Used Big Data to Rally Voters](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/509026/how-obamas-team-used-big-data-to-rally-voters/)> In the 2008 presidential election, Obama’s targeters had assigned every voter in the country a pair of scores based on the probability that the individual would perform two distinct actions that mattered to the campaign: casting a ballot and supporting Obama. These scores were derived from an unprecedented volume of ongoing survey work. For each battleground state every week, the campaign’s call centers conducted 5,000 to 10,000 so-called short-form interviews that quickly gauged a voter’s preferences, and 1,000 interviews in a long-form version that was more like a traditional poll. To derive individual-level predictions, algorithms trawled for patterns between these opinions and the data points the campaign had assembled for every voter—as many as one thousand variables each, drawn from voter registration records, consumer data warehouses, and past campaign contacts.[How the Obama campaign won the race for voter data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-obama-campaign-won-the-race-for-voter-data/2013/07/28/ad32c7b4-ee4e-11e2-a1f9-ea873b7e0424_story.html?utm_term=.7e0cc2313daa)> Early in 2011, some Obama operatives visited Facebook, where executives were encouraging them to spend some of the campaign’s advertising money with the company. “We started saying, ‘Okay, that’s nice if we just advertise,’ ” Messina said. “But what if we could build a piece of software that tracked all this and allowed you to match your friends on Facebook with our lists, and we said to you, ‘Okay, so-and-so is a friend of yours, we think he’s unregistered, why don’t you go get him to register?’ Or ‘So-and-so is a friend of yours, we think he’s undecided. Why don’t you get him to be decided?’ And we only gave you a discrete number of friends. That turned out to be millions of dollars and a year of our lives. It was incredibly complex to do.” What a difference a few years can make! What was once considered smart campaigning has morphed into something illegal. I wonder what changed the perception of the press? ;No one said that was illegal. But, I'm pretty sure entrapping and blackmailing people is illegal. #A lot changed technically between 2008 and 2015 and what CA was able to do went way deeper. Also there is the whole fake news influx that wouldn't have been as effective if they never had the data from CA. Not to mention the other underhanded shit they admitted to in these videos, more of which is about to be revealed in coming days. The next step in political influence is definitely what CA and companies like it are doing, and you can be sure the other side is going to be using that cutting edge tech as well. The difference going forward will be disclosure of how the data is used. They'll just put it in the terms of use and keep doing what they're doing. #CA damage control crew in full effect today.#Its a disgusting tactic and its shameful that we've accepted this as the status quo.#This. Also, unsure of what CA did for the Obama campaign, but for Trump - CA posed as a third-party to acquire users data through a guise of a game/app within Facebook, and did not disclose in the Terms and Conditions of using that app that they were going to use the user's data and share that data outside of Facebook. While laws in the US are relatively lax here, they violated Facebook's ToS, and broke many laws in the EU. #I know, right? #You accept it every time you log into social media. #I'm pretty sure the Obama campaign wasn't involved with CA. They definitely did whatever was at their disposal at the time technically to sway opinions online though. The difference between how an Obama and Trump campaign would operate is night and day. Trump tends to break the law first and throw money at it later. Obama and his people are all high level lawyers that are way too competent to not cover their tracks at every turn. Same reason why the Clintons will never go to jail. They make sure before hand that every move they make to enrich themselves is completely legal.   #I always assume any app that I use is collecting my data. Even keyboard apps collect data. Everything is collecting data so if you don’t want your data collected, don’t use any apps, social media, “personality tests”, etc.#Was CA's use of data from Facebook and other social media outlets: Illegal, against the TOS of the sites, or out of the ordinary? Ill save you the itme, the answer is no. Now back to sucking off David Brock for pizza vouchers. #Yup - I hope something that comes out of this when the dust settles are strong laws around privacy and consumer protection on the internet. More in line with EU Standards. Not holding my breath - Congress can barely get a budget together to fund themselves, let alone make policy.

ITCareerQuestions;89pfc8;1522848372.0;/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/89pfc8/is_a_masters_in_it_worth_it/;Is a masters in IT worth it?;I already have 7 years work experience as a reporting/BI/database analyst with a BBA from a state school. My goal is to become a fully fledged business intelligence/data/big data engineer, as my passion is anything related to data and databases (relational and otherwise).My original plan was to supplement my BBA with certifications from the local community college in database development to show that I have the technical skill. That plan fell through since the scheduling won't ever work while working FT. The only credible option I've found is a masters in IT that focuses on BI/DB development along with some big data courses. My other option is to learn as much as I can through MOOCs and continue working on vendor certs. Obviously this will be cheaper but not near as credible. Couple other things:1.) Cost of the masters will be 28K2.) Already have $22K in debt for my BBA3.) Masters includes a litany of courses that I am very interested in. Almost no fluff. 4.) School is actually pretty well regarded in the metroplex I live in. 5.) I have a wife, toddler, and a mortgage. So doing any drastic or risky moves is out of range for now. 6.) Employer will not pay for any of the masters (small healthcare company). I'm also afraid I'm competing in a well saturated field, so it makes me wonder about the ROI on the masters degree. What should I do?;"I don't think it's going to be worth the ROI, especially if you are hesitant to move around. Experience is going to be more valuable than education is, and while it might help you move up a bit quicker... I can't imagine that it will be easy to juggle that while working and having a little one.#Rule of thumbs here 1.  Any masters that isn't a top 10 should be paid for by your company so you aren't worried about ROI. 2.  You get a masters when you're told you need one to move upIf you're looking for additional items to throw on to your resume look at [edX](https://www.edx.org) and the micromasters / cert programs. They're cheaper, faster, and respected. #>My other option is to learn as much as I can through MOOCs and continue working on vendor certs. Obviously this will be cheaper but not near as credible. What leads you to believe this is the case?MOOCs/Vendor certs tend to be more up-to-date in terms of content and industry direction. Frankly, previous working experience in $technology is going to trump either the MBA or a MOOC either way, so why pay more?#Here is my 2 cents, I am no analyst but it seems to me like the amount of debt you will put yourself in with going after a masters and no increase in salary or is there? If a company is asking for it and you plan to most likely get a  raise then id say maaaybe. Perhaps a potential employer is willing to pay for the masters...in that case then I wouls day go for it. If expereince will outweigh the masters degree then don't do it. Experience is key.#Move around geographically, or in another way?So if it isn't worth the ROI, what credential will make me more competitive, in addition to experience? #Otherwise don't do it? Are there really employers out there that pay for them?#See, I was thinking either edX or Coursera. Coursera is cheaper and I like the courses. EdX has one cert specifically for Big Data through Microsoft that probably would prep me for an MCSA. Cost is $900 bucks though. #I meant move around between companies. You said you want to make sure you have very stable income, or at least that's how I took it.I'm not an analyst or BI guy, but I do a lot of big data stuff. What kind of work do you do, analyzing the actual data, or helping engineer how it's held and accessed?#> Otherwise don't do it What's the reasoning otherwise? Nobody is telling you that you need it and you're signing up for debt. Experience and the risk taking are probably what hold your income back. > Are there really employers out there that pay for them?I work in a fortune 100 and they'll reimburse up to 15k per year for education depending on the program. #My $.02...  I don't understand how you're talking about debt of a masters while simultaneously seem hesitant to pull the trigger on a micromasters or certification that costs less than one course of a masters.#Actually both. I help develop reports and dashboards with our BI tool and our ERP, and I also help build data marts for new reporting that doesn't exist. Within the next 6 months (probably sooner) the maintenance of the data warehouse will be my responsibility. I also am our ""data guy"" that everyone goes to in order to decipher data and or data types. And I wouldn't mind switching companies if the situation was better. I make a very comfortable salary and have access to any project I want to work on, since I'm at a smaller company. #Because of the funding source. I could get student loans for the masters to offset the initial cash outlay compared to the other options that are a direct cash outflow unless I use a credit card.#My guy, you need to save not go into more debt. Don't treat this like a casino. It might pay off, it might not. Also, these [microsoft academy programs](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/) offer a verified cert from edX for $99.#That's per course. The cert if $990 for the one in big data. And you're right, I need to save, not go into debt. What I am having a hard time is choosing Coursera (that has both DWing and Big Data) or the Microsoft program through EdX which focuses only on big data.#In general I believe the breakdown is EdX > Coursera > Udacity and it's reflective in the official programs.

Normally, with a typical user, with a singular hard drive, having an unrecoverable read error just means whatever was in that sector is now gone and the file is corrupted/bit rotted away. Why is it here, with the same level of data corruption, the rebuild cannot continue due to one failure that your standard user might not even notice with unimportant, resilient or rarely accessed files?Despite the rant about pretentious pseudo-intellectual dick swinging at the start of this post, I wont pretend my data dick is terabytes big or spans multiple locations with 3 iterations, but Il give my layman's theory just so perhaps potential big data swingers might have an idea of the type of answer/level of detail Im looking for (its really closer to eli5 than a complex introduction to the inner workings of raid magic/alchemy).My ill informed theory: Due to the way raid rebuilds (constructed through magic assortments of secret data pheromones spread cross the fields of your data land), one ure means that the rest of the data rebuilt after that will be off, breaking the pattern similarly to a building without a foundation rather than missing I frame in those *linux iso* videos you keep on your secondary nas.Anyhow, hopefully this was entertaining enough a read to warrant trying to process the question into one that makes sense and actually uses the correct terminology and then the will to formulate a response that isnt a colourful rendition of the gospel of 3-2-1. Thanks in advance.";">Why cant raid5 rebuild upon discovery of a UREIt can and does.  It depends on the specific implementation, but some will just lose 1 stripe and continue on with the rebuild.There is nothing secret or magic about his RAID 5 works.  It's just the XOR operator.0 XOR 0 = 0  0 XOR 1 = 1  1 XOR 0 = 1  1 XOR 1 = 0  So if you have a disk and the bits go like this:11001...And disk 2, the bits go like:00111...Then you calculate parity like:11110...So if you delete any of the 3 disks, you can recreate it by just doing the XOR operator on the 2 that remain, and the result will be the missing one.#>Why cant raid5 rebuild upon discovery of a URE on a technical level?In case of MDADM it should continue:>[With latest code, a URE during recovery will cause a bad-block to be recordedon the recovered device, and recovery will continue.

Though I personally don't think it's a big issue for a private media box. You can still watch movies and download torrents while the rebuild happens.Oh, and also because of that one CNET article from 2005 :))))))#We've been able to rebuild a RAID5 through URE for at least a decade now.  The original problem was lazy programmers who won't give us a ""continue"" option.  Now pretty much all SW and HW RAID lets you plot through a RAID5 rebuild.  You'll just end up with a stripe of bad data.#RAID-5 (or, more generally, parity-based RAID) can, by its nature, recover from up to P of the N+P disks involved reporting an error on a given stripe. (For RAID-5, P=1, RAID-6 P=2, and then N+P=number of disks, more or less.)There are at least two caveats, though.* Not all errors are going to be explicitly reported errors - some sufficiently bad drives may return data that is not the data you thought you wrote out to them, without throwing an error, and if the RAID implementation doesn't have some way of figuring out which disks are ""right"" and which are ""wrong"" (say, checksums on the blocks on each drive in a stripe), it can't necessarily figure out which drives told it something incorrect, just that something is wrong. (And that's assuming the RAID implementation even checks the parity parts of a stripe on reads where there's not an explicit error reported by the drive  if it doesn't check, it definitely won't know.)(In theory, all hard drives and SSDs have checksums and more complicated encodings underneath what you see as the actual data you wrote out to the disk in order to detect+correct getting a single bit wrong in a read, for example, but I've encountered hard drives that were bad at this before in the wild  you could also simulate this by just writing random bytes to parts of the raw disks underneath the RAID.)* Disk density has grown much faster than disk throughput or disk reliability, so unless you're doing periodic ""patrol reads"" (or patrol scrubs, for ZFS, or whatever your RAID implementation du jour calls them) to actually try reading all the stuff on-disk regularly, you're likely to run into parts of a disk that have read errors that you didn't notice before doing a rebuild because the data wasn't looked at. (In addition, the amount of time it takes to do a rebuild, and thus the window in which you're operating at reduced redundancy, is naively upper bounded by [data on disk] / [throughput of single disk's writes], and since disk throughput has grown much slower than density, that window keeps widening.)#Upvoted. Will parse what you said later.As for continuing the rebuild, I assume the cases I must've kept reading about were to do with hardware raid setups where you couldn't continue regardless?

Say a bit on a hard drive stores either the number 5 (or 1 in actual binary) or the number 0 (0 in actual binary).Using XOR ""adding"": 5+5=0 (actually 10, but we are interested in the last number only). This 0 is our parity data.If one of the 5's would become unknown (disk crash) you are left with the equation: 5+x=0, this can only hold true if x is a 5, so the missing number is able to be reconstructed.This is not just limited to 2 disks, but a lot of them, for example 5 disks+1 parity:5+5+0+5+0=5 (15, but last number is a 5).If any of those numbers becomes a unknown, it can be calculated from the rest.#> I assume the cases I must've kept reading about were to do with hardware raid setups where you couldn't continue regardless?I'm far from an expert on this, but what I heard is that modern hardware raid cards also continue on an URE.It's just that this sub loses it's shit [every time someone just mentions the bad no-no word.](/r/DataHoarder/comments/7wg2ss/my_recent_experience_in_this_sub/) If ZFS or UnRaid does not fit your needs people in this sub will fuck you up. Try to squeez you in a box, because it fits for them.#> hardware raid setups where you couldn't continue regardlessThat hasn't been the case for quite some time.  My 3ware 9650se circa 2008-ish is able to continue rebuild upon a URE.  It will also handle URE during normal read operation by fixing a bad sector from parity, AKA  self-healing.#Probably some hardware RAID controllers wont let you continue.  I am most familiar with software RAID such as  MD RAID in Linux as per a traditional RAID 5 array and that will let you continue the rebuild.  I also am familiar with ZFS which has a RAID5-like mode called RAIDZ, but some people probably don't consider that RAID 5.  ZFS takes it a step farther as to not only let the rebuild continue, but tell you exactly which files contain corruption that couldn't be reconstructed so that you can reacquire/restore them."

Portugal took us 3 months between starting the process and be living here.Portugal have a bunch of visa options, but by what you described, your best option would be to come as a student, master degrees are really unexpensive here.#I am in winnipeg. IT is ok for jobs. we have world class hospitals and medical research facilities ( St. Boniface Hospital and Health Sciences Center). we welcome immigrants and have lots of resources.  good luck!#I really appreciate that, the masters degree was something the I was thinking about since was a goal for me, thanks!#My wife is taking her master at Universidade do Minho, it costs € 1200/year, I think. The student visa doesn't allow to work in Portugal, but once you are offered a contract you can ask for a permission to work. It's not straightforward and not our case so I don't know in detail how it goes.#Thanks again!#Studebt visas usually allow to work 20 hours.#Yep, he's right.

I'm really looking for anything right now, but I'd prefer data on junior players since I want to play around with machine learning and prospects.I have access to EliteProspects' API, but that only lists G, A, PIM, and +/- for players, not SOG or anything else.;CorsiCa. Best data set out there#Data on the Junior players is very limited. To be honest data from most leagues is really bad compared to the NHL. Most sites I've seen with these data have roughly what EliteProspects has.For NHL stuff http://www.corsica.hockey/ is pretty boss as /u/Buskea22 said. You may want to scrape your own if you're looking for all the data possibe. If you're wanting massive amounts of data in one go https://github.com/icambridge/hockeystats/tree/master/stats/player has all the players in the NHL and more from 5 months ago. With some badlly written code to allow you to scrape again. #[Flick through this rack](http://www.hockeyabstract.com/thoughts/completelistofhockeyanalyticsdataresources)#Why not use the NHL api? /u/syini666 [did a great job in creating documentation for it on Github](https://github.com/dword4/nhlapi). Edit: I'm an idiot. Didn't notice you wanted junior stats. My bad.#you should try baseball. Hockey is not a statistical sport and the current stats are trash.#Advanced stats are also super hard to get a hold of outside of the NHL. There's some guy in Finland doing some good stuff.#Thanks! I'm probably just going to end up scraping the sites of junior leagues for stats.#Thanks so much! Pretty much exactly what I was looking for. #I love baseball but it is easy to accumulate solid stats when a game pauses after every play.#You got more info on his work?#Best tip I can give you from scraping DEL stats to get better stats is to scrape the game result pages.

What are the requirements, how do i get into it....I have an Oracle OCA in 11g and a little knowledge of python programming.";"Would love to get into it.  I'm going to school for Financial Services and a minor in something IT related.Data to Managment to ISO to CTO would be great.  Just want to learn a skill that can let me support a family and weather all the coming financial storms.I'm so worried mid level IT is all going to be outsourced.  Seems like millions are overseas willing to work for 1/3rd our pay.  CEO's just see $$$ savings.#""Big Data"", like a couple other terms, is 90% marketing hype. (big data = data, is the joke). A lot of the basic concepts have been around as long as digital data has. But still, there is a large focus on collecting and using data in industries that haven't traditionally done so. It seems to me that it breaks down in to two areas: storage/access and analysis. I work with distributed storage systems and their component parts - S3, ELK stack, etc. - but not much on the actual use and manipulation of the data to solve business problems. We have a programmer on staff that does the latter. That's similar to what I see in other small-to-midmarket operations - The sysadmin/infrastructure folks end up learning how to build and maintain ""big data"" systems and the programmers learn what their users need from that data and how to manipulate it for that purpose.If you were getting in to the field, one of those two paths might make sense and would leave a lot of other opportunities open along the way. On the analytics side, there's tons of resources out there for relevant skills, lists of popular apps to learn, etc. but a big complaint I hear about is the lack of *actual mathematicians/statisticians* in the field.#It's mostly statistics. R, SQL, SASS.#Minor in programming! I highly recommend anyone in a science field get a minor in programming. It's extremely difficult to find someone who understands the complexity of something like actuarial science AND can write a program to solve problems in that field. #Thank you for the response, does my OCA lead to this path or .....#I don't know, I've tried some learn to program tutorials online and signed up for the AWS free service, it's just that nothing has grabbed my attention.I'm thinking more as I've worked at this MSP for three years now, that I want to focus more on the business side of things and less on IT.  I'd rather work to make the company money than be viewed as a cost that can be off-shored."
cybersecurity;8877y1;1522378025.0;/r/cybersecurity/comments/8877y1/the_only_way_to_purge_facebook_conversation/;The only way to purge Facebook conversation history.;The posts on my timeline are meant to be somewhat public, but I don't really want Facebook seeing every conversation I've ever had for all of time... and since there's two copies of every conversation both parties have to delete (not archive) it. Big data is just getting started and that is a scary amount of information to have on everyone.TL DRAsk everyone on messenger to delete their conversation with you, and then delete all of your conversations. This may take a while.I looked up secure messaging apps today and it seemed like the best options were:WhatsApp: It is owned by Facebook too and collects metadata, but it does offer end-to-end encryption (The messages are only stored locally on your phone and the recipient's). Without it being open source though you can't ever know how secure it really is.Signal: Has end to end encryption, a desktop interface, is open source and doesn't collect metadata.;It's all in logs anyways so they'll always be able to access it.#Apparently there's a chrome add-on to delete all messages:[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-delete-all-messa/hgiidlnejdlfoacoeleopkljhbckmlko?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-delete-all-messa/hgiidlnejdlfoacoeleopkljhbckmlko?hl=en)#Either wiki or Snowden proved that the NSA can break signal encryption but it’s still much safer than any other messenger.Be cautious of ANYTHING owner by Facebook.Edit: only where end to end encryption is already compromised.#How about telegram or zom? I've heard that they're secure, can anyone else clarify? #It didn't say quite that, just that they could get your signal messages if your endpoint was already compromised, but didn't say they had cracked the encryption #Something to still be cogniscent of is that all those encrypted messages can still be stored and then when a crack is found 1,3,5 years down the road lets say then itd be as if you never took precautions to begin with.#Thank you for the clarification.

artificial;89mpg6;1522819453.0;/r/artificial/comments/89mpg6/are_there_less_data_intensive_ai_approaches/;Are there less data intensive AI approaches?;In the last few years, with the advent of big data and cloud, the world seems to be moving towards a data driven model. And all forms of Artificial Intelligence we see, comes from training on huge data sets before it can be put to use(correct me if I am wrong). So my question is, is this vast amount of training data a pre requisite for all AI approaches, or there are approaches which don't need such huge data. If yes, how effective are those and please point me to the research in those areas.P.S. I am a beginner only in the field of AI with not much know how. Please excuse if question sounds naive.;"Yes, AI long predates the big data explosion and there are plenty of models that do not require training on data to work. Basically any non-learning approach has no need or use for training data, since it doesn't change.Search problems (and those that can be converted to search, like logical theorem proving) often do not need a learning approach, algorithms like Simulated Annealing, Hill Climbing, A*, or even Depth First Search (and it's variants) can often solve these kinds of problems just fine. The obvious example being pathfinding for NPCs in games, which really don't make sense as a learning agent, they just need to find a path to get from point A to B.#Outside of machine learning (ML) but still under the umbrella of AI, there are many methods that don't really require any data because they don't learn (see chatterbox's post). Instead, they tend to have (domain) knowledge coded into them by humans.Within the ML domain there are also a wide variety of methods that vary in how much data they need. Look for methods that are ""sample-efficient"", ""data-efficient"" or ""small data"". Most methods are more efficient than (most) deep learning, but it seems linear methods, SVMs and ensemble methods get mentioned especially often when I search for this. You can also look at methods for ""zero-shot"", ""one-shot"" or ""few-shot"" learning, but in my experience these tend to be semi-supervised methods that still require a lot of unlabeled data (but not that many labels), so I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for.#Maybe [this](https://en.chessbase.com/post/challenging-studies-automatically)?#Maybe not what you are after, but transfer learning can dramatically reduce the amount of training data needed for a particular task.#So from your reply, it gives me a picture that what we hear in mainstream media as being termed AI, which is getting the hype is just a special kind of AI that deals with ""Learning"" sub problem. Learning due to it's very nature requires experience, which comes from data. Hence such solutions end up being data hungry.Beyond that there are other sub problems like you mentioned that don't need that much data. That makes me wonder, what are some interesting real world applications of AI that does not need a learning agent? Like you mentioned games.#you have hit spot on on where my question came from in the first para of your reply. I was considering AI to be synonymous to Machine Learning, while in reality Machine Learning is just one sub field under the larger umbrella of AI. Googling for domain knowledge coded systems lead me to discovering about Expert systems. But it seems like they are thing of past now, not recieving much attention. I am not really looking for any data efficient models of machine learning, still thanks for sharing. I didn't know about them. #thanks for the reply. I am not looking for anything that specific. Just trying to understand why all the AI related things we hear these days requires so much data. Turns out, my view was incomplete, it's the learning sub problem that requires so much data to train. #Yep, machine learning is part of AI, but it is not all of AI. Checkers was solved without learning AFAIK, not the most real-world application but you literally cannot beat computers at checkers anymore without intentionally restricting them. Map colouring is solved as a constraint satisfaction problem, which is often searched.Logical agents and theorem proving have some incredibly useful applications, but it depends on what you consider 'needing data'. They don't need example data to learn from like ML does, but they do need to be given some base facts from which to begin inference. If you are able to represent your world in logic then you can do fairly powerful reasoning with it. There is a popular toy example for this called the Wumpus World, in which there are obstacles (bottomless pits, the Wumpus) and goals (gold) which you can perceive (breezes, stench, glitter, etc.). This may seem silly, but it is perfectly reasonable to represent your physical environment as a gridworld with obstacles in plenty of real exploration problems. If you can represent your world as a set of logical sentences then you can infer the environment from what you can perceive.#> Googling for domain knowledge coded systems lead me to discovering about Expert systems. But it seems like they are thing of past now, not recieving much attention.> > I used to think this too, but a few years back I met a professor who told me that expert systems are still being used and developed. They have always been useful in at least some contexts and this hasn't stopped. It's just not sexy anymore, because nobody thinks this is a great path towards more general and capable AI. The professor also told me we know pretty well how to make such systems, so it's more of an application issue than a research issue. But if you search, you can still find some research on it as well, because of course things can always be improved.#Your reply opened quite a few paths for me to explore. This is certainly helpful. It seems we have been able to impart the art of inference to computers. Given some rules, and an environment they can understand, they can act according to the given rules, in the process forming new understanding by deducting from the rules. But in terms of the human world, logic can take us so far only. I am curious, is there anything in AI world that is trying to understand emotion. Is AI capable of understanding emotion yet? Are we thinking in this direction? Or have we not yet been able to formulate the problem statement for this task?#This is interesting to know. I read that they were written in old languages like lisp which faced issues when connecting with databases and other modern sources of information. Moreover, General Artificial intelligence seems to be the holy grail towards which the whole AI community is running. Anything which fails short of delivering that promise slowly gets pushed in backgroud.Speaking of General AI, Deepmind calls their AI a general purpose AI, right? How true is their claim?"

Halp?;"I recently re-acquired a 95-96 Squier strat I owned for about 10 years after parting with it for a few years. The intonation was awful. I tried adjusting it myself, but I ran out of screw and the 6th string, 12th fret was still 1/4 of the way to an F.I took it in to a Guitar Center and asked the tech to take a look. He acknowledged that the intonation was really bad and also noted that there were some wiring issues. The volume knob doesn't work (it's stuck at max), the tone knobs don't work, and the pickup selector is borked. He then offered to trade me a Peavey Raptor that he's repaired and modified. Here's what he said about what he's done to it:""It had a broken spot on the body where the tremolo meets the body so I had to glue that back down, completely rewired, set up, and converted to a hardtail, which I would recommend keeping like that being that it was repaired there. I also have some better pickups I could give you, and then put in later for free (outside of [Major Guitar Retailer]) if you want to change out but I'd listen to these first because it does sound pretty good. The other pickups are alnico. I can modify it at that time as well if you'd like again at no charge.""He said he wants my guitar 'cause he doesn't have one of this type, he likes the color, and he has the parts to replace it so he wouldn't have to spend any money on it.At the surface, it seems like a fine deal. Trade a half-broken guitar for a working one. I know Peavey's are lower quality than Squiers, but I'm not sure how much it matters at this point?Anywho, I'm going to see and play it tomorrow, so that's obviously a big data point to consider. I'm also considering just fixing my Squier. I've never done guitar repair before, but I'm generally pretty handy. I do most of my own household and car repairs. I know basic soldering. So, two questions:* If I decide to trade, am I missing something huge here? Obviously if it sounds awful or doesn't work, that's a no. But I'm not sure what to look for other than just how it sounds and if the knobs/switches works.* Am I crazy for considering on fixing it myself? Any advice here would be greatly appreciated!*Note: I'm super broke right now and could barely afford the $50 for the intonation fix, so ""save up for a better one"" isn't really an option for me right now.";"While it's not a sought after brand, Peavey make good guitars. I have an older Peavey Predator that has one of the slickest necks I've played on.#Assuming that the new guitar is fully functional and will intonate, why wouldn't you take it? #A 20-year-old busted up squire is really not worth very much, so the worst case here is that you're losing $50 in exchange value or so. It really doesn't sound like he's trying to rip you off, though. Play the other guitar. Do you like it? Is it going to inspire you to pick up and play the guitar? Then go for it. If you pick it up and the guitar just doesn't speak to you, then don't. #I say go try it out, see how it feels, and go from there. If you like it, might as well if you ask me. Theres nothing ever really 'bad' about a guitar unless its broken or extremely poorly made, the one i painted myself is a cheap ltd beginner model, barely cost me $150, and it feels almost like my most expensive guitar.#Electronics are just about the easiest thing to fix when it comes to electric guitars.You have basic soldering skills, so honestly you could probably completely re-wire your strat in about half an hour. You'd need to shell out about $15-20 for a new set of potentiometers and a switch, but that's about it.The tech *was* able to fix the intonation issue eventually right? So all you're dealing with is the electronics issue?I'd 100% recommend trying to fix it yourself over trading it for a guitar with a structural repair.I'd never consider a guitar with wonky electronics ""broken"". Electronics issues are always fixable. On the other hand, a guitar that was cracked, glued back together and is recommended to only be used as a hardtail... that's ""broken"". I'm sure the guy did a good job with the repair, but when it comes down to two guitars of about equal value, I'd always stick with the one with less damage.#A lot of tone/vol pot issues can be fixed with a good spray of switch cleaner, and sticky ones often respond to a bit of WD40 where the shaft goes into the body of the pot. #One way to look at it is, which one could you sell if you needed to? A repaired Peavey may not bring much in terms of sale price, but any guitar that can be played will bring more than a broken Squier. #My first guitar was a Peavey T-26, bought used in 1984. I still have it, and it's as good now as it was then.#I can’t think of a reason not to. Just seems a little too good to be true, but that could just be the pessimist in me. #My brain tells me that it really is just that simple, but my gut is stupid and skittish. Thanks for the validation!#I think it's the fact that a more experienced guy might be pulling a fast one on you. But that's pretty unusual...#That’s what my gut is afraid of, but then I’m like “It’s a busted 20 y/o Squier. WTF do I have to lose?”"

bigdata;89jowp;1522796529.0;/r/bigdata/comments/89jowp/data_processing_pipeline_tools_for_unstructured/;Data processing pipeline tools for unstructured non-stanard file types;"I wouldn’t consider this a “big data” issue as it’s only about 1-2TB of data I would be moving around (in total). But there isn’t a very active data pipeline subreddit that I’m aware of.I am looking for suggestions on how to avoid a script soup mess to setup a pipeline to send files down through a processing. Unstructured files in my case are binary files which in this case are proprietary CAD files.pipeline.A 30k foot view currently.The CAD files are in a PostgreSQL database that have table references to all the metadata and a file pointer to the actual file on the file system. What this pipeline needs to do is:1. Read each record and do a conversion to a standard (non proprietary) format (we already have a tool to do the actual conversion of the file).2. Insert a record into another table with references to the part on the FS along with all of its metadata (filename, hash, log of conversion etc.)3. Take each record from part and do CAD extraction on the data (again tools already built to do this extraction of the data we want it just needs to be called through the pipeline).4. Insert the extracted data into the database (keeping references all intact through the process).5. Lots of other extraction/conversion/calculations...that I won't go into. Once I can get an architecture/pattern working, I feel adding on to this will be fairly trivial.We are doing all of this in Python and unfortunately has to be on Windows.I built a pipeline with Luigi to do the conversion before we had the database and it worked, but after about 5-10k tasks it started to choke under its own weight. Once we started putting the metadata and stuff into the database I figured out that its a LOT harder writing tasks with Luigi when dealing with the database.I don't think NiFi gives me any benefit. Would something like Kafka provide the structure for a pipeline of what I'm wanting? After reading about it, but seems like I could still end up with a bit of script soup potentially?For example I was thinking something for step 1) have a producer sending each record to a Kafka ""step 1 topic"". On the other end, I could have a python script (could there be something used in place to manage these scripts?) as the consumer reading the topic and processing each one as it hits the queue? At that point just sending messages and having producers and consumers processing items as each their respective topics.Would there be a better way of doing this? Managing this? ";"All but the windows part I think is a really good fit for Xcalar.  Where are the CAD files / postgres database stored?  I don't think Kafka will help you, this seems like a batch job, not a stream.PM me if you want to talk about It. #Take a deeper look at Apache NiFi.  It should be able to handle your use case.  There is the ability to run python code in a processor, if there is custom tasks not handled by the built in processors.#Silly question, but is there a reason that keeps the work from being split up and batched? Does one part of the work require access to all of it? or can you just break up the task and restart/clear the memory at certain points? Interesting problem, thanks for posting.#Just the cursory look at Xscalar seems overkill and not really what we are intending to do. We aren’t performing analytics on the data, we are simply doing conversions and saving that data off (meta data). Plus we are cheap and wouldn’t be able to buy it anyways :).All of it is on our own equipment (NAS, db servers etc.). You are right in that it’s more “batch” oriented. However, I was thinking of using Kafka to help with the organizing of the pipeline. Luigi “works” but it’s a royal pain in the ass to deal with.For example, pulling a list of files from the db and making tasks is easy enough. However, when you want to process that task and start breaking it up to smaller tasks it becomes extremely problematic. For example once the task is created, we need to 1)convert the file (easy in luigi), 2) calculate the hash of the file (easy but this is where it kinds falls apart) 3) move the newly generated file to different part of file system 4) insert data based on results from 2), 3), with information from those steps and then “Mock” the insert up into Luigi into the database.The problem for luigi is that I would end up having to pass 8-10 parameters around constantly through the pipeline to get that information. Luigi seems to just like to operator on files. When you start mixing database calls and such it gets really awkward and it gets in your way.I could probably write up 5-6 scripts to do this easily in a day and call each one but would like some parallelism (lots of files) and some organization in the process.#So i’ve been down the path of NiFi several times on multiple occasions. Unfortunately, every single time i’ve investigated using it i’ve went a different way because it was too cumbersome. It just seemed to get in the way and was difficult to debug issues or didn’t work the way I thought it would or had really odd interactions. I also don’t like the fact that everything for the most part is tied up in the UI. I just don’t know of a good way of organizing things within it other than things being one off stuff.What I felt NiFi was decent at was the simplistic processes of moving files around and pulling files from different items, and then sending them to a different service be it a FS or some other tool.I’ll take a look at it again to see how well it handles the custom python stuff (which i’m 150% sure i’ll need) and see what has changed since I last check on it, but I don’t feel hopeful.#That is the point in all of it. I am breaking this into fairly small parts (pretty much as small as it goes). 1) pull record of a single file and convert file 2) calculate the hash of converted file 3) move file into the location of where converted files go 4) insert a record into the database with metadata (hash of the converted file, the id of the original file (for reference), the time it took to convert, the metadata related to the file (filesize, created time, etc.). Those steps would be a single ""stage"". There are about 5 more stages in this process that would require roughly the same process. Could I do all of step1 before I moved on to step 2? Certainly, but to finish the entire stage I would need to complete all the way through step 4 for all of the files. Just makes more sense to me to push each file through the entire stage where all the data is readily available where I wouldn't have to persist the calculated hash of each file outside of the database since that would be the next step, which is to insert all that information into the database. I can write the Python code to go through this entire stage pretty easily but the other 4 or 5 stages will obviously depend on this particular stage completing. The naive way would be to write the python code for each stage and just call each script on a schedule with task scheduler or something, but that turns into spaghetti soup pretty quick. In addition, what happens if I want to move the stages around? Or we need to do something else between two of the stages? I can just forsee it being problematic if there isn't any thought given to it. #K cool. We run python as sort of microservices through our compute engine. So you would basically build what we call a data flow (data pipeline) and each transformation step would be a snippet of python code UDF that performs a task you've described, e.g. conversion, metadata extraction, hash calculation.  Xcalar runs these scripts in parallel on as many cores are available and would put the results wherever you want - e.g. you could write out your new files and upsert details into your database.  Once you've designed the data flow you could pass it parameters per file or whatever and run it against all the files in the set and it would crank away.You'd be treating the CAD databases like a record or table and doing transforms not unlike those we see in complex data prep. LMK if I've at least grasped the crux of what you're trying to do and whether this sounds feasible or I'm way off.  Thanks. #Leveraging the Record oriented processors (ConvertRecord, QueryRecord, LookupRecord,etc ) can simplify many tasks that in previous versions of NiFi (<1.0) were quite cumbersome.#It sounds like you have a decent grasp of it and sounds like it might would work in this case (when i briefly looked at it, i got the idea it was simply a spark/hive/pig implementation runner for analytics). Really for us we are at this point and time looking for a job runner to do the batch conversions, calculations, etc. Unfortunately, for us Windows is a hard requirement (have to interface with win32com interface for one of the tools) and no way to budget for pay software unfortunately.#After spending the last hour or so looking at the information in your suggestion above and NiFi in general again I am still struggling with seeing how NiFi would provide more benefit than the cost of complexity it incurs1. The vast majority of each stage would just be going from ExecuteProcess to ExecuteProcess. If I'm going to maintain code (which I will in this case), I don't feel its appropriate to do it in NiFi. 2. In this code, I'll be interfacing with the database that will potentially change. Right now my models handle the table and relationship changes. Not that I'm a hardcore ORM user, but having a single place to store the models and reference in the code of updates to the database is beneficial. I'm not quite sure how NiFi would play with this, I'm guessing I would just have to write the queries and then update them all when/if they change. But the organization of the code is probably the most beneficial part for me. 3. All of the code in Python will require interfacing with Win32Com, or other dll based tools/libraries which tend to make things more difficult and staying within a pure python environment would be beneficial. The python code is essentially wrappers for exes or more complex tools, unfortunately.  3. Debugging with NiFi is not straight-forward. If I have a problem with my code in Python, I can step through it with PyCharm and quickly identify whats going on (or at least have an idea). I've messed with Nifi for hours not having a clue at what was going on. Only to find out it was a quirk with the processor. 4. Probably more ""gotchas"" than I'm even thinking about. At least that's what happened to me last time when I tried using NiFi for something. It seemed good on the surface, but when I started getting into it, everything felt really awkward and cumbersome to do.Please correct me if I'm all wrong on this but this is just what I see. I would love to see a NiFi wizard walk through most of this process and show how it can be organized and created quickly without a lot of overhead. For example, I could write a Python script that handles all of the steps I listed above (1-4) and call that with NiFi but not sure what that would gain me with just more complexity of having to have NiFi around to run the job and being a glorified cronjob.

sysadmin;85zgt0;1521606999.0;/r/sysadmin/comments/85zgt0/so_many_options_so_little_experience/;So many options.. so little experience;Hello all,New sysadmin here at a 250 person financial company. I’m looking into moving non-mission critical workloads to Azure, AWS, or Google, and was hoping to draw on the expertise here.My requirements are simple in the sense that I am only wanting to build small/medium VMs at the best price per GB/cpu/RAM. I am not looking to build or deploy custom code, cloud databases, machine learning, or big data.After my initial research, Google is winning. Their flexibility and available options for storage are incredibly attractive (high HDD performance per instance, 64 TB persistent disks, multi reader mounting) and the price paid for compute looks to be better than the competition. The option for VPN also appears to be 1-2 times faster than what is offered by the competition. However, the Windows licensing pricing seems immensely high compared to Azure and I have no clue why.AWS is the big kid on the block and has a huge suite of offerings and great support/KB, but they seem to nickel and dime you for every little thing and have a complex pricing structure. Windows pricing is also higher compared to Azure. The performance of disk appears to be much lower than google and marginally less than Azure if memory serves. Azure is nice as we have an EA and they roll in SQL/Windows licensing into their monthly rates. Their storage offerings are limited in terms of managed disks and the baseline performance is less than Google. Azure also looks to make every last penny off of the customer as they can with micro-billings. Azure does have some sweet benefits in terms of backup and their archive storage pricing is much less than the competition. Some background: my on-prem infrastructure runs exclusively on a flash SAN. The workloads I want to move are a mixture of file archives and email archives that are infrequently accessed, but still accessed several times daily. This also includes several database servers. We have no option for cheaper storage so I want to give that storage back to the mission critical servers and services.There’s so many factors, and it’s making it hard to pick. Has anyone done a thorough cross comparison from the compute/storage aspect and come to any conclusions? Tl dr - wanting to move to Google, Azure, or AWS. Lots of options and not sure if I’m missing something. Google appears to be winning.Thanks in advance!;AWS pricing is really complicated but if a VPS fits in your requirements you may use Lightsail and you'll have a fixed monthly fee.#At such a small scale, and given that you will still have in house hardware, I would be very surprised if putting a few services in the cloud makes any sense.Both from a financial and from a technical point of view.What problem or you trying to solve?#Only pay for compute cycles if you really need them. If you used each platform's native database service, you wouldn't need the VM (and thus the 24/7 compute bill). Each platform should also have simple storage that can be nearline. I think you owe yourself the opportunity to learn what you can do with the platform tools  building VMs is a bit dated approach.#All of the cloud options are geared towards pretending to care about you while fleecing you for the maximum amount of money that they can. #Lightsail doesn’t look like it’s exactly what I need, but it looks really cool! I’ve got a few other side projects that could possibly benefit from this product. I’ll definitely look into it!#We have several archival servers that occupy in the neighborhood of 3 TB each and are currently running on an all flash SAN. We don’t have any other on premise options for storage, and freeing up that storage would allow us to do focus on more important things with our existing equipment.#That’s one of the things that is most attractive to me when moving to cloud providers. I can optimize my VMs/services to save costs when I don’t need them or ramp up when required. I’m not opposed using their services, but we often use 3rd party apps that likely do not support those services. I’ll definitely look into the possibility and see what can be done.#Buying yourself a few 10s of TB of spinning disk storage will cost you less than even thinking about cloud. Also work out how long it would take to move that chunk of data, or parts if it,  on and off site.#I’ll definitely take a look at buying another appliance, especially if it can save me money. You seem pretty adverse to running VMs in the cloud. From a cost perspective, running similar VMs (RAM/CPU) in my on prem infrastructure is pretty similar once you factor in all the costs like licensing, support, agreements, overhead to configure and run, and other hardware like switches/routers. Without those, we wouldn’t have all those same costs. Other than storage, what costs more in the cloud? With depreciation, tax incentives, and expected life of 5 years, on premise makes the most sense, but I doubt we will have the necessary capacity for 5 years.  As far as transfer is concerned, 3 TB alone will take quite a while, but we’ve got a pretty good pipe into our data center.#> You seem pretty adverse to running VMs in the cloud.Not adverse, but I don't see the point if you already have everything you need, except for some additional storage, on-site.

This reduced the storage overhead of duplicating data. This worked best for datasets that could fit in memory.Hadoop changed the paradigm by moving the compute resource to the data.  This works great for giant datasets that would be prohibitive to move over a LAN to the compute nodes.  Although the amount of storage space increased... but storage is cheap.Now the pendulum is swinging back toward separation with very fast network fabric and GPU computing becoming more prevalent.#You can scale each independently according to the needs of the workload#Decoupling storage from compute allows you to treat your compute infrastructure as completely ephemeral.  Leave storage to highly available services such as S3, and spawn compute infrastructure via configuration management tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc).   Then your only question re: storage/IO comes down to how much disk you need available for staging/shuffle.
bigdata;88w81h;1522637135.0;/r/bigdata/comments/88w81h/certification_in_big_data/;Certification in Big Data;I am looking for any certification in the Bug Data space. None of the certifications has a detailed structure to learning different services in Big Data. Any suggestions? ;"SQL.#Big Data should be a term used as a common umbrella over various domains to discuss their overlap, which often comes in the form of some of the technologies being used.There's no ""Big Data certification"" much in the same way there is no ""stoic philosophy certification"". It's just an abstract term that is used to abstract over a whole range of problems with no clear-cut solution (and thus no way for anyone getting certified to solve them)... that's not to say people won't try to sell you snake oil#There are many certifications available online. You should check out this [list of courses for Big data](https://digitaldefynd.com/best-big-data-certification-course-training/?kar)#Sorry, what does this mean? #True.What I meant with that is, is there any certification with a learning path to know the services. Suppose I want to learn and get certified in Hive, Hbase, Cassandra for storage. A certification for ranger, kms, etc for security.Some for processing etc. Including certain newer ones like Kafka. I was trying to look for something to cover all the different services generally sold together in a normal distribution (Cloudera, HW, MapR etc).I could not find anything like that.Few acceptable certification paths generally include a very small subset of the complete distro.Hope I am clear now. #Again to add on to it. I was looking into HW certification HDPCD which covers DI and storage only. Nothing else. Cloudera does not have one related to the services. Hence the question. #Get certified in something to do with SQL Development. You want to do ""big data"", but don't know what SQL is? It's probably a good place to start, then.#Let me try to explain my point differently, what exactly do you want to certify ?The tools you just describe can be easily understood by spending a few hours reading about them. I don't think you need a certificate to prove you've read a man page.If you want to certify you can solve problems using them, again, we reach the same issue of the problems that they help solve being very different and the paint-point not being tool usage. E.g. Let's say you want to build a recommender that uses user <Insert chat app> messages stored in Cassandra... that's a ""big data"" problem that involves Cassandra, but the pain points are knowledge of parallel computing, machine learning, statistics and just general logic in general, to figure out how to test and design an algorithm that has to work on a dataset consisting of hundreds of trillions of messages.Where you use these tools also completely changes the way you use them. I would not use the same tools the same way in a system that deal with say... large, infrequent monetary transactions (banking) as I would in a one that deals with very small, very frequent transactions (e.g. RTB in advertising). ""Big data"" can be applied to both of those fields, the same tools can be applied to both of those fields, but one would value consistency and test-ability and the other speed and reduced-costs.#True and this is an interesting way to put it. So to achieve solutions to real life problems like those, I would still have to know what are the different ways to achieve one end result and which of the list of services we have to use it, Cassandra vs Hive for storage or Kafka vs some other streams to process RT etc. Which service to use where, what is the strength and weakness of each.More than certification I am truly interested in the learning path. Cuz I am pretty new to this field, I am kind of lost where to start. as this would be a considerable effort of time and energy, I need a direction you might say! But I kind of feel (from your arguments) that the kind of knowledge is achievable only through sufficient research and a lot of self learning, and it's unfair may be for me to ask for a learning path which covers every aspect of the ""big data universe""."

The big data/subvertedelectionsclaim is as fundamentally flawed as Congress’ and other Opposition parties’claim on rigged electronic voting machines (EVMs). Let’s rescue some key factsfrom the blizzard of political and media sound bites.First, the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica (CA) controversy is about user privacyand dodgy ways of collecting personal data. That’s a matter of policyregulation, not electoral process. Whether tech giants that depend onadvertising revenue generated by loose privacy controls can find anotherbusiness model, if regulation makes data hoovering tough, is a crucialquestion. But that’s not related directly to elections.Second, if firms such as CA are, indeed, willing to provide cash and otherequally attractive inducements to subvert elections in various countries,that’s not a matter of big data, but old-fashioned election corruption.Outfits that don’t use data analytics are also guilty of such practices.Third, fake news riding on social media networks owned by tech companies thatwant news-driven advertising but don’t want editorial responsibility is also aproblem, a big one. But that, again, isn’t directly and solely an electionprocess problem. It is another, larger regulation issue for tech giants toface up to.Fourth, and related to third: are we seriously going to argue that beforesocial media, election campaigns didn’t see dodgy, dangerous untruths beingpeddled as facts? And that voters are so gullible that rubbish circulating onFacebook andWhatsAppgroups will mostly determine voting decisions? Now, with these facts rescuedfrom fake views, one major question remains: is micro-targeting and voterprofiling through data analytics wrong, in the sense that it delegitimisesvoterdecision-making? Answer: absolutely not. Here’s why.**The Tools of the Tirade**First, ours is an electoral democracy where caste, religion, regional andlinguistic identity, and urban-rural divide have always been key inputs forcampaign strategy. So, the difference between mohalla speeches that target asmall subset of voters and targeted messages created by data analytics is amatter of different tools, not morality.What’s the difference between reaching out to Rajputs through Whats-App or asmall jansabha? The former is, possibly, more efficient as a messaging tool.Second, that modern data tools can help isolate voters or individuals for veryspecific messages matters much less than critics will have you believe. UScritics of data analytics have given examples of how social media campaignshelped political parties or lobby groups tailor messages for voters in smallareas, or decide which venue in a locality would be better for a campaignrally.Examples have been cited where social media preferences can be analysedtopredict a voter’s political leaning and ethnicity. Much hand-wringing has alsohappened over the fact that in social media, users can’t see views contrary totheir own once the platform learns enough and starts providing tailoredcontent. All this, apparently, is subverting voter choice.That’s an extraordinary claim to make. It assumes that the voter in any moderndemocracy is a helpless wretch who can’t access any other source ofinformation other than what he gets from tailored content in social media.If you spend 50 minutes a day on a social media platform, you apparently areunable to remember that there are multiple information sources, many offeringviews different from your own, you can access. Or, if you look at campaignmessages targeted at you while posting vacation photos, you apparently arerobbed of basic powers of thought. This silly assumption is at the heart ofthe big dataelections scare.And it’s worse than a silly assumption when you consider the most basic factof elections: no party wins a poll solely, or mostly, on the basis of thetechnological efficiency of its messaging. So, our third and last argument isthat big data by itself can never swing a verdict and, therefore, it can’tsubvert voter choice.Why did BJP win in 2014 general elections?

Minus Modi andAmit Shah, two formidable politicians who have transformed the party’s election-fighting ethos, BJP wouldn’t have won so many elections. Without a cleveralliance between Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav, two veteran and wily Biharleaders, JD(U)-RJD wouldn’t have defeated BJP in the state.So, big data can’t subvert elections.

jobs;88b6zh;1522423921.0;/r/jobs/comments/88b6zh/working_in_banking_area_for_5_years_is_there_any/;Working in banking area for 5 years. Is there any chance to switch to gamedev without starting my career from the scratch?;Hello reddit,Right now I'm working as a business analyst for 3 years in a bank, and I really want to quit.Here are some concerns I have:Problem #1: I have no idea what I could do in gamedev since I’m not quite sure if business analysts are actually needed in this area. I know that several companies are looking for data analysts and I actually have masters degree in big data, but it was a while ago and I don’t quite remember anything except for general definitions and code languages’ names. Also I really can't lower my income and start as an intern. I'm open to learning new stuff tho.Problem #2: I live in Russia and I doubt any employee outside of Russia would be interested in me if i’m not a developer lol. Meanwhile, Riot Games (my current dream) has 0 open vacancies in Russia. Do companies hire analysts from abroad if they don’t have resident permit?Another option I’m looking for is working in tech support related area in gaming companies since I have some working experience as 2nd-3rd line support in the past. However, the same problems are relevant in this case (again).Did anyone experience such transition?;I know this probably isn't the best option but many dedicated server hosts hire remote support staff. That could potentially be a gateway since those servers are generally used for games such as Minecraft, Battlefield, etc. #They need QA analysts and shit. I wish I had better advice but those are low level roles in gaming. That and - hell, those people need data analysts too. Esp. in something like Tableau (at least in the U.S.).#I guess it's time to remember my Tableau and r lessons huh

The courses are designed to teach you how to interpret analysis done by data scientists and how to manage a data scientist or data analyst.The courses are not designed to teach you how to code in r.  Our courses use a watered down SAS version to teach us the fundamentals and how to ask the right questions.Frankly, you go do a masters in data science to become a data scientist. You go do an mba to make business decisions using data reports given to you.  I would look into MIT or Stanford’s courses as they may be more analytics heavy.  However, I don’t imagine the coursework being super in the weeds.#What's your typical workday look like? What programs do you spend most of your time using? What's the most ""value-add"" analysis you do?#Typically it's Business Analysis Manager or similar#[deleted]#To be honest, I am not sure it matters. MBA is a general degree, a lot employers don't care what your concentration is in (I am not saying all employers don't care). I know a good number of schools don't even list your concentration.I think the big thing is take the classes that are of interest to you and gives you a skillset that you want. Mix and match."

If my data in column F is blank I would like to automatically populate Worksheet 2 with the rows that are blank.   Ideally I only want a select few columns to populate over to Worksheet 2.    Let's say A,B,D,E as an example.  The idea would be that if Column F is blank I'm missing testing on a weld, and I need to contract out the testing.    Columns ABDE are the data my contractor needs to do his work.  Extra columns would be clutter on a report to him. Basically I'm building a printable report if some cells are blank.

Adjust the 1 to give you the columns you want (remember control shift enter). In your example it'd be 1,2,4,5.Now drag down. You might want to wrap it in IFERROR to make it blank when it's done.

Is there a way to add two checks?   Specifically if F is Blank AND E is not blank?

programming;86rux2;1521880737.0;/r/programming/comments/86rux2/comparison_of_the_open_source_olap_systems_for/;Comparison of the Open Source OLAP Systems for Big Data: ClickHouse, Druid and Pinot;;> Summary> ClickHouse, Druid and Pinot have fundamentally similar architecture, and their own niche between general-purpose Big Data processing frameworks such as Impala, Presto, Spark, and columnar databases with proper support for unique primary keys, point updates and deletes, such as InfluxDB.> Due to their architectural similarity, ClickHouse, Druid and Pinot have approximately the same “optimization limit”. But as of now, all three systems are immature and very far from that limit. Substantial efficiency improvements to either of those systems (when applied to a specific use case) are possible in a matter of a few engineer-months of work. I don’t recommend to compare performance of the subject systems at all, choose the one which source code you are able to understand and modify, or in which you want to invest.> Among those three systems, ClickHouse stands a little apart from Druid and Pinot, while the latter two are almost identical, they are pretty much two independently developed implementations of exactly the same system.> ClickHouse more resembles “traditional” databases like PostgreSQL. A single-node installation of ClickHouse is possible. On small scale (less than 1 TB of memory, less than 100 CPU cores) ClickHouse is much more interesting than Druid or Pinot, if you still want to compare with them, because ClickHouse is simpler and has less moving parts and services. I would say that it competes with InfluxDB or Prometheus on this scale, rather than with Druid or Pinot.> Druid and Pinot more resemble other Big Data systems in the Hadoop ecosystem. They retain “self-driving” properties even on very large scale (more than 500 nodes), while ClickHouse requires a lot of attention of professional SREs. Also, Druid and Pinot are in the better position to optimize for infrastructure costs of large clusters, and better suited for the cloud environments, than ClickHouse.> The only sustainable difference between Druid and Pinot is that Pinot depends on Helix framework and going to continue to depend on ZooKeeper, while Druid could move away from the dependency on ZooKeeper. On the other hand, Druid installations are going to continue to depend on the presence of some SQL database.> Currently Pinot is optimized better than Druid. (But please read again above — “I don’t recommend to compare performance of the subject systems at all”, and corresponding sections in the post.)

This makes the course $20k which seems like a lot of money in my opinion but since big data jobs are in demand right now, it may be worth it. I am currently a Junior at my uni. What are your opinions on this? Is it a scam? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.;Questions to ask: Is it for profit? Where are the roles? What will they teach you that you aren't getting already? For 20% of any salary in 2 years it needs to be amazing. I would not do it. This sounds predatory. #Just adding a second voice, this def sounds predatory.To be fair, this sub tends to bag on opportunities, because the opportunity is not the right fit for the users here. For instance, Ravanture (or something like that) is good for folks without strong resumes, yet folks here aren't taking anything less than a Big 4 with 200k+ in RSUs. Yet, I can think of no one who needs to attend a big data course worth so much  just take one at a local school for at most 5k. When you do the math, they are pricing the course above the cost of a bootcamp (and well above the cost of any undergraduate or graduate course). In today's dollars (assuming a 2 percent inflation rate per year), the present value of the 24k cost is still about 23.26k. There aren't many bootcamps charging more than 20k, yet those charging a cost that high have a long history, proving themselves to be worth while.If this firm were trying to convince me, I would demand some alumni salary data along with comparable folks that didn't attend the course. I suspect that they don't have this data. As such, they're trying to turn a larger than normal profit on you - unless you value their promised job as something. Just take a big data course on the side, get any tech job, then network your way into the big data industry. #Thanks for the feedback. They say once I finish the course, I am guaranteed to have a job at the company they are partnered with, starting with a 60k salary. I am not sure whether or not I will enjoy working with Big Data since I am not too familiar with it yet. I haven't gotten an offer for an internship yet but I am still applying to companies every day.#Sollers seems different in the sense that the total price is very similar to revature,but revature makes no guarantee of  job compared to soller#Talk to people who have gone through the course outside of the gate keepers and handlers. Again, I think this could be great if they have a partnership but it just seems so very odd to take $ off the top.

On one hand, we have technology that is capable of identifying and storing your darkest secrets. We are capable of destroying the world. We have the highest amount of material processed per day than any prior era processed in a year. On the other hand, some guy crashed his Tesla and died because he was being an idiot. Florida has people doing stupid things on a daily basis (r/floridaman). We're trying to wage a war on violence itself. We can adapt to change, and we do.

Beyond that go utilize any of the numerous online learning sites to learn Python or R #Engineering jobs typically are branched out to include any 'engineer' title of which may include ChemE. Would suggest learning an applicable programming language namely PHP.#Was it difficult getting into that program? Did you have to do extra prereq classes? And what's it like financially? Program cost, and expectations for future career options? I'm interested in finding more analytical work and have thought an MBA or liberal arts MS could be a good path. #are you sure you didn't mean python?#I’m at Johns Hopkins Applied Economic program online (also called AAP), its a fantastic program that you have to apply for but do not need a GMAT to get into. When you go to an open house for the degree they stress that you need a very good understand of calculus, citing at least 2 years in undergrad, when I told them I was a CHE undergrad with 4 years of calculus they told me to get the pre-reqs done saying its easier to teach a person economics than it is the math to do economics.  Now I did Micro&Macro online at University of Phoenix over the summer and submitted my application by early August to get accepted.  The degree is tough, especially since you start off with not having a background in economics. The concepts are easy enough because it all boils down to finding equilibrium between supply and demand. As you progress to the software packages you are again at a slight disadvantage because you have probably never seen statistical software where you classmates probably have, although at a very high level. I remedied this by watching a lot of YouTube how-to videos on each of the programs which help immensely.Costs $4,000 per class and it takes 10 classes to obtain a degree, do not take more than 2 classes at a time. JHU offers a great student loan. What can you do with the degree? Well, let me back up, I asked what the difference is between “Applied Economics” and “Economics” MS was, the answer I obtained was that applied is geared to more analyst positions while economics generally is for researchers or more academics. The degree positions you very well for senior process engineer work or applications engineering as well as any analyst positions. When a manager asks what Applied Economics has to do with an engineering process, you would reply that you can mathematically forecast what the production will be and what input variables display a significant causality.It’s a great degree that can apply to most any field, it supplements your CHE skills with the power of statistics and math.

This role doesn't have authority over the technical support analysts on the team (of which I am one of them), but they act as the call driver whenever we have an incident arise with the services we support. Situation -- The liaison (we'll call him Jacob for this discussion) is a volunteer LEO who (I believe) has had experience as an enlisted officer. He is also incredibly smart and has proficiency in a lot of different technical areas such as *nix, networking, Windows systems, etc. etc., so at first I thought that his abrasive tone was due to him just being smart, but I'm starting to feel like he is on a power trip over me and sees me as a perp. Whenever I do something he doesn't like, he comes up to me and shows me exactly how I messed up and tells me how much it's made his job more difficult (and, mind you, it is very MINOR things). It has gotten to the point where he interrupts me when I'm talking to someone else on something he knows just so he can tell me I'm wrong. So, is this guy putting me in the mindset that I'm a threat to his authority and treating me like I'm a suspect? And if he is, how can I politely and respectfully tell him to stop treating me like I'm going to commit a crime? (I've thought of plenty of ways to tell him off in not such a nice way, but I really don't want to make things worse.)Help greatly appreciated. And thank you all for your service. ;"This doesn't sound particularly ""cop like.""If you don't like the way he's treating you, tell him that like an adult.If you're unable to resolve it between the two of you, go to your boss or HR.#No, sounds like he’s just a dick. #[deleted]#Dress exactly like him one day, and go through the entire day acting as if you ARE him. You’ll need to research this man in depth and be as accurate as possible in your impersonation. This will drive him insane and make him complain to your regional manager, to which your regional manager will allow him to make a formal written complaint with HR that will end up in a “special New York office” box.You’re welcome.#Stand up for yourself. Giving constructive criticism or feedback is essential but it sounds like this person does not know how to appropriately do that nor are they your manager. You should be treated respectfully whether it's praise or criticism. Simple as that.  Tell them to take up their problems with your supervisor as they obviously do not know how to interact with people to get the results they desire. #I literally clicked the link intending to advise OP to put the guy's stapler in jello before I realized he was serious.#Tempting..."
CryptoCurrency;894wge;1522701051.0;/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/894wge/is_cryptoblockchain_concept_dying_or_is_there/;Is crypto-blockchain concept dying? Or is there fundamental reason for it to survive?;"Does somebody really needs blockchain technology? By now I can only see people who made good money out of this madness but what's the value behind? If we correlate the money invested to the value created by now it looks as the biggest ponzi scheme ever created. Don't get me wrong, I have invested in number of coins myself with the idea to make quick money and with the hope that maybe some of them will deliver something valuable. Guess what? I did good money but when it comes to value I'm still waiting and I believe you all do. There are some interesting infrastructural projects but this is infrastructure for what?What is crypto all about? Let met think! Is it about efficiency? I don't think so! Let's consider the following: if I invest $Xmln in a new data center I will get computational power which will allow me to perform ""Y"" number of operations per second. To achieve the same over the blockchain I'll need to have access to huge number of CPUs in full power. That would cost as capital expense paid in gas over the time of the asset full amortization plus included all operational costs many times more. This is valid to the same extend when talking about big data storage. Decentralized solutions will always be less efficient then centralized because of the CAPEX and OPEX savings due to economy of scale. But is that all about efficiency? In the crypto world people always speak about decentralization. Why is that so important? Let's look at the human history via the perspective of decentralization of control and trust management. In the rise of the humanity at the end of the last ice age humans have been led by tribe chieftains. The chieftains have been accepted as the fathers of the tribe. They have been treated with respect by the others thus being the ultimate governing body for the whole tribe in all respects. They were all nomads governed by the laws of the nature. About 11000 BC - 9000 BC the first settlements appeared at the Levant and China. This led to highly populated villages that needed to be protected by the roaming nomads. The leading chieftains took the responsibility to protect the villages but for that they needed to stop working with the others. They also needed to gather an army and feed it as well as to build defence facilities. For that they ""kindly"" asked their yesterday tribe fellows to turn into farmers and start paying taxes. The rise of the centrally governed countries and the ruling elites was just about to begin. During the entire human history that followed the ancient times, the dark age, the renaissance, the industrial revolution and the current ""democratic capitalism"", humanity was constantly democratizing by decentralizing the control of the ruling elites. Is blockchain the next step in control and trust decentralization? The blockchain revolution is all about decentralization of power and interests, which brings freedom and equality of human rights to the next level of its natural development. During all of its history, people were striving for freedom and equal human rights. With every single step we are getting better in our endeavours to improve and make our society less dominated by the private interests of the few. The result is that we have never been more free then now. But why is blockchain so important in this process and its future? Blockchain is math. In the beginning the trust was delegated to different commodities and then gold and ""the gold standard"" appeared. Then ""trust"" was monopolized by the authorities run by individuals and there was no longer gold standard. We moved  the ""trust"" agency from ""something"" to ""someone"". Central and even private authorities like banks, health and other insurers, pension funds, notary offices, different clearing houses and others turned into the ultimate source of trust management nowadays. But what is ""authority"" and how it works? Central authorities are institutions created by the people and run by selected individuals empowered to take decisions on behalf of the crowd. Private authorities are centrally regulated private business companies with similar rights. Governments, tax authorities, banks, insurance companies and many others are all regulated by the law with the idea to act in best favor of the community but does that really works? Let's look at the human nature. Do you believe that people are born honest and with the time they learn dishonesty? Sounds logical doesn't it? Babies are clean as a mountain drop of water, right?  Here is the big surprise. Watch this video http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/u/kc4y0fvFHeBLVPkWJyLkHsalFs9GZuvlNIU76qyf3oHQgXObUqm5zA/. People are genetically programmed to lie for survival. Lie is one of our core survival instincts same like running or fighting depending on the situation. Lie is deeply incorporated in our brains. With the time our family and social pressure is programming us that telling the truth is a virtue and it really is. Truth is an essential component for the society to continue its development up to the next level. So we do become more honest with the time but what if it is about a bigger stake? And what if we are given the power to avoid retribution for our ""wrong"" behavior.  What if our decisions are coming at a price of high importance to us. Every person have a price at which he'll break. It might be a particular amount of money, or a bigger amount or maybe huge amount. Some people would not sell the virtues they believe in at any amount of money because they just don't value money this high but they are vulnerable when it is about something they care about more. Something of high value to them.So can we trust the authorities run by people or they would act in the best interest of....... ""them selves"", whatever their interest might be? When it comes to decisions related to their own interest people are emotional and subjective. Then how shall we shape the future of trust? The answer is hidden in mathematics. We'll shift the trust this time from ""somebody"" to ""maths"". Blockchain and more specifically the smart contracts are mathematical algorithms that helps us to avoid being in conflict of interests when we have to interpret a particular private or public agreement. Where do we need such solutions the most? If it is all about trust let's look at the industries where trust is a real challenge. This research http://www.insurancenews.com.au/local/financial-services-least-trusted-industry represents the industries and organizations enjoying the least level of trust by their community members. And the gold medalist is........... ""insurance"", followed by the entire financial sector and then the marketing is coming. Let's have a quick look at insurance and its roots.Insurance roots can be followed back to 3rd century when ship owners in ancient China came to the idea to collaborate in small groups collecting premiums to be paid in case of event thus reducing the individual risk for each ship owner. This whole concept got corrupt when the need to be scaled appeared. Less then a century later insurance was already known as ""An affiliation of pirate-gamblers who accept bets called premiums. The dollar amounts of the premiums are non-negotiable but the amounts of the claim settlements, should the company lose the bet, are rarely delivered without argument"". Nowadays insurance companies are in deep conflict of interests with their clients. Have you ever been worried that if you get hurt and have to claim insurance the insurer may try to find some reason and avoid paying especially if the amount is big? Expensive health problems abroad or at home? Real estate or car accidents, etc? Do you know how the claim payment is called in the insurers books? It's called ""loss"". Nobody wants to loose money and this is also valid for the insurance company managers and shareholders sooooo, they are ready to do whatever is needed to save the next quarter profit and if there is a way not to pay for your valid claim, they will just not pay. Remember the kids with the candies from the video above? The general idea of insurance is that it should be there when you really need it the most. But the reality is that at this very same moment you fall in deep conflict of interests with the organization that is supposed to be there when you are in trouble. This is not because insurers are bad people or their insurance math is wrong nor it is because the idea of sharing the risk between many is bad. The reason is hidden in the claim processing abuse opportunity. The claim processing in an insurance company is the procedure of collecting information and deciding weather to pay or not. But who collects the information and who takes the decision? All people getting such decisions are on payroll at the insurance companies and so they follow the instructions from their managers. Guess what happens if the company financials for the quarter doesn't goes well? But what if there is fully decentralized and transparent decision making process for the insurance industry with clear rules encoded in smart contracts and executed over the blockchain? This is what blockchain is all about and it is inevitable. Traditional insurers will not like this new reality coz they will lose the control so new players will arise and then the whales will have to follow. Insurance will be massively disrupted in the next years and in the heart of this revolution will be the decentralized claim decision making process.What about the banks? Notary offices ripping off their clients? I guess you already know the answer, but I'll cover more about that in my next article. ............................Blockchain and the crypto decentralization ideology will survive no matter what and its focus will be on trust, trust and trust only. We're now already able to afford paying the price of the new arising trustless economy by being a bit less efficient. Blockchain technology is not here for efficiency improvement. It is here to help us to decentralise the control of the ruling elites thus let us enter the new era of trustless economy where trust will no longer be subjective matter. Efficiency is important but virtues like love, trust, democracy, and freedom are and will always be way ahead in our priority list.There might be number of fluctuations  for these new arising crypto-blockchain economy within the years but the math behind will let it overcome any obstacles. This concept is next step in the evolution of the human kind and there is zero chance to be blocked by the current ruling elites dominating most of the governments worldwide. The domain will be regulated to some extend but will not be stopped. The long history of human kind is the best advocate for my claim.";That's probably the biggest waste of time you've ever committed to something.#anyway you can shorten this down so I can respond?#Tl dr...#Dead#I'm so glad I stopped reading like 3 lines in. #It's not a question.

I just know this pc is capable of smooth graph rotation since i got QT based win app on dual boot that does it smoothly.Thanks for suggestions.;For more heavy-duty visualisation, try VTK. It has a steeper learning curve though. In fact, for a quick visualisation, try Paraview (or maybe Mayavi) - these are both VTK GUI frontends.https://www.paraview.org/#Try VisJS. It’s JavaScript based but I was able to generate the JSON it requires from Python. Edit: VisJS, not GraphVis.Here's an example of the 3D plots it can do:http://visjs.org/graph3d_examples.html#all i need to do is 3d surface plot with 1024x1024 numpy array ...i ll look into it thanksedit : mayavi is just what i needed, thanks again#thanks for info but if there is pure python solution i wont go for javascript if it aint necessary#Yeah that's very easy in vtk.  Vrk is the backend package that you can include in an application.  Mayavi and paraview are wrappers around vtk that also include scripting, but have their own gui.Your case sounds pretty basic in vtk.  Soet of depends what you want beyond simple static visualization like animated gifs or fringe plots, etc.Either way, vtk is super fast and comes with almost everything, so it can be hard to find anything.

But I'll vouch for University of Waterloo as a good school for mathematics for one particular reason if nothing else: of all the graduate & undergraduate students on campus, ~21% of them are part of the Math faculty. That's a lot of funding, campus space, lecturers/researchers, and a large peer group to work within if you wish to immerse yourself in a culture of mathematics, and meet others who will do the same.A comparatively larger and perhaps better-known institution, University of Toronto, has [27 Master's students in mathematics](http://www.math.toronto.edu/cms/graduate-program/potential-students-grad/introduction-to-the-mathematics-graduate-program/), and 139 total graduate students in math when you account for the PhD candidates. By contrast, [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/institutional-analysis-planning/university-data-and-statistics/student-data/student-headcounts) has 44 doing a Master's in *Statistics*, over 400 doing a Master's in the math faculty, and over 750 total graduate students in mathematics including the PhD students. I know quantity isn't everything, but it does serve to show that Waterloo treats its math faculty as a point of pride and focus, which some people find good for their morale. It does make it rather competitive though, and if someone doesn't feel motivated by the prestige, the environment can be pretty taxing at times.I will say, most people get a pretty immediate reaction as soon as they get to campus: either they feel at-home, or they desperately want to leave and never return. Everyone I've spoken to that followed their gut feeling was happy they did, one way or the other. As such, I'd recommend visiting and talking to some students or faculty if you are even considering it. If you want to message me, I can offer the email of a math-faculty recruiter who can answer any questions you may have, far better than I can. She deals with a lot of applicants from outside of Canada, and she's also a very sweet lady that I've known for years.Canada overall, and Waterloo in particular is a pretty interesting place to be, but that is very much my personal bias speaking.Just my personal musing, but bailing on an offer after you've accepted seems a bit rude, but that's about it. On the other hand, any respected program probably has more applicants than they can take, so someone will get offered that spot and be happy about it. The university would probably rather have students that are invested 100% in their program, rather than someone who's there just to be polite. And ultimately, a university is a business that you do not owe anything to, and your best investment in yourself is to seek the best opportunity available, wherever that is. Indirectly though, your success is what brings credibility to whichever institution you earned your undergrad at, so if you owe your current school anything, you should feel compelled to take the best chance at your own success, regardless of what school/job that takes you to after your undergrad. The market value of a university's degree is it's reputation, which is gained from having successful and respected alumni. That's why I like to speak well about University of Waterloo to prospective students and colleagues even though I am no longer a student. I want my degree to maintain its credibility when I can't shape the academic environment personally, I want the current students to enjoy the same respect I did when I attended, and I feel all warm and fuzzy about giving back some positive exposure to the environment that affected my education (because they certainly aren't getting any monetary donations from me in the near future, still chasing my own success first.)#Uoft, UBC and Waterloo all have very well-regarded statistics programs. If your goal is a Phd, I'd recommend UBC or Waterloo over Uoft since their programs require you to write a thesis while Uoft's is purely coursework.  Disclaimer: I am an undergrad at Uoft and will likely do my Masters here.#I'm at UofT and one thing I tell you for sure is that we have some of the best researchers in the fields of AI and ML if you're interested in that stuff.#[deleted]#Yeah the Master's program is 1-year of coursework. The stats web page says ""There is no thesis component, however, students are encouraged to take one project based course if they are considering going on to a PhD."" You can check it out here: http://utstat.toronto.edu/?page_id=1462So you will be exposed to research at the Master's level with a prof in a project based course so you have a shot at PhD programs. A number of students from UofT MSc in Stats will go on to PhD's so you don't need to worry too much. Worse case scenario if you don't get into the PhD program, you spend a year after your MSc doing research. It's the same time frame as if you took a 2 year thesis program, but instead you would be paid more as a Research Assistant than what you would have made as a grad student."

This kind of tech workers, who have a passion for the work they do, have a mutualistic relationship with the startups. They thrive in the turbulent and dynamic atmosphere of a new business, as they are usually home to many exciting decisions and opportunities. And if you are an entrepreneur who is currently gathering up a crew for your bright idea, you’re going to need people like them who share your level of enthusiasm.This article is not about merits of such minds, as I don’t think this is news for anyone out there. I will assume you already have a decent gang who wants to create cool things. It will be about one of the possible tendencies of such ambitious craftsmen, something that could pose a risk to the success of your venture that you should be wary about. Simply, **over-engineering**.## Roman Aqueduct ArgumentThe concept of over-engineering, building things in an unnecessarily complicated manner that will give you no benefit regarding reaching your targets  or ignoring **YAGNI** principle, spending time to add features **you ain’t gonna need** are traps to be avoided in every case of development. But for startups on a tight schedule that needs to act fast on present opportunities, these mistakes could be the difference between life-death depending on costs.Let’s go a step further. Think about the Roman aqueducts. Pinnacles of construction, aren’t they? They’ve been standing for thousands of years, while their contemporaries are lost in time. But is it a good idea to build something that you won’t be able to benefit from for the overwhelming majority of its lifespan? Dare I say it, is this a case of bad engineering? I don’t know if that would be fair, but Romans had the luxury to build those just to say fuck you to other civilisations throughout history. As a startup, you probably don’t. So let alone unnecessary complications or unneeded features, sometimes even building things to last, when they don’t suppose to, might be a bad idea.## How Can I Tell Something is Unnecessary?Well, you can’t sadly. Best you could do is challenging your developers for explanations of decisions with an apparent significant cost. Little pieces of complexities that no one can see without looking at the code should be manageable and trusting your teammates should be your first instinct either way. If you don’t have confidence in them to make the right decisions after a meaningful conversation, you’re either approaching things the wrong way or have the wrong teammates. What I’m going to do in this article is to help you out by listing few of the costly attractive concepts that should raise your eyebrow and trigger some of those conversations.# These are Bad Ideas (Except When They’re Not)### 1. You don’t need MICRO SERVICESThis is the big one. Oh yes, you definitely don’t need micro-services. Whatever the reason, you just don’t need it. But, but, to be scalabl- NO! It’s simply impossible for a startup to have microservices as a viable architecture initially. The operational complexity that comes with it, handling of transactions, and all other hardships that are a part of distributed computing are in no way a meaningful tradeoff for their benefits to any company trying to get its bearings. Especially without having a robust dev-ops infrastructure with good monitoring capabilities, you’re **guaranteed** to suffer for choosing microservices.Encourage your developers who are very adamant about using micro-services to create **stateless, loosely coupled** systems. When done right, they could be broken apart into their components in necessity.### 2. You don’t need BIG DATAAnother still popular buzz-word that peaked around 2015 is **big data**. It’s a vague concept in the way that it could mean a variety of things but doesn’t matter. First of all, ask yourself this: do you have any data at all right now, let alone big data? Yes, you have big ambitions. Yes, your venture will one day rule the world, and ruling the world comes with worlds of data. But until you do, you probably won’t need any tools and tech that provide solutions comes under the umbrella of big data.An average new business with a reliable financial forecast usually breaks even around three years. So, common sense says, even in the very rare case of everything going just the way you expect them to, you’re going to have some time until you have some users who will cause some big discussions regarding data access.### 3. You don’t need DATA MININGThis one is a little bit different, in that it’s not just a technique but more of a feature. So this could be thought also as a business decision rather than a strictly technical one. There two things to consider about data mining before going down this road. First, just like in the case of big data, you’re going to need some data to mine. Second, standard features that are enabled through data mining are usually complementary features that feed into your core business. So until you are sure that your core features are working as expected, and there are enough people using them, delay spending some time and money on data mining.Well, of course, there are obvious exceptions. Your business could be making use of already available data. Or analysing other people’s data could be the central part of your value proposition. In those cases just pretend I didn’t say anything.##What Do You Need, Then?You could encourage your IT team to spend some time on a **CI platform**, shortening your feedback loop from the very start. This should be easy enough and should make things comfortable for pivoting. Or make sure everything is **stateless** and **loosely coupled**, as it will make it easier to build on your foundations when things start to get complicated. Of course, there will be a time and place for the concepts in this article to make sense for you. You’ll just need to make sure your crew contains their excitement and waits for the right time.;"I can say as a developer for the 24 years and founder of a *successful* (operative word here folks...my expectations of success might vary from yours) company for the last 11+ years that this piece really resonates with me.  My partner (also a dev and founder) and I wrote our initial MVP software over a period of 8-1/2 months back in 2007.  Back then, we wanted to add various things and always had reign in our expectations versus our amount of runway (it wasn't much - about 13-15 months).  When it's your (or your investors') money on the line, if you don't absolutely need it, don't build it!  If you are able to give your vision legs and the market responds favorably, there will be time to go back and rewrite or augment these things later.  I would add another caveat to this list:  don't chase trends when it comes to technology.  Pick a technology stack you are familiar with that is capable of doing the job and stable.  Make sure it's got an established community if open source with some release history.  A fledgling company can't afford to invest time rewriting major systems in every flavor of the month.  Pick what works and again, once you're successful, you can stand up a new environment to demo or prototype cool new languages or libraries.  Your only goal should be getting that MVP finished and stable without incorporating every Silicon Valley tech flavor of the rainbow...  I was fortunate in that we got our MVP released (it was close to failure a number of times) and our business established.  Years later, I've got a development staff and huge amount of resources to play with so I can do R&D with some of the newer stuff but it rarely makes the transition to our production code base.  I always think back to those early days and all the things we thought the market wanted and then ask myself ""Will this feature sell?  How many of our customers really would use it?  Is it something the salespeople can understand and sell?  Will marketing be able to distill this new feature down to a coherent message?""  Your message is spot on...#One of the worst companies I ever worked in was one where the project manager was obsessed with microservices. We were constantly building stuff that never got used  constantly deadlocked by other developers' work. Eventually, half of the staff left.The CTO of Uber gave a really interesting talk about how much he regretted going with microservices. They also had the problem of hiring too many engineers too quickly, so that might have played into it as well."

I've dabbled into various other things like BI, C#, javascript stuff but I always anchored my core in databases. Unfortunately I didn't follow the times close enough and I think the real fun and valuable work now in 'data' are either big data, data engineering or ML/AI/data science work. Now I'm thinking of switching and it's not been that easy. I've got 3 options for me (1) chug along my current job and get some management experience (2) switch teams to our internal big data team (3) get a foot into a real tech company.Option 3 is the most ideal but also hardest without any relevant experience in the subject. Also likely a pay cut since it will be a more junior role. Option 2 is the next most ideal but I'm beginning to dislike this company so wanna get out if possible. Option 1 is the most socially acceptable path and money wise it's there best for now but I've come to terms that I'll care less about this for now. I've been broiling over this for the last 3 months and trying to self improve from coursera, side projects, self learning python, applying to jobs, schools and bootcamps, talking to mentors on top of my day job it's really taking its toll. What should I do?? My main focus right now is just to remain hireable in the burgeoning tech fields.;What is your current job? Also what isn’t your current industry and what are your degrees in? Data is incredibly expansive and vital. I think you should continue to learn, work on your side projects and keep covering the different areas. It seems like you’re already well versed in data engineering and data governance. You may have to commit to one data area in terms of the industry. Ml/AI/ and data science is all more on the analytics side and separate data engineering and etl. Also it’s crazy competitive. If money isn’t an issue I would still try to build up my skills in all these areas but try to have a central focus as to which Side of the entire data ecosystem you want to focus on. Because you may get hired for a specific data role, let’s say in big data just as an example, but you’ll be able to integrate some of the other areas like analytics and applications development.Also, don’t go to a data boot camp. Unless it’s  more of a fellowship than a bootcamp(like what insight does) or its free(unlikely).#Thank you for your response. I'm currently in data warehousing in finance industry, my degree is in comp sc. Techniques we use are relatively dated. The work is business heavy and less tech savvy hence learning less from the tech perspective. From a data engineering standpoint I'd like to move to a role where I can learn the big data stack and the current generation of tools properly.You're right the ML/AI is competitive and fundamentally different than databases or data engineering. I guess I'll continue to learn. #Do you actually want to stay in finance though. That's sort of what I'm doing right now, big data, data engineering, and data analytics.#I don't, that's why I want to join a tech company

This is the opposition of your view, and it's up to you if you **value** the following levels.&nbsp #Personal levelOn a personal level, your data leak (and even data permanence - your data remaining on the internet for the end of time) can be quite bad for your security and reputation (companies will use data like that to discriminate against you, or if not them personally, the algorithms will) and you will be at a disadvantage compared to never posting online at that day. It's a chance, it might come back to haunt you. It's not even paranoia, just do this experiment at work: Google the name of a person at work, and see just how much you can find. Also, google your name.Not to mention if you have people that are malignant towards you that wish to cause you harm. You don't have to go in politics for this to be an issue, and make you uncomfortable.As a summary, the ""commodities"" here are:- Privacy- Security- ReputationThey are not impacted HEAVILY, but slightly, and gradually.#Manipulation levelI think people grossly underestimate the impact of algorithms in their live, and just how easily we are manipulated by the choices we make. A note here, a product that has good marketing and good use of your data is not necessarily a good product for you, the consumer. So the argument that you like seeing ads, is questionable from my view. If you wish to buy something, you know what you want, and you will get it.#Future level - AIThis is a threat that will start to ramp up slowly but steadily, but we have seen its effects.Even if big data is tremendously big, so will the processing power and methods to parse it will grow bigger and bigger through AI tech. That AI tech will only grow in the power it has over you, and we don't know if this AI falls in the wrong hands, or if the AI itself is benevolent or not. It's risky in the long term, since we have evidence of it ramping up during our lifetime.&nbsp Overall, in my view,I think it's good to put some little effort to develop good data behaviors and habits, so in this sense it is advantageous for your development to ""care"" a bit about these issues, in order to avoid potential risks.How much effort is the best match, that depends on many variables, but I am pretty sure it is almost impossible for the right answer to be ""0 effort"" (meaning, not caring at all).#>  so that that company can manipulate the public into voting for a particular canadite?""Fake news"" isn't a new concept, and targeted adds towards individuals isn't any different than 20 years ago when we targeted ads towards groups through TV or Radio.#[deleted]"

However, I do not see a class based strictly on machine learning. Does machine learning play a big enough role in this field to justify learning it over summer? I would also appreciate if someone can explain how they use machine learning in their day to day workflow. ;there are resources online for quickly developing a basic understanding of ML, and probably enough to hold a decent conversation about it with whoever you'll be working with in the futurei took this one, doesnt require a lot of time and its pretty informative https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/03/05/you-can-take-googles-machine-learning-crash-course-for-free-now/  #It really depends on the role. There are plenty of roles within the Data realm that don’t require any knowledge of machine learning. #I'll look into it, thanks
cscareerquestions;86by7r;1521729337.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/86by7r/figured_id_ask_here/;Figured I’d ask here.;I’m stuck in a rut. Got into tech after college (graduated with a BS in Psychology) working with a data & analytics company for almost 5 years. Took a SQL class & got a job with one of the big banks. Started as a contractor & now I’m FTE. The problem is, I feel stuck & bored. All jobs I’m finding require a lot more than I have experience with & I want to learn more to further myself & my career. I’ve always wanted to transition more into back-end or Big Data jobs but dk if I should go back to get my CS degree or go the certifications route. Any suggestions on how someone who isn’t a CS major get more into the field? I’m open to anything. Thanks in advance & I love this sub :-);>Thanks in advance & I love this sub :-)Thanks for posting. On behalf of the mods we love you too. >I want to learn more to further myself & my career.Awesome>I’ve always wanted to transition more into back-end or Big Data jobs but dk if I should go back to get my CS degree or go the certifications route. What areas of back end? Anything more specific? Does your firm do anything here in this area that you can look internally to potentially shadow. That would be my first start at work. Sub wise there are some datascience specific ones that have some pretty awesome FAQs that you can check our FAQ to see. #Thanks for responding :-) I really like the behind scenes of databases or just how things are built & maintained in general. I’ve been looking into Python, Ruby. Used SPSS & SASS in college but not since. Had a good friend tell me about Hadoop. I’ve familiar with some front end (HTML & CSS) but back end is more interesting to me. Since I’m FTE now, I have no ties with my contracting firm unless I say I’m looking again. My employer however, while there are opportunities I feel like they are giving me the run around & in the midst of a re-org. It’s been going on for close to a year but my patience is running thin. I’ll def check the FAQ section. #>I feel like they are giving me the run around & in the midst of a re-org. This definitely happens and it is a good idea to get ahead of it. I'd even check local meetups and universities for discussions as bouncing ideas off of someone in person is significantly easier to do. #The meetup scene in my city is so yuck. Ppl say they will show up but don’t but hey I’ll give it another shot. Thankfully I have a few friends in tech that I met & they have mentioned just learning another programming language. Nothing else really :-/

Simce Equifax scare;After the big data breach last year with Equifax, I got an awesome  tip to freeze all 3 credit accounts with each provider. Equifax, Experian and Transunion. ( yes I know the wording of this last statement may not be correct as in , its not an account, etc).Weirdly my Chase and Wells Fargo still report my Fico credit score each month for free.. But it s always within 2 points 787-789. It never changes. Are they just going on old data or can they supersede my freezes?Thanks again for the great info!! I cant find the answer online and I know we have some great finance professionals here! ;Freezing your credit reports only prevents new forms of credit from being opened.  Your existing creditors (credit cards, loans, etc..) can continue reporting your balances and payments.  It's possible enough has remained the same with your credit reports that your score hasn't changed.#Freezes only affect new tradelines/queries.Existing business relationships can pull/report through freezes.So the thing with your FICO continuing to be reported and updated is normal.#Great to know!  Thanks a bunch for the information!#Awesome! So thats why Its still reporting.Great to know. Thank you!

socialmedia;864ny4;1521658114.0;/r/socialmedia/comments/864ny4/are_the_social_media_platforms_to_blame_for_other/;Are the social media platforms to blame for other people misusing them?;[Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/connectedanddisaffected/s2e18-countering-hate-ft-jason-carmel) discussing the dark and light sides of big data and advocacy. On one side, you have [We Counter Hate](https://wecounterhate.com/), a new campaign designed to flag and counteract hate speech on Twitter. On the other, you have the shady electioneering of Cambridge Analytica.The platforms themselves are beginning to take the bulk of the criticism. But is that fair? Or are they technologies that people should be able to use as they want?**[Podcase link here](https://soundcloud.com/connectedanddisaffected/s2e18-countering-hate-ft-jason-carmel)**;The platforms have an ethical responsibility to ensure the data they collect and make accessible is protected in a way that minimizes harm (which means they probably need binding contracts specifying how and when data can be used by developers, and they need to be far more clear with their users how and to whom this data is being released). That doesn't inherently make them responsible when the data is misused, but their hands aren't completely clean in this. They (along with just about every company these days) do a pretty terrible job protecting user/consumer data.This is the new reality, and yes, we need to adapt to ensure data is secure and not misused. The people who hold the keys and who have the pragmatic capabilities to monitor how the data is being used should do that voluntarily  alternatively, they'll likely be forced to by some regulatory agency.At the same time, organizations like CA have ethical responsibilities too. At the end of the day, the platforms themselves are just middlemen. Where there is demand, there will be supply. If not Facebook, it will be some other platform. We must also put the light on people/organizations that are hellbent on manipulating people unethically for disproportionate gain. I would put my focus on these organizations over Facebook or other platforms, because they're ultimately the ones with unethical intentions.#But won't there always be companies finding loopholes if you don't make the platforms close those loopholes?For me, the tricky thing is saying who has the authority to weigh in on this. These are American companies but they operate all over the world. Is that personal data contained by national borders? Can any organisation police that?

I think my current 5-10 year goal is to finish my studies, then work in some sort of big data / machine learning setting, and eventually attempt a start up using my knowledge of AI.Does a thesis give me better insight to things I would use in practical situations, or am I better of doing courses?;For something like machine learning which I would go for a program  that requires a thesis because it would provide an opportunity to gain some practical experience. The difference between a masters thesis and a PhD dissertation are pretty significant though and I wouldn't suggest a PhD unless you are passionate about research and ready to spend many years on the same project with minimal supervision and help.#I guess by practical experience you mean research experience? I understand that the thesis will be a lot of digging into a specific topic and learning things related to it. I guess I'm wondering if this is more valuable then getting more of a breadth of knowledge, because obviously I won't be constrained to a single problem / type of ML algorithm my whole career.

Drugs;89g812;1522776420.0;/r/Drugs/comments/89g812/the_big_data_have_the_potential_to_be_a/;The Big Data have the potential to be a treacherous weapon against drug users;"Please dont read this if you are high right now, you could potentially get paranoid. We are not in danger today, but could be in the future. Its all hypothetical, not yet a reality. Big data is basically a giant amount of data stored of virtually anything, including social media and search engines. Together with data annalists and artificial intelligence, it can get conclusions that would be impossible to simple human beings. If done right, it can conclude and deduct things about someone like [potential illness](http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/01/pf/data-consumer-health/index.html) or [things that not even your loved ones knew about it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#65c5ce6b6668).Hypothetically, if you are reading this you are probably a drug user. If you are a drug user, there is great odds that you have/had anxiety, depression or adhd.If an AI could potentially learn about someones: *disorders + your search history + your behavior on social media + data that for us humans don't seems to have no relevance but actually says a lot*, it could, in theory, safely deduct that you use illicit drugs, therefore a criminal in the eyes of law.You can argue that if used like this, the Big Data would be used against dealers and cartels only. But in the War on Drugs the user is the main victim. And if it were used this way, the user would be targeted as well.We are totally safe for now. Obviously its not a ""conspiration"" against us or anything like that. But just imagine this power in the hands of a [blood thirsty assassin like Rodrigo Duterte, president of the Phillippines](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/senator-rodrigo-duterte-drug-war-killed-20000-180221134139202.html). ";"Woke.  #lol. Im not trying to look paranoid. If you read more about the IT area you will see that its really a possibility. Its not conspirational theory ""they are working against us"" or anything. #Edited a bit to look less ""conspiratory"".Big data is a real thing with academic and economic relevance on the IT area.

It almost requires one to approach all situations without assumption or bias in order for the phenomena to present without the influence of preconception.

I try to account for the maximum amount of variables so I can at least accurately understand my own bias or the bias of the frame I have constructed to tease insight from data.

I haven't seen anything on this Cambridge Analytica scandal here and I'm wondering what you all think about it? Personally, I think the Facebook data mining is pretty overblown but [the Channel 4 undercover expose is completely shocking and disgusting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpbeOCKZFfQ), the CEO basically brags about incredibly corrupt tactics the firm uses to manipulate elections and discusses how the firm used big data to set Trump's electoral strategy and campaign speeches.**So what do you guys think about it?**;Personally I really doubt Trump is the first to use shady firms like this to gain the upper hand. It wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if using firms like this was already the political norm. That said, this shit is completely reprehensible and we need to set a strong deterrent against using these kinds of tactics. The entire senior team of this firm + whoever in Trump's campaign set this up should rot in prison to set a message imo.

I am from Sweden and working for a medium big Big Data company mostly administrating Hadoop and Elastic search with surrounding applications to work with that.I have worked here 11 months now with decent salary, but last week I got a phone call from a recruiter in UK again (When i got this job i was contacted by a UK recruitment firm) This time was different tho, they are looking for someone to work as a Big Data SysAdm in London with a pay that is 2x more than i have currently.This would involve a move from Sweden to London since i am single and don't really have any commitments here it would be possible but it is kinda ""Scary"" to just move to another country to work without being 100% about everything.So what I am asking is tips, have any of you moved like this to work? Tips and tricks? Questions to ask to be sure about everything, and how is it to move to London of all places.I already told them to even think of it I would need a Moving Package from their side and from the sound of it that would be no issue.";Go  with your gut feeling. how much will this new job potentially benefit you? Are you leaving family and friends behind? Is that important to you in life?Do not just go chasing the money, chances are something with good pay will happen in your current country.

Does a program exist already?;"Is there a website that lets us view a year or more temperature/humidity sensor data from a CSV file?              It sounds like something someone may have already written, given the number of available sensors on the market.I've got a SensorPush model it has a data viewer Android app, but it's lacking a ""select a section"" zoom, and an overlay of weekly results. It's also not on my PC!         So I exported the data - and it's in the CSV format of:               >""Timestamp"",""Temperature_Celsius"",""Relative_Humidity""                ""2017-05-06 12:34"",""22.99"",""36.45""                ""2017-05-06 12:35"",""23.34"",""43.53""                ""2017-05-06 12:36"",""23.39"",""43.04""                ""2017-05-06 12:37"",""23.38"",""42.83""                ""2017-05-06 12:38"",""23.35"",""42.74""                ""2017-05-06 12:39"",""23.30"",""42.68""                ""2017-05-06 12:40"",""23.24"",""42.71""                Hah, quotes around the floats!So the data:           It's an ASCII CSV file.         There's a years worth of data - 500,000 items, sampled ever minute.           Each record is : ISO standard date and time, and two series.                      I'm hoping there's something that can navigate a chart of that data as one long linear one... and zoom in to places of interest.     Another display the program should do is overlay the data into week chunks so I can compare temperature changes.If not - I was thinking of putting together a website that lets anyone with generic sensor data to upload it!So my other main question is - what JavaScript ""Big Data"" charting software does anyone recommend?Thanks for your time!";Spreadsheet programs like MS Excel or Libreoffice Calc are made for this and will happily load your CSV.The standard JavaScript library for charting is [D3](https://d3js.org). There are many others a Google search away.

I have interviewed some people who works in Big Data in local banks and IT. Now I'm looking for an expert outside my country to complement my work.Here are my 5 questions:1. How often do you see Big Data in companies? It's used widely or in very specific companies?2. How much has improved a company after implementing something related to Big Data?3. Is there any requisites for a company to roll out a Big Data architecture?4. What software / hardware do you work with5. Do you think we'll get, at some point, to a volume of data that obliges companies to use Big Data?Thank you in advance, and sorry for my English its not my native language. ;Hello!

I've set up a home server to do data storage for my wife and me, a Ubuntu Server machine running ZFS with about 6TB available space. This works great for in-place data integrity and storage, and I'm really happy with it.However, I'm trying to figure out the best way to do off-site backups for our data. If our apartment burns down, I'd be really upset if we lost all of our photos, financial docs, etc.Obviously this is a big amount of data for a home backup solution, so I've done a bit of research into personal cloud and more exotic pooling filesystems. One hard requirement is encryption, at least for some of the data (I don't really care about encrypting photos, but documents I do).I've boiled it down to two options (but if you have another idea, please let me know!!!):* Backblaze/etc ""traditional"" backup using their $5/mo unlimited plan -- can select a folder on the server and back it up.* Backblaze/etc ""cloud"" backup using their paid/per/GB cloud service, with a tool like Restic which does file deduplication and compression, snapshotting, etcWith ""option 1"", the benefits:* Easy restore -- no custom tools required. In 15 years if I die in a fire and my wife needs to restore, she doesn't have to be looking up Linux command line arguments* Encrypted, with the additional optional of a user-specified key* Relatively cheapCons:* No pooling/compression automatically* No snapshotting, file-level versioning (I don't think)* Encryption key managementWith ""option 2"", the benefits:* Really nice features like file-level versioning, pooling, etc* Personalized, non-Backblaze-managed encryption which is independently vetted* Charged per GB, and is actually cheaper than their other optionCons:* Custom software (Restic) relied on* Encryption key management* No ability to ""view and download"" easily -- restore requires a linux box to handle the pooled filesystemSo, my specific questions/suggestion requests:* Of these two options or styles of options, what makes the most sense as a family data off-site backup solution?* How should keys be managed? I was thinking of writing it on a flash drive and a piece of paper and storing in a bank lock box, but is there another way?* Any other gotcha's that I'm not thinking of?";"If your wife is not tech savvy or you cannot just let her instructions on how to restore a Restic Backup from BlackBlaze then what I would do is to buy a HDD big enough to store all your data, format it and encrypt it with LUKS or something like that and then make periodic backups with rsync (using -va option so it will not delete old files and it'll actually act as a backup and not sync) to this HDD. This way you can just store this HDD in a safe place where you can just grab it in a case of emergency and if you do at least weekly backups, in the worst case scenario you'll just lose one week of documents. However, I personally don't trust in just one backup method. My computer is setup to backup hourly with Back in Time for documents, a second full backup for my system, a third backup with Borg for not just documents but also VMs and everything and another online backup with Restic.Restic does not have compression option  however, it does have deduplication and in some cases is even better than compression. I don't really trust on companies doing the encryption. If you trust it, then also there's Mega. Mega have Linux client and claim to be end to end encrypted. Also there's Spideroak that also have a backup tool. Mega don't have a backup tool I think but I read recently that they're doing file versioning.Restic is a great tool. I think I would do the Restic option. If you're using Restic maybe you could consider another option for storage that can be cheaper, like Google Drive. If you don't care if a service can see your photos unencrypted, then your solution is Google Photos. You can backup all your photos there and if you convert them into their format it doesn't consume any space from your plan. Doing that you can dramatically reduce the size of your backup. Maybe if you have 6TB of data and your photos are 3TB or 4TB, then you can pay for just 2 or 3TB for your documents backup, which will make a really big difference in the price of your online storage. Overall, like I said, Restic is a really great tool and with simple script and a cron job you can have an excellent and secure tool for your backups.About managing keys, I don't know why you need to store it in a bank but if you do that, then print it. You don't know how much time that will be there so... You don't know if a USB can be reliable stored for years maybe. Also, it is worth checking out rsync.net for cloud storage. They also have backup solutions and if you have your own tools, you can ssh. One great tool that I really like for backups is Back in Time. Back in Time is really easy to use, I use it for my wife and I know she understand it well, it support encryption but is Encfs and some people say is not reliable. I've been using Encfs for years now with Dropbox and it has never fails me but it does not hide size of files. I don't care much about that but some people do. Anyways, Back in Time is awesome for documents and pictures, it has ssh option and I thing rsync cloud with back in time would be like having the dead crash plan but you actually have your own encryption method. As far as I know, rsync is really awesome in support. I don't know think I've wrote too much. So good luck. #Thanks for the detailed reply this long after the post! What I decided on was to use Restic on Backblaze B2, with the keys kept in a safe place. I'm not really concerned about protecting my data from ""big bad actors"", more just if a big hack happens and a ton of data is siphoned, mine is encrypted and harder to get than others.The idea of ""store in a bank"" was more just ""store in a place less likely to burn down than my house"" than ""store it in a secure place.""#lol, yeah, sorry for the testament.

To put this in perspective, consider the fact that famous theorists always use courseware to overcome this obstacle. With EKBOW, we are seeking forward-thinking submissions that demonstrate the technical unification of DHTs and DHTs, which embodies the robust principles of embedded electrical engineering. Thusly, game-theoretic technology and object-oriented languages offer a viable alternative to the understanding of Boolean logic.Important dates:Drafts due: April 8, 2018Notification of acceptance: June 5, 2018Final submissions due: August 2, 2018Conference date: September 25, 2018Keynotes:* Prof. Bennie Ali - University of WyomingA understanding of IPv7* Sandi Webb - University of Western AustraliaImportant unification of DHTs and Markov models* Dr. Katarina Fuller - University of FloridaA understanding of courseware* Claudine Villa - Colorado School of MinesUnderstanding of courseware* Rebecca Parrish - Shiraz UniversityKey unification of web browsers and agentsTopics:Cloud-based networkingIndependently noisy hardware and architecture, and partitioned e-voting technologyMarkov high-performance computingProgram Committee Members:Laurie Glass - Nanjing Agricultural UniversityGuo Dalton - Aarhus UniversityPast EKBOW locations:Mingguang, ChinaGenova, ItalySteering Committee:Noam Phelps, Chiang Mai UniversityAs one of the appropriate conferences of the 2015 conference on heterogeneous, vertical modalities, EKBOW is committed to being a colloquium for answering the key challenges in the emulation, synthesis, and evaluation of the understanding of the memory bus and collaborative modalities. Certainly, cutting-edge revisions are asked for on steganography, randomized electrical engineering, and high-performance computing. The symposium also tries at rendering a colloquium for interchanging groundbreaking works from information theorists and futurists on technologies to evaluate game-theoretic big data. Obviously, this special issue intends to explore a multimodal tool for enabling public-private key pairs, disproving that kernels and IPv4 with 64 bit architectures are regularly incompatible.We are delivering you this accouncement, anticipating that you will consider submitting several revisions to EKBOW. The special session happens in Shizuoka, Japan on October 13, 2018.

Seems like most people in AI — big chip developers especially — are banking on the assumption that the future of AI will require exponentially more computational power than what is available today. Basically just a big data and computations arms race. But what if that’s like thinking in 1901 that the only way to improve transportation was to figure out how to strap 40 horses to a wagon, instead of 4? What’s the AI equivalent of the internal combustion engine? As this article points out, assuming AI gets more and more computationally intense is full of many problems. From the costs to the inefficiencies to how invasive the data is, it doesn’t seem like the only path forward.Would love to hear people’s thoughts on where AI might be headed, and your take on the other types of data structures that might be out there, like the ‘canonicals’ mentioned in this article. Does AI need to be able to reason abstractly? https://medium.com/mind-ai/what-if-the-next-breakthrough-in-ai-doesnt-depend-on-massive-computing-power-cbdf9740a8f1;"I think AI on the contrary will need less data in the future.\- Why do people say it will require more and more computational power ?It is clear that today a lot of companies are talking up the goods of combining big data and artificial intelligence to make better models, and a lot of research done by these companies try to improve the way we manipulate huge data resources and the computing power. But ... as you pointed out, big chips developers like to say that, and big data sellers like to say that. Because it makes their business. Nevertheless, we can only enjoy the fact to have more power at our disposal, but we certainly don't want to use this power at it's maximum for basic applications. We, ( as people who does not have interest in selling chips and data ) can only hope for better algorithms that require less data to be efficient.\- Why do I think it will require less data ?Because our brain requires so few data to be efficient. There are no reason we can't do better with AI. This being said, the paths that could lead toward it are certainly numerous. To my mind, it is a matter of better linking different mathematical point of view that'll make us see the big picture.1. I think understanding the whole learning process of different algorithms as bayesian inferences could help us compare the algorithms with our brain ( as a lot of successful research compared the learning process of our brain  to bayesian inferences -> see Stanislas Dehaene work ) and maybe give us hints on how to learn with less data.2. Develloping general paradigms for learning like reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning ( today only a few companies seem to be interested in reinforcement learning because it is hard to apply in real world applications ).3. Better understanding the differences between how a neural network learns and how our brain learns. We saw through different failures of neural nets that they weren't quite acting like our brain (i.e adversarial examples that fools networks are absolutely well identified by us !). Some of these failure certainly shows that we miss something big.&#x200B It will be an exiting journey !#Dont get me wrong, i love thinking about this stuff but by no means do i know anything real about it.I feel like it could, but do you want 100% accuracy or do you want to mimic human intelligence.Organic beings tend to skip a ton of steps once we have learned something but will often make tons and tons of mistakes, the majority that you dont even realize because your senses wont pick it up or they will just tell you that you were right and keep on going forward. However, as explained in a different comment, ""AI"" today does stats really well and more flops means more data processing and if statements which is basically what it does ( i think). also, these computers need to store this ""learned"" info so there it tons of storage issues that we are going to need to figure out too. Im not sure what the human data storage for the brain is estimated at but i bet a big room of AWS servers is exponentially more. So to end my rant i feel as if we can get the skipping steps part down it could be ""easy"" but do we really want that in a computer AI?#I think this is a misleading question, the article is mainly a piece explaining why we should focus on AI away from computional intensity. The question whether or not it is possible is a completely different question. It seems that AI is moving to push for computational intesity to quickly try and develop the technology after which it would then probably will try to decrease the actual computation cost after the AI goals have been reached.&#x200B I do see the need to move to less computation power need in AI but I m skeptical on the actual timeline.#> that’s like thinking in 1901 that the only way to improve transportation was to figure out how to strap 40 horses to a wagon, instead of 4?Not quite. The difference is that advances in AI/ML are helping us build faster, more power-efficient computer chips (which, in turn, helps us crunch bigger AI/ML problems, cheaper). So, it's a virtuous circle. In the short term, yes, we are going to just throw tons and tons of compute cycles at AI/ML. The reason this is a big deal is that businesses can calculate the total cost-of-ownership (or amortize through a dedicated compute-services provider, such as AWS) of compute hardware. By contrast, calculating the total cost of paying web developers to design and roll out a new web service is a lot like astrology. When a business can take a problem it needs to solve and turn it into a sliding scale of an objective measurable versus dollars... that's a big deal. And AI/ML packages + raw compute horsepower is enabling businesses in many sectors to begin doing just this.In the medium-to-long term, yes, the pressure to optimize AI/ML hardware/software stacks is going to become immense, precisely because the demand to utilize these systems is skyrocketing, and will only continue to skyrocket going forward. Just look at Nature, whether physics, biology or whatever -- demand for compute is absolutely unlimited. Where compute used to be locked up in the temple of pocket-protector-wielding uber-nerds who speak and dream in binary, compute is becoming accessible to less and less specialized people, even businesspeople.# AI an artificial intelligence machine will need more computation powwr if not it would  only produce the  same output for the same input at all times as regards to it bin referred to as an intelligent machine. AI has to be improved over time continously, for new updates.#I think that yes, down the line some AI computation will be optimized to use less computation and it will also probably be based on some sort of shared models.MindAIs overview reminds me of the OpenCog atomspace hypergraph.I think that it's hard to envision a really general purpose AI that only has concepts without them being built from the ground up including something like sensorimotor input.  The grounding seems necessary for true understanding of abstract concepts.One thing that seems tough is that the real world is fairly complex and data intensive so at some point there may be a limit to how much you can simplify your processing and still accurately react to the environment.  One could imagine that perhaps higher level reasoning might take less computation.  But again to be accurate there seems a need for some type of grounding, e.g. an abstract geometrical reasoning process might be very efficient in one way but involve a bit more computation for visualization to confirm.But I think that yes there are many optimizations coming down the line, in terms of perhaps not-yet-invented data and parallel compute structures, common models, hardware optimization, specialization, etc.#I suspect the next breakthrough will come from neuromorphic chips.Check out SPAUN at Waterloo. Neuron dynamics, integration, inhibition, and leaks all may have rich semantic encoding properties.Numenta meets SPAUN on a neuromorphic chip. SPAUN already has a library going for Intel's new chip. Semantic encoding and structure recall need major improvement. This is probably key to transfer learning, strong semantics with easily determined relationships. GANs are simulating our suggest and criticize half and half brainstructure already. I think strong critics mixed with the strong semantic and determining will form the next step. Although, Ilya's speech at NVIDIA indicated that openAI taught a honey bee (sim) brain to win at Dota using RL over a mellenia. Apparently, you can teach a been to play vids if you have 1000 years to do it, so brute Computation will continue to yield staggering results.On the brute side, I think that cross training of sufficiently large and sparsly weighted NN may be capable of strong transfer learning.Both paths really come down to brain electrogeometry simulation on full scale. I think we are heading towards biomimicry no matter what.#It will be interesting to see if the AI industry will be open to follow the path established by the work of miners in distrubuted networks in postioning the computational workload not on super computers but on incentivizing the masses to contribute to a protocol on a network. From an economic standpoint its already been proven to be quite an effective alternative strategy, its just a question of which projects are willing to take that risk and be able effiectly implement a protocol that can harvest the insight and contributions of a distrubuted group rather than really on in-house supercomputers. #For some reason I am now picturing a steam-powered robot furiously driving a giant train of horses from the cab of a porsche. But this is a good question. More of the same rarely brings about the next big breakthrough. #Don't really know of the cost of AI could be reduced to become more affordable in the future. For the Data needs always need updates don't know what kind of network could bring about a definite solution for A I #Abstraction can be boiled down to nlogn time, possibly more.  But it atm is an unsolved problem.#Aren't people afraid of AI?With AI,  - Why do I think it will require less manpower? This is because people with limited knowledge have to be laid off because all the super computers will be eating up their jobs. I am really sure they won't be creating as many jobs as internet did.People with not so niche skills will be on road searching for job.&#x200B &#x200B #But you don't need to take chances or come up with scary new ideas in order to strap more horses to the wagon!  It's a nice simple arms race that every CEO and investor can understand.The ""AI"" in the news today are essentially complex statistics.  They have their place, and scale well with computational power, but they're not intelligence and they will hit a wall sooner or later.Just as food for thought, the brain can do around 200 sequential operations per second.  Take a moment to think about that, and how in order to get anything done in realtime, it has to compensate by essentially doing every different computation it can, in parallel, and then discard almost all of it continually.  An optimized architecture with more sequential speed could be trillions of times more efficient than what evolution came up with, simply by virtue of being able to think about what to think.#So far, how many tools do we have that are dramatically more energy efficient than the human equivalent, and are those gains in pure mechanical leverage? For example, do cars run more efficiently than humans (distance per kJ)? I ask because I'm wondering what our expectation should be. The human brain consumes a ton of energy, and that's without turning on the juice. #Wallah, I really like the article and I am reading it thru all the comments now.  This is just to begin with I guess. I hope I get in notification for new articles too. #John McCarthy (one of the founders of AI), decades ago, said that one day ""the simplest computer"" will be able to play grandmaster-level chess using ""cleverer algorithms"". He still hasn't been proven wrong (but we've probably stopped searching).#A future that could one day be as tied to the state of artificial intelligence as it is to the state of the crypto markets today.#Similarly in fields such as planning and search, reasoning and theorem proving, contributions from both A.I. and complexity researchers have been of major importance. There are, however, many examples of A.I. specialisms which are only beginning to attract serious attention from theoreticians. This workshop should provide not only a platform through which participants can report on recent developments within fields where Complexity Theory and A.I. already interact, but also heighten awareness of A.I. disciplines in which a foundation for such interaction can be constructed. Its main focus will concern a select number of topics where interaction between complexity theory and artificial intelligence has been particularly fruitful. Among these are: search, planning & scheduling problems, knowledge representation and reasoning  theorem proving techniques, multi-agent interactions and agent systems, Argumentation and Dialogue Games  phase-transition phenomena.#comparing humans to machine intelligence aside, the fact is that we are taking a highly invasive approach to machine learning which is not 100% necessary.Right now most of the corporations are using massive amounts of data and pattern matching algorithms to extract ""tags"" or categorize data based on thousands or millions of examples.  This is an approach that works most of the time, but the downside is the computing power necessary for training.  Another major con to this method is the limited number of patterns that can be recognized while everything else is treated as garbage or noise.  The overall example of this being imagenet, using millions of examples tagged by humans.  Outside of object recognition in images and video, other systems like the ones that facebook and google use are also based on the same idea: train on big data, find interesting patterns, exploit those patterns on the other side.  It all comes down to statistics using these methods.But perhaps there is another way.  For instance, take the case of object tracking in a video.  To track an object, the system must first take a frame of video and then scan it for known objects.  After finding the location of each object, it goes to the next frame and finds the location again.  Given that prior training was given, the system is pretty efficient.  To recognize a face, a current ML system needs at least 100,000 training examples which takes a lot of time to gather and process.  Even then, why are there no self driving cars in India?  Because there is no way to categorize the chaos that is an Indian street.  Even some reports say that rickshaws (which are as common almost as pedestrians) are so customized that a self-driving car cannot recognize them.The way I see it, there are way too many new types of possible patterns and objects to recognize in any data set that is using real-world data.  If there are an infinite amount of possibilities, it means that there is no upper-limit as to how much processing will be needed in order to successfully categorize everything.Ever since I was a kid, I hated tags.  It seems everyone has to dumb someone else or something else down into a category so that their brain can stop working on trying to figure things out.  Why can't you see another human as simply who they are?  Why must you label them as whatever you label them as?  Even then, many different cultures have many labels which have many different meanings. So with the ""categorization"" approach, MI pundits are trying to put everything into a standardized category which is not realistic.All I'm saying really is that with properly formed AI, you won't need a cloud to process your data for you and return an answer.  Current smartphones and computers could run the algorithm with little CPU power and generate more impressive results. #On my part, the big advantage if we adopt AI will allow people to do new and interesting things that have never been done before. That’s the fun part, so don't look it bad in our human race.#We know that computers are themselves simply machines that implement functions. And so, according to functionalism, mental states are like the software states of a computer. In theory, then, it is possible that a machine running the right kind of computer program could have mental states, it could literally have a mind. It could have beliefs, hopes and pains. And, if it could have a mind, then it could also be intelligent and that is Artificial Intelligence.#Oh... I read comments and articles on AI. What comes to my mind is the future of AI. I read about a subset of AI called Machine Learning is also taking AI to the next level. Machine Learning provides systems or machines the ability to learn and improve without being explicitly programmed. In other words, the capability of machines to learn for themselves including the ability to analyze extensive volumes of data to identify patterns and predict outcomes without the need for human intervention. And the question that came to my mind was what if the machine malfunction? What if the outcome(s) were totally wrong? I don't know if I'm thinking loud or may be I don't know much about AI#Familiar with a prediction use case where the customer had 14 sensors per asset and after ML analysis, what they wanted to predict could be done with 4 sensors. Savings of $25K/asset in instrumentation. #Interesting. Surely such an AI would have some limitations, what you are saying seems like sweeping lemon juice out of a rock..  But again to your point, I might be thinking of it more like the horsemen in the 1900s. This is a new concept, I would be curious to see how much success it has and the drawbacks as well. Overall, a good read. I'm open to learning. #People call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us.#Computing power has increased dramatically over the last couple decades, while its relative cost has dropped. Likewise, data storage. This puts the compute and storage resources necessary for AI within the grasp of even small businesses. AI technologies make it possible to analyze enormous data sets much faster and more accurately than humans.#How likely is it that Artificial Intelligence  will become smarter than humans and eventually take over and control humanity.#> and your take on the other types of data structures that might be out there, like the ‘canonicals’ mentioned in this article. Does AI need to be able to reason abstractly? This is clearly an AGI question.   You should realize that the author of the principle college textbook on AI  (Peter Norvig) has said in public *""I don't want to build a human, I already have two.""*   Norvig was referring to his children.The speedy-reasoning approach can be seen in the work on ""Atom Spaces"" in openCOG   https://wiki.opencog.org/w/OpenCogPrime:AtomNotation  See also  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_logic_networkAnother example would be the Godel Machine of Schmidhuber, which contains a theorem solver which can overwrite itself.  http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/goedelmachine.html #Humans do take much less data than ML algorithms to learn specific tasks, but the difference between humans and computers is that humans come with a built-in prior which you're constantly improving over the course of your life, whereas machines without a huge amount of data would be learning tabula rasa.About point #3, adversarial examples do affect the human brain. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08195.pdf#[deleted]#[deleted]#Agreed! because of this fact that the intelligent system that can somehow mimic the operation of the biological neuron, which is the key to any intelligent biological bodies. The attempt to mimic the operational behavior of a biological neuron in intelligent beings like human ultimately leads to modern-day artificial intelligence. Now it is a cutting edge field for research and seems to be the future of technology according to many experts including Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates & Elon Mask etc. Today, almost all big shot in IT industry are moving towards AI one way or another. But this is not a recent thing.#Is your concern that you wouldnt be able to track the steps the AI engine uses to get an output?#I tend to agree, it would require the machine to learn how to prioritize and then discard all info thats not important. E.g. search 1000 dog pics to indetify a dog and while that is done discard all the old info.#I believe AI should be assistant to humans not a replacement for humans#Yes, it's addressing two in the same questions that are unique in of themselves. But I see an intersection of the two where we try to understand and devise what ""less computational power"" looks like and how it will play out. I can see a need for ""canonicals"" or some other user-inputted data to build an AI such that it reaches a 'minimum intelligence quotient' such that it has a base layer in which to logically and deductively reason. Once it reaches that tipping point, the AI can kinda ""go figure out the world"" and that is where I see the true intersection of these unique challenges.#Hey, Cryptoman227, just a quick heads-up:  **completly** is actually spelled **completely**. You can remember it by **ends with -ely**.  Have a nice day!^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.#Agreed that AI has been improving and it has to be improved upon more. Artificial Intelligence is in very much demand and all the big companies are using it for many purposes. It is just kind of scary that AI might took over the whole world pretty soon. Good luck to the human race. #I so agree with you but what if you invest the same effort with human, you won't be inputting same effort every know. No doubt the efficiency will flicker but it is worth it.Who will buy AI if everything is replaced by AI, leave some space for humans too#>But again to be accurate there seems a need for some type of grounding, e.g. an abstract geometrical reasoning process might be very efficient in one way but involve a bit more computation for visualization to confirm.But I think that yes there are many optimizations coming down the line, in terms of perhaps not-yet-invented data and parallel compute structures, common models, hardware optimization, specialization, etc.Man, I cannot agree with your overall thought process more. I see this as two-fold. We will begin to see a ""slimming"" or ""streamlining"" of data such that extensive computational power will not be needed as previously assumed, yet we will still need a certain quotient of computational power to maintain an ever-growing ""base layer"" of knowledge and assumptions. As that is built out, I see that the need for extensive, hard computational power will increase at an exponentially slower rate to that of the general reasoning or organic ""cognitive architectures"" where the base layer (once reached a tipping point or critical mass) will be able to utilize itself to learn and create deductive and logical decisions and understandings. From there, it can try such hyphotheses against a norm or data set to prove its reasoning valid or invalid. Once that process takes place and is able to learn from the previous hypothesis such that it can improve the next time, scaling global AGI  IS OVER!#Thats an interesting point, but it still doesnt really solve the problem of computation or data storage. It just spreads this across more entities instead of just one big super computer.#I can visualize that too, humans will fight for their existence.#Cost Burden, along with the job loss.Chip Makers, AI makers will be eventually killing people when don't have source of earning.As per me, don't take me wrong this is the tip of iceberg of problems to come up #I couldn't understand what problem with Human in unsolved?#Your view got me thinking about various arguments and views on whether AI is a blessing or a threat to humanity.  Artificial Intelligence is one of the most intriguing topics today. For me, for me it's more of a blessing than a threat. From it effeciency, less man power, timely etc... You are right that in as much it will be eating up jobs, it charges people with little skills to improve on them so as not to be behind. AI brings improvement in human race#>it has to compensate by essentially doing every different computation it can, in parallel, and then discard almost all of it continually.  An optimized architecture with more sequential speed could be trillions of times more efficient than what evolution came up with, simply by virtue of being able to think about what to think.This is exactly where I see the future value in ""intuitive reasoning"" or to ""reason abstractly"" has insane value. Instead of flipping through catalogues and identifying matching data and, the ability to reason give the machine the ""capacity to think about what to think."" It maximizes efficiency and latency on orders of magnitudes.   Check out this article on the Third Wave of AI from Peter Voss. There is tons of evidence that the current AI architecture isn't ""that smart"" nor that sustainable. He discusses what he believes will be the third wave, much similar to the article linked from the OP, but in greater detail. Voss calls it ""Cognitive Architectures"" and breaks it down pretty thoroughly. This is what I believe is the logical next step towards a real, effective AGI.

Part of the answer to that may lie in epigenetics, which forms a second inheritable source of information#You can't talk about ""frequency"" of a human brain the same way we talk about clock cycles on a CPU. All parts of our brain work independently and simultaneously. The closest comparison you can make is through the frequency of spikes in spiking neurons, but the moment a spike is triggered and starts propagating, the neuron that just spiked is free to send out another spike before the previous one has finished propagating. So a better comparison would be the maximum spiking frequency of a single neuron times the number of spiking neurons in the brain.

A child does not need to know the name of a species, to be able to recognize it, nor does it need to know the name of a particular member of the species to distinguish an individual animal from the rest of the species.

Only a small percent of neurons in a cortical area can have high activity at any point, and only a fraction of areas with sparse activity can be active at any one point and even 200Hz in this fraction is prohibitive in terms of energy costs.There isnt any high bandwith neurons sending signals at any reasonable distance that are nonspiking in cortex, afaik.Spiking is an adaptation of larger brains needed for the longer distance signals must travel.Nonspiking is mostly seen in insects where short distance permit analog signal transmission.

Of course division-by-constant or by a power of two are common, but then there is no division instruction involved. No reasonable algorithm that I can think of right now uses tons of integer division, not even if it seems at first as though it would. For example typical finite-field algorithms have a ton of `(x OP y) mod z` in them, but that would be realized as Barrett reductions or Montgomery multiplication or Shoup butterflies etc, with maybe some one-off divides to precompute scale factors. Or typical multimedia messing-about with pixels/audio, that will all be fixed-point scaling (multiply-high and so on) (and in SIMD anyway where integer division does not even exist at all) - eg quantization seems to have division in it but [realistic encoders](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg/blob/master/simd/jquanti-sse2.asm) use some variation of multiply-high (here `pmulhuw`).The last time I saw a full-on integer divide being used to a serious extent it was a bug, where the author made the assumption that the compiler would notice that the divisor was a power of two but that didn't pan out.#> that you should floor((double)x/y)What, you never implemented your own division on 6502 like the rest of us?  )#X86 assembly: https://hjlebbink.github.io/x86doc/This is not usually written by hand.

Same for implementing integer division with the floating point unit: even double only has 53 bits of mantissa so you can even do a 64 -> 32 multiplication, not to mention a full 128 -> 64 bit one. If you want an approximation though, it could work. I also disagree that truncating division is not useful. In fact, I have repeatedly found it the natural way I'd like it to work, across a variety of scnarios: how many whole multiples of something fits in another thing. The other useful semantic I have run across would be some kind of rounding behavior. I agree though that you often want a floating point result from integer division, and that is available too.

Intel got lazy and went for profits over performance increases. The instruction set has nothing to do with why Intel's performance hasn't increased much since Sandy Bridge. And that's a fact.#""Yea but amd is cheaper!!111one""Every single following argument.#[removed]#I agree - it's silly to attack Intel for being ""lazy"" while they do have the highest IPC, clocks, and the lowest latency core interconnections (via their ringbus). This is just with mainstream chips, and of course the server/enterprise market is also heavily dominated by Intel.My biggest gripe with Intel is not their architecture. It is that they increased (twofold!) core count on their mainstream chips without compromising on their per-core performance. This remains to be proven with the 9900K, but still indicates that Intel had been purposely selling weaker processors than what they had available. I get it, business is business. Not long ago, an eight core processor (5960X/6900K) was $1000 USD. When you look at eight core CPU prices today, including the cost of a Ryzen 7, you can easily see that Intel is not doing the consumer any extra favours than what its business requires.#x86_64 is AMD's invention so you can enjoy your 32-bit software on 32-bit architecture. [They also got over 11000 patens](https://companyprofiles.justia.com/company/amd). Making economical and affordable CPUs with good performance is also a breakthrough. Intel had nothing to deliver for this market. If a CPU is a 8c/16t, it must be premium. There was nothing in between, e.g. a more economical 8c/16t and eat AMD's launch. Never before an average consumer can actually purchase a 8-core CPU at $300. AMD is not lazy. Their Zen architecture is made from scratch, learning from their Bulldozer failure. They followed their own way of making CPU, not Intel. Ryzen is still on its second generation with plenty of room for improvement, unlike the peaked out 9th generation CPUs from Intel. To add more cores, Intel will actually have to follow a ""glue together"" design, a design that they once trolled.First generation Ryzen is like a beta product that needs improvements. The 2nd Ryzen is primary a bug fix version with slight performance improvements. The next big thing would happen on 7nm, when they optimize further along with die shrink, and fix the memory latency problem with an dedicated memory controller chip surrounded by the CPU cores. AMD is not lazy, If they were lazy, there would be no Ryzen and no more AMD.#New CPUs are in the pipe for years, so far the responses we have seen from intel have just been rushing the existing pipeline to market (how many generations now have we seen since Ryzen first hit the market?)I know they had previously been hemorrhaging engineering talent as we had a few on my old team (talking 20+ year employees), but now that they see losing the lead they are aggressively trying to rehire old talent that the bean counters let go.#I agree that division isn't particularly common, less common that multiplication for sure, just as multiplication is less common than addition, and so on. I know that a lot of division is by a compile time value. I know how strength reduction to shift operations work. You are perhaps arguing that ""division operators at the source level often don't end up as division instructions at the aemmebly level"". I agree! Perhaps you are arguing that integer division is slow and is to be avoided if possible. I agree, it's slow as hell so that's exactly why you see power of two hash tables even through that might otherwise not be ideal. I'm only disagreeing that division is an anti-pattern. It is not. In the cases you need it, you need it, and it's nice it is getting faster. It's only an anti-pattern if you use it unnecessarily. #Bucket counts are typically not known at compile time (most hash tables are sized at runtime and grow when occupancy reaches some threshold), and pow2 is a generally poor choice of hash table size in any case, as it limits entropy to the lower bits of the key which can degrade perf to linear search (although this can be mitigated with a 'bit mix' step).Hash table implementations jump through many hoops to avoid mod/div at runtime (even though logically that's what is required) such as using a switch with compile-time prime divisors, but these are both advanced and domain-specific techniques.Also not only is going via FP incorrect in the general case (and consider also rounding modes, -ve inputs, div by zero etc.), it's also not necessarily faster given the FP units may be otherwise occupied with their own work.That things like [libdivide](https://libdivide.com/) exists shows that runtime division is sometimes needed and perf critical (image processing is another domain for instance).Overall a faster idiv seems like a very good thing IMHO, let's not complain :).#Well in my case, that's ""all the time"" since some uses of division (e.g., arithmetic encoding and decoding) divide more or less arbitrary integers (spread evenly through the range), so in that case 99.9% of my divisions fall into that range!In general, I don't know how common to use numbers greater than 2^53 (or 2^24 if you want to use single-precision values), but I suspect it isn't all that common. Certainly you can't suggest FP division is an ""obvious"" or drop-in optimization without bringing up the point that it doesn't work for the full range.Overall, I'm quite suspect of this claim even if you ignore the range issue. There are actually certain algorithms bottle-necked by integer division (arithmetic de/encoding as mentioned is one of them), and despite being tuned to within an inch of their life I've never seen an implementation which used this floating point trick.Compilers are also full of all sorts of strength reductions, so if ""converting to FP has always faster"" as claimed, why don't they use that for say a 32/32->32 division, where the 53-bit mantissa would be enough?Even more obviously, why don't Intel or AMD, who apparently have a way, on chip, of doing idiv _faster_ in many cases just use that, instead of constantly improving their rather large, complex and hard to validate integer dividers? They must be really stupid not to know you could just ship the value over to the FP unit and do it all much faster!It is true that something like apparently `divpd` takes only 14ish cycles (latency), while `idiv` takes 26ish cycles for a 32-bit division on Skylake so it does seems promising (and when looking at throughput the result is even better for FP as these seem to be heavily pipelined). Why is it rarely done then? I guess all the other costs of converting all the inputs and results back and forth integer to FP, as well as handling the different rounding semantics generally add up and prevent it from paying off. #Thank you for the example/explanation. Obviously I'm not going to be writing a compiler any time soon :)#That's cool. I somehow never learned about that trick in school. How did you calculate the multiplier? I was reading through the Granlund and Montgomery paper (""Division by Invariant Integers using Multiplication"") and using their method in section 4, I was able to get the same result as your code, but using an additional add and shift. I haven't gotten through the entire paper yet (I'm not that good at reading mathematical notation), but is there an optimized technique for calculating the multiplier that yields the one you used?#> facts are the facts. Intel got lazy and went for profits over performance increases.Your opinions however are not facts. Intel makes literally the fast single core processors in existence, and they profit by increasing performance so that people buy newer processors.  The opinion of yours, that Intel can maximize profits by providing slower processors, is factually incorrect, and extremely naive. #Good point. Intel boasted superior process, yet on an inferior process, AMD CPUs can still manage this much is really impressive. #> To add more cores, Intel will actually have to follow a ""glue together"" design, a design that they once trolled.A design they once had to use just as much, Q6600/6700 anyone?https://www.anandtech.com/show/2112#I hope that end in positive improvements because I am tired of 5% increase every year, not worth to drop my 4790k, and I still see games that need single core performance...#[deleted]#[deleted]#Hey, I know this reply is a bit late but check out Ridiculous Fish's blog post on integer division by constants:http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/labor-of-division-episode-i.html#Especially the code blocks are written in a way that I have trouble following, but I think it's supposed to end up in that last ""else"" in figure 4.2 with a pre-shift of zero. Hacker's Delight has, I think, a nice exposition (and also [this tool](http://www.hackersdelight.org/magic.htm)). libdivide seems to use some third option to calculate the constants, different from both HD and ""Division by Invariant Integers using Multiplication"". Though I didn't use any of that this time.#> How did you calculate the multiplier?So I'm not 100% sure on the bitwise compatibility details (like why the shr has to happen), but the core concept is relatively simple.0xAAAAAAAB / 0x100000000 == 0.66666~. So when you multiply (eax * edx), the result is now a 64-bit number (edx::eax). By taking only edx, you've implicitly divided by 0x100000000.The last bit is when to use shr and when you shouldn't. I never fully understood that part of the code, but it has to do with becoming 100% bitwise compatible with the division instructionThe simple multiply by 1/3rd will get you a result similar to division (but not exactly the same).#[deleted]#Yeah, they really let the market stagnate while they had the lead instead relying on palty year over year gains and artificial market segmentation. My 3770k is starting to get a bit long in the tooth now. I'm pretty salty at intel for fusing off the VT-x VT-d on the k vs the nonk though so I can't do any VMs. Next year's 7nm Ryzen is looking real pretty and I expect they won't fuse off useful parts of the CPU or artificially limit PCIe lanes.#I'm in the same boat, 4790k is still king imo, at least till games can catch up with core usage. #Sure, but now you are talking about source to assembly level transformations (i.e., compilation) and when that doesn't work as expected. Maybe that's what you were talking about all along?In that case, I still disagree that the use of the / symbol in source is an anti-pattern, and perhaps even more strongly. Sure, you can get an ""IDIV"" problem, but 99.99% of the lines of code written aren't going to be performance sensitive enough that the difference between 1 cycle and 40 cycles or whatever matters for your / operator. A large majority of code today is already written in languages which are slow enough that something like addition is as slow as IDIV, and everyone is pretty happy with that!Use (integer) / in your code if its operation you are after, in general. It is not more an anti-pattern than using multiplication, or array indexing rather than pointer increments, or any other operation which ""might be slower than idea if translated directly to assembly"" - you expect it (1) not usually to matter and (2) for the compiler to get it right most of the time.In the rare case you know ahead of time that this line will be performance sensitive, sure, do the ""strength reduction"" yourself, or if profiling shows that you have IDIV problems (and lucky this is a really easy one with modern tools since there are even counters like ""% of the time the divider was active"" which pretty much point you to the issue immediately), then sure dig it.But suggesting writing ""what you mean"" in terms of division or any other operator is an anti-pattern and that instead one should prefer some obfuscating pattern at the source level is IMO wrong for the vast majority of code in the vast majority of projects.#I've heard a rumour that the microcode for DIV etc used to use the x87 divider (which needs to handle 64bit significands anyway), which would explain the sharp performance discontinuity between `rdx` being zero or not (but then, there are other explanations). Not necessarily FDIV as a whole (maybe that too, who knows?), but the divider hardware. Just a rumour though.#It is possible, but it seems unlikely. In particular, DIV and IDIV still appear to be microcoded with 30 to 50 uops dispatched to various ALU ports during a single division operation. FP div has their own unit and you see only a single uop and then the unit chugs along and spits out the answer.It is still possible that there is some sharing: perhaps the 30-50 uops used by DIV/IDIV are only doing ""extra"" integer specific work (conversion to/from a common format, remainder, etc), and the FP divider is doing the bulk of the work, but it seems very unlikely: it is just way too many uops. The performance characteristics of the FP div and integer div are very different as well: throughput of 1 per 4 cycles even for parallel FP divs, but integer is much slower. This has been the case for many generations.Also, the performance for SIMD division (divpd etc) is the same as scalar FP division (divsd etc), indicating that there are N copies of the FP divider, or at least N copies of the required hardware, yet integer division requires significantly different hardware, e.g., since it takes a 128-bit input.Still, I wouldn't rule out sharing - there is definitely sharing between SIMD integer multiplication and FMA units for example (pretty much the integer mul happens on the FMA units) - however that behavior is very obvious from the port usage and other characteristics.Finally, Intel has often spoken about integer division improvements, and even spoken about their ""radix 16"" implementation or whatever, always positioning it as a separate thing. This is consistent with the way the FP division and integer division have improved over the generations: the improvements have been decoupled: sometimes one improves a lot and the other not, and vice-versa. If they were using the same underlying division hardware, you'd expect some type of coupling.However, all this just reinforces my point, doesn't it? If there is some magic trick using the FP units to do integer division faster, we can expect Intel and AMD to use to implement integer division under the covers, so we don't need to avoid it or claim it is an anti-pattern.I'll agree that it's a *performance anti-pattern* to use it (at the assembly level or in a higher level language if it ends up emitted a div instruction) when you could have done something else though. Maybe we can agree on that?#> The Core 2 Quad was not a ""glued"" processor in the way AMD ThreadRipper and EPYC are. Prior to the introduction of the integrated memory controller (IMC), all memory accesses went through the front-side bus (FSB), which acted as the coherency filter.The Core 2 Quad achieved uniform memory access time by running the memory controller off chip, which means that all processors have an access time analogous to the slowest (off chip) time on a NUMA system.  While it is true that making everything slow is one way to achieve uniform memory access times, this seems like a distinction without much difference  usually the implications of NUMA are performance related and so making everything slow is not really what people want.  #[deleted]#[deleted]#So by ""actual program code"" you mean ""compiled (or handwritten) assembly"" right?#>The predecessor also used an FSB, and multi-socket FSB platforms for workstation and server were in wide deployment during that time period.Yes I know.> The Core 2 Quad did not ""make everything slow.""I didn't say that it did.  What I said was that you are making a strange distinction, splitting hairs.  Again, the disadvantage of NUMA is that memory access times are inconsistently allocated between fast local and slow remote or off chip, the slow ones are bad.  The Core 2 is not NUMA  but it is not NUMA because all accesses are the slow off chip kind due to the FSB. Is this really a meaningful distinction?  Both have essentially the same drawback (worse memory performance) for essentially the same reason (interconnect delays).  They are not the same implementation (FSB vs IF) of course, but the result is functionally very similar.   "

I love Zabbix, it's used to monitor our monitoring system lol.#I'm guessing this upgrade will break a lot of templates?#Quite a few things to keep in mind before upgrading: [https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/4.0/manual/installation/upgrade\_notes\_400#configuration\_parameters](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/4.0/manual/installation/upgrade_notes_400#configuration_parameters)#For those that want to give it a quick look, check out the zabbix-appliance Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/zabbix/zabbix-appliance/    docker pull zabbix/zabbix-appliance    docker run --name some-zabbix-appliance -p 80:80 -p 10051:10051 -d zabbix/zabbix-appliance#Zabbix needs a better way to quickly put a set of hosts or triggers in ad-hoc maintenance mode - and then remove them just as quickly, or automatically. The existing maintenance periods/windows are not flexible enough, and take too much time to manipulate. Using a never-ending maintenance window is a workaround, but is a very manual process. We recently switched to Zabbix from Icinga, and I was really surprised that a feature like this was missing from an otherwise extremely well polished project. One of the guys on our team just added functionality to our chatbot to handle this for us. I'd love to have a GUI option for application owners/non-engineering staff to put their equipment in maintenance mode without involving us.Has anyone else run into this? Have you found a more clever workaround?https://zabbix.org/wiki/Docs/simplify_ad_hoc_maintenance#My nagios sub expired and I need to upgrade / move the instance of it and doing so is not going to be an easy task...zabbix finally has the UI refresh I had always hoped it would get (havent looked in > 1 year) and has docker images available so it looks like ill be giving this a POC/trial #I haven't used Zabbix in a while (I only need Netdata these days) but I might give it a try.#This is timed well. I spend most of the day yesterday duplicating a lot of our Zabbix infrastructure in AWS using an RDS based db (Aurora). We are currently running 3.2 and I was building everything for 3.4, but I am at a point where it should be easy to go to 4.0.&#x200B I read through the release information and was actually excited about redoing all the work I did yesterday. Just need to set aside the time to actually do it. #> forced execution of a check Finally!#Ooh, this looks nice. Been thinking looking for a new monitoring system lately. How does this compare to something like librenms?#What are the ""Much more"" features? #I may have to see if there's a good way to export my config and restore it into a container.  I don't really care about the history stuff.  And I love the idea of zabbix being in docker.#We're using prtg currently. Can anyone say if this as good/ better? I really hate how prtg locks the data away in proprietary databases...#Awesome news!Any caveats or things to look out for before upgrading?#Weekend, there it goes (but in a nice way)#wait until Friday afternoon at least#Been running 4.0 alpha for some time now but we're just going to keep that between you and me 😅#What a twist! Not sure what system is supposed to be more reliable, Zabbix or the monster you monitor? :)#Only one way to find out! [Upgrade your production instance ASAP](https://i.imgur.com/OFNjcFb.gif)! #Hmm, why?#Good point!#Currently running this on my lab docker host.  I'm trying to find the default password.  Any idea what it is?#Correct! Zabbix 4.0 introduces problem suppression (new term!) caused by maintenance times. What is missing is an ability to suppress problems manually with one or two mouse clicks. It is coming!#Last time I used netdata is was all single server, single dashboard. Is there some centralized management for it now?#I’ve been looking at moving our Zabbix database to Aurora. What’s instance type did you go with? What about your EC2 type for the Server itself?#Zabbix is a full featured monitoring solution that covers almost all areas you may expect from a modern monitoring system: advanced data collection, real-time problem detection including anomalies, prediction, alerting and escalations, and data visualization too. Scales to millions of metrics and able to monitor IT infrastructure from HW and OS to networks and higher level services.  It is extremely flexible, free and open source (no closed source enterprise editions!) backed by optional  commercial support. That is where Zabbix shines.Since I work for Zabbix I am not in a position to compare it to other nice tools, I am afraid of being too biased, take it with a grain of salt. :) #>Ooh, this looks nice. Been thinking looking for a new monitoring system  lately. How does this compare to something like librenms?librenms has a lot of built-in support for several devices, eg Printers, UPS, Server, Switches, etc. Zabbix does not have this, but it has a great community and you can download on [share.zabbix.com](https://share.zabbix.com) (with good and not so good templates). Also librenms has also an automatic way to detect the right Device/MIBS/Template. In zabbix you must do that by hand.But zabbix has some benefits regarding alerts and escalations and its catching up some tools regarding the GUI, its still not perfect but much better nowadays. and librenms has more focus on network devices where zabbix is a multitalent.sorry for my english#From my own previous experimentation (~2000 switches, 3 core routers, a few sample servers):* LibreNMS relies a lot on ""magic""... it recognizes devices on its own, and for the most part you just unleash it on your network and let it find everything.  It relies *heavily* on proper labelling of interfaces inside your switch/router configuration to make associations.* Zabbix requires configuration... sometimes a *lot* of configuration, but it makes heavy use of templates and triggers.  So Zabbix has a fair amount of frontloaded configuration, but once you've done that it's pretty self-maintaining.* Zabbix uses MySQL as a backend, which means you might need a fairly powerful mysqldb server.  I either configured it badly or didn't have anywhere near a strong enough mysqldb host box... it actually crashed MySQL on me.* LibreNMS uses RRDs -- nice and compact, but you lose resolution and writing a lot of them can be pretty rough on your I/O.  Also, it can query so much so fast that it actually pegged the CPU in one of our main routers, causing some alarms.In the end I think Zabbix is great if you've got someone to be ""the Zabbix guy"".  LibreNMS is good if you've got nobody to be that person, or no time.#Zabbix is fantastic if you have branch locations where having a persistent VPN back to your monitoring server is untenable.  You install a proxy server inside the remote LAN, and configure an encrypted connection back to the main Zabbix server.  All it takes is one TCP connection outbound so it's very firewall friendly if you're in a NAT crunch.#Right, it supposed to have a link to the [release notes](https://www.zabbix.com/rn/rn4.0.0) that contains full list of functionality. Sorry about that!#It's a little harder to get set up with all the templates for specific equipment, but I found the data to be just as good as what prtg offered (other than s-flow) once you got it all configured. #Read upgrade notes in the documentation, it sums up all important things to be aware of very well. Other than that you need to install new server binaries and UI files, that's it, existing agents will continue to work just fine.#Some templates are rated for specific versions. At least that's what they say in the template store. I suspect agents are more likely to break since the documentation says they should be on the same major version#It's `Admin:zabixx`Found here: https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/4.0/manual/quickstart/loginProbably a god idea to put that into the docker image description, too. #These days my system administration is limited to single servers at home. It does have some centralized management but nothing serious, it's pretty lackluster for that. Email notifications are pretty nice though and it's extremely lightweight so it can be used alongside another solution. #It is still missing about 80% of our hosts, so I don't trust anything yet. I picked a db.t2.medium for testing. I may also consider serverless depending on how the workload looks. I also went with a t2.medium for the server. The server we run v3.2 on is about double the size of a t2.medium, but I figure we are breaking up the workloads so it is a starting point. My plan is to duplicate our current environment, with a new server and proxies running the updated Zabbix version. I want to run the existing setup beside the 4.0 setup for a week or two, so I can test, tweak and adjust without breaking the production system.Believe it or not, the biggest problem I encountered was moving the database. I was hoping to preserve everything (config and historic data) and then upgrade once it is in RDS. What I found was that going from MySQL 5.5 (or 5.7) to RDS is not all that straightforward for a 70G DB. I ended up finding a backup script that dumps only the configuration info, but no data. I scrapped the important info and built two commands for mysqldump. One dumps the schema for all of the tables (though I could probably use the one with the package). The second command dumps just the config data. I piped these to an Aurora instance and then pointed my new Zabbix server at that. You can't do this with Aurora serverless without stepping through a system in VPC because it is not accessible outside of the VPC (no VPN nor direct connect path). #We use it in a few of our enterprise environments and I use it in my home lab. It's pretty sweet and simple to set up.** I don't work for Zabbix **#Thanks for that summary. I experimented with some free solutions in the past, I think Zabbix was one of them, but did not have time to actually learn enough to go through the initial configuration. One weekend I was installing Rancid, to backup the configs from network devices, one thing led to another, and in the end I installed Oxidized  -) I noticed that Oxidized integrated with LibreNMS, and gave it a try as well. To my surprise LibreNMS was much easier to set up and use, I added all my devices, starting with network, later adding servers, and at the end I was just looking for anything that supports SNMP, added all the UPS devices, printers and so on. &#x200B Now I read this topic and was tempted to move to Zabbix, which seems like a more 'pro' solution. I downloaded the appliance, but reading your summary reminded me why I never set it up in the first place  -) I would just spend 3 hours trying again and give up. Maybe in future, but for now I am happy with my LibreNMS, which now has almost 2 years of data in it  -)#Well, except native agents released in 2007 and earlier, i.e. Zabbix 1.4.x. We decided to drop support of the old communication protocol finally.#First, we do provide backward compatibility with all agents since Zabbix 1.6. Therefore, you may just upgrade server binaries to any major version and the agents will be absolutely fine, they continue to collect metric data.If you use older templates you will be fine as well, however obviously you won't take advantages of the new metrics introduced in the fresh agents. Note that you may import older templates of any version into Zabbix and you will be fine, Zabbix will perform all necessary conversions (if needed) on behalf of you.#Yep - Admin/zabbix. I had to search for it, too. #>docker run --name some-zabbix-appliance -p 80:80 -p 10051:10051 -d zabbix/zabbix-appliance  Thanks!#Thanks for the info. I was gonna go with t2.mediums as well. As for backing up the database you can use the xtrabackup utility to backup your MySQL database while it’s running and then upload it to S3 and then in RDS you can specify import from S3 backup. Then you’ll be set. All you lose is the time you start the backup to the time it’s running in RDS#Quick question- Was this deprecation only due to protocol support, or is it something that regularly happens with new releases? I'd like to keep them on the same version, but it's tough with 100+ agents being monitored.#Is that new to this version?  Because a lot of the 2.0 templates didn't work in the 3.x builds.  #Yes, the deprecation is only due to dropping of the older protocol that had serious limitations. We never broke agent compatibility before."

Why?#>These instructions accelerate the calculation of SHA-1 and SHA-256.Ah CPU mining bitcoin becomes viable again!#I wonder how much the IPC would have improved if it weren't for the hardware mitigations against exploits.#> A Big Data™ analysis Ummm... what?&#x200B #Interesting. Didn't Intel also said Cannon Lake will finally fix spectre and meltdown? #I don't think it's an anti-pattern in general, but if you're writing high performance code, you shouldn't have any divisions (integer or float) in hot loops on assembly level.I said on assembly level, because some divisions in C are fine. For example, dividing an unsigned integer by 2 will compile to a shift instruction.#So did you learn long division? Well that's what computer's do. So you need to spend at least 1 cycle per value bit (possibly more). Floating point division is even slower (when you deal with subnormals it can take >1,000 cycles), but common every day values only take ~10-20. ---Generally speaking compilers rarely emit true integer division. Say you want to divide by `10,000`. The compiler will instead output a string of bit-shifts, additions, and subtractions that will yield the equivalent result in much shorter time.In fact a large number of computers before ~1980 didn't even come with integer division instructions. #Because integer division is slow on virtually all platforms. Even this ""improved"" integer division is like 18x slower than a multiplication. As such, it makes more sense to multiply by 1/number rather than actually perform a division.Not that the reciprocal is always possible, but you really should avoid division as much as possible. Compilers will convert things to bit-shifts or even subtractions if you got a constant for example.#0% extra because this hardware doesn't have any mitigations against those exploits.#Do we know what the hardware mitigations do to mitigate spectre and meltdown? Seems like a hardware mitigation at least wouldn't hurt as much as the ucode update, but I also don't kniw what rhe hardware mitigation did exactly.#I think the TM is just a joke, kind of like using quotes. In this case the ""Big Data"" is just analysis techniques that handle [large amounts of data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data). It's a vague term.#according to the sticky in r/Intel it's actually not fixed in cannonlake but coffee lake refresh has hardware fixes . #That's an implementation detail, doesn't explain why it's anti-pattern. Most of the patterns (at least the original GoF Patterns) would probably have shit performance too, because it relies on high level language features, but they focus on reusable code for common problem - not performance code.#multiply by 1/n would not work too well for **integer math** as a substitute for a divide as 1/n would be an integer of 0 or -1, 1 in edge cases.The occurrence of integer division is very low in regular code, so it is not something to lose sleep over or drastically change your coding style for.  If you have to use it, then use it wisely.There are a lot of inefficient coding that programmer should be concerned with these days.  They like to think of their time is more valuable than the users.  :P#Oh, I thought 10 nm came with mitigations baked in.Kinda disappointing, although maybe that means we'll see a slight boost when the hardware mitigations are included instead of the software ones.#>doesn't explain why it's anti-pattern. Anti-pattern just means, ""*pattern to be avoided*"" it is a common term in computer programmer where composing together certain abstractions is unwise, but common enough that a lot of people do it.>Most of the patterns (at least the original GoF Patterns) would probably have shit performance tooIDK what you are talking about?I'm talking about patterns of assembly emitted by the compiler. Not like MOSfet layout patterns like (_I think_) you are?What does this have to do with GLOBALFOUNDRIES? >because it relies on high level language features, C is technically a high level language but a lot of people take issue with this. So sure. Even in C on `-02` or `-03` you'll get a string of binary operations not normally just a blind `div` instruction. The assembly emitted by a compiler rarely has to do with if a language is high or low level. I'm not sure what you are talking about? Things like the LLVM all they do is emit instructions and you build different language front ends for likes like Swift, C, C++, Rust, Objective-C but they'll emit similar assembly patterns in specific scenarios. >but they focus on reusable code for common problem - not performance code.What?Division was hard to implement into chips, so nobody did for years. Compiler authors got really good at optimizing it, and working around it (because nobody bother implementing it in hardware), so when chips started releasing division instructions they were slow, but compilers so rarely used them that nobody cared. There was no market demand for fast division (outside of floating point math, where there were other work arounds).Intel optimizing division is optimizing an instruction that is rarely used for historical reasons so while cool it's faster its not like computers do a lot of division any-ways for historical reasons.  ---Play around with integer division on the compiler explorer you'll see its rarely emitted as a `div` instruction [linky](https://c.godbolt.org/z/NBG7Iw)#> multiply by 1/n would not work too well for integer math as a substitute for a divide as 1/n would be an integer of 0 or -1, 1 in edge cases.You'd be surprised!Lets say you are trying to divide X / 59 (59 is a prime number btw, the worst-case scenario with regards to bitshifts and subtracts), where ""X"" is a 32-bit number. At first glance, it doesn't seem possible to convert this into a multiplication problem.But consider the following: (X * 72796056) >> 32, that is, bitshift-right by 32. Remember that imul on x86 is a 32-bit to 64-bit multiplication, so the >> 32 will work out just fine.Lets try some numbers.* X == 58: 0* X == 59: 1* X == 800: 13As you can see, this sequence does a good job at dividing into 59 correctly. Unfortunately, no compiler will do this for you because this operation isn't **exactly** equal to division. But in many cases, this can replace division for most purposes (ie: hash tables or Random-number generators).Many properties of division can be replicated by this ""multiply by the inverse"" process.------------In short: 72796056 functions as the integer multiplicative-inverse of 59. No divisions necessary, at least in any constant factor where the integer-multiplicative inverse is sufficient.#Ndoe has nothing to do with mitigations. Icelake likely does but Cannon lake was actually designed before Cascade lake, whiskey lake, and Coffee lake R which have some hardware nitigations#This thread is a (kinda funny in my opinion) example of the divide that exists between software and hardware guys. In the software world, ""code pattern"" and ""anti-pattern"" have well defined, domain specific meanings, but these definitions aren't shared with the hardware world (since they are much less relevant there), thus causing this situation here, where you're both right and both wrong, by virtue of not using definitions from the same dictionary.Somewhat relevant, the same thing happens in the cooking world and the biology world, which both use the word ""fruit"", but have completely different definitions of it, although they do overlap in many (but not all) cases. That's how you get people debating whether a tomato is a fruit (which is correct from a biological standpoint, but not so much from a culinary point of view). Another example, did you know that bananas are berries?Anyway, sorry about the fruit salad, this topic had been sitting in the back of my mind for a while.#GoF Patterns https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns>It has been influential to the field of software engineering and is regarded as an important source for object-oriented design theory and practice. More than 500,000 copies have been sold in English and in 13 other languages. The authors are often referred to as the Gang of Four (GoF).  Most of my quotes can be found on that page, such as design pattern focus on reusablity and not performance.Also the original quote are specifically ""code anti-pattern"" so please keep it limited within that domain.#Doesn't this just raise the question as to why they were using such a slow internal method for division?The only reason I can see is if the substitution used by compilers isn't guaranteed to be functionally identical under all inputs, but then that raises questions as to why compilers are doing it without prompting.#but your example is no long a simple multiply by 1/n.  It is a multiply by n/m where m happens to be a multiple of 2^n and you are taking advantage of shifts.  It is hard to predict the execution time as CPU might still be able to execute some other part of your code with out of order execution.I do a lot of n/m as a way of removing floating point math on embedded microcontrollers even when m is not 2^n.EDIT:You also have to watch out of overflow if you multiply by a large number (where as there isn't for a divide), so there is an upper limit on the range.#>Most of my quotes can be found on that page, such as design pattern focus on reusablity and not performance.I still don't understand what you are posting about.Did you click this link? https://c.godbolt.org/z/NBG7IwProgrammers write `/`, the compiler doesn't emitting the `div` instruction. That is why nobody optimizes the `div` instruction. #see the first comment I made in this tree:>So did you learn long division? Well that's what computer's do. So you need to spend at least 1 cycle per value bit (possibly more).  There isn't a faster method of division that mathematics has yet discovered. There is Newton-(something that starts with R) but it isn't much faster then long binary division. >The only reason I can see is if the substitution used by compilers isn't guaranteed to be functionally identical under all inputs, but then that raises questions as to why compilers are doing it without prompting.This is why standardization is a *big deal* in the compiler world. The standard tells you what `x + y` will do. Then compiler authors need to figure out which instructions to emit on every platform they support to do what the standard says. So the programmer just needs to understand the specification, and the compiler can worry about hardware details (this is how C/C++ work). #He's converting the int to a long, so it will never overflow#> but your example is no long a simple multiply by 1/n. It is a multiply by n/m where m happens to be a multiple of 2n and you are taking advantage of shifts.I agree. Its not quite the same, but it works out the same in **most** situations (Ex: Hash-maps, Trees, and so forth). There are very few cases in my experience where you need the bit-precise division operator.> You also have to watch out of overflow if you multiply by a large number (where as there isn't for a divide), so there is an upper limit on the range.Literally not a problem on x86. x86 multiply instructions return 128-bit values rdx:rax (when using 64-bit operands), or 64-bits edx:eax (when using 32-bit operands).I guess its a problem when you are coding in C, but you can write an intrinsic / inline assembly that performs this multiply and returns rdx (top 64-bit result) instead of rax. So its not a big deal. No matter what, the ""mul"" or ""imul"" instruction blows-out the rdx register, so the ""bitshift"" is [literally free on the x86 platform](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/IMUL.html).#The original quote said division is [code anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern), a term originally coined from the Design Pattern book - colonially called the GoF Pattern.  Yes, you mentioned the division is slower than most other operations in the CPU, but as far as code is concerned, it's an implementation detail. Furthermore, the [GoF Pattern book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) contains a lot of pattern that doesn't focus on performance. The entire list of [Creational patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns#Creational) is probably the most common example of Enterprise™ Coding™. You can see why I view ""it has poor performance"" is not a reasonable justify for ""division is a code anti-pattern"".#Is that not contradictory though?If the compiler can beat a div instruction through software then why wouldn't Intel/AMD just release processors with microcode to implement the exact same behind the scenes?#>You can see why I view ""it has poor performance"" is not a reasonable justify for ""division is a code anti-pattern"".Because you are stupid.Assembly is code no less then C/C++. So the term ""code-anti-pattern"" applies to it like anything else. It is a anti-pattern in assembly for divisions instructions to be included.#We're talking about CPUs and performance here, not high level software design.  Your notion of 'anti-patterns' relates to stuff like code reuse, testable functions, object design etc, concerns that exist in the field of high level software engineering.  The 'anti-pattern' used here refers to implementations to be avoided for performance reasons, such as avoiding division when possible, cache friendly memory accesses etc.The same term can have multiple meanings based on context.#https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-patternDivision in  high performance code *is* an anti-pattern: it's a pattern and it's harmful#For integer division, the instructions get passed exact operand values. To do this at the processor level, every call to IDIV would need to break down into more instructions to figure out the method of converting the operation into a series of right shift and subtracts for a value unknown to the processor until it decodes the instruction. Once it figures that out, THEN it executes the actual divide.  The programmer knows what the value they want to divide by is, and that value is known from the high level language down to it's compiled binary. The processor doesn't know anything about the code until it actually loads the instruction to run it.#Wow, agressive much?#In that  case please outline all the steps you can do to avoid it.#Sure ? The main pattern to solve it is to compute the inverse of the divisor outside of the hot path / loop and multiply by it. Some compilers are able to perform this optimisation on their own though, e.g. GCC with -O3 -ffast-math."
AskAcademia;9my86e;1539167026.0;/r/AskAcademia/comments/9my86e/phd_student_im_supervising_wants_to_change/;PhD student I'm supervising wants to change project - any advice?;[deleted];"I think your annoyance and exasperation is understandable, but it has no place in the academic/lab settingYou voluntarily gave your time to answer her questions, but this was done with no strings attached  she is not forced to continue working with you and you shouldn't be angry about it. She is free to change subjects, with the respective cost of doing so (writing new proposal, starting over, working with someone not so helpful, etc). Plans are constantly shifting and people should adapt to it.From a practical standpoint,  don't try to pressure her, as then she might do a half-assed job at your project, and it could be even worse, as you will have to be over her ass for things to get done. Similarly, don't be hostile towards her (telling her that ""she should just work on another project""), building a hostile environment in a lab is a terrible thing to do, and will make a disservice to your own mental health. Have a sincere and friendly conversation on what she would like to do, and from then onwards decide a polite course of action.In academia we are constantly doing things that are ""rewardless"", we review papers anonymously , we take PhD students that might fail for random reasons (or go to industry, gasp!), we help colleagues with their questions, we answer anonymous questions in reddit, etc. At the end, you have to decide what are you willing to do, and accept the losses of doing so.Take this as a lesson, next time try to waste less time with your students, for instance teach them find answers by themselves or limit the questioning time (hey, I have just 30 minutes, what would you like to ask?).And be kind to her, remember she is just starting and she doesn't really knows what are the implications of what she is doing, how it affects you, how your time is going to be wasted, etc. She just wants to be happy and follow a fulfilling research path that is in accordance with her interests.#I agree she should talk with other members in the lab about their work.  But also the struggles they had getting their project to the point they are at.  Molly may have been going along with what the PI told her would be her project and didn't really think about what she wanted to do.  But since she's having so many troubles with cell culture, which is pretty basic thing in a wet lab, she could be feeling she can't do the project and is bailing before it gets even worse.Now if she really wants to change her project, I would ask her want she wants to work.  The project question and basic design.  Similar to a PhD proposal but without all the experiments laid out.  Anytime I wanted to start a new project, my PI always made us come to him with the question laid out and a lit review already done.  This made us really know if that project was viable and gave him the info he needs to okay it or not.  But while you do this, you still have to keep working on the original project he gave you.  It's something to think about having Molly do if she wants to change her project.  Just handing her a new project may result in her bailing again when things get difficult.  I know you put a ton of time into training her and it would suck if she changed projects and left you with this one.  It may mean putting this back on the burner until other student comes that can help.  Depending on the project, it may make sense to have her work with other labmate who then gets all her questions.#>If she changes project entirely, then I am so upset at the amount of time I ""wasted"" with Molly - not only just training her in the practical aspects, but also time spent answering the huge pile of questions.That's a sunk cost fallacy. It's only been a few months. But if she continues, she'll be around for several years. Or worse, she'll drop the project cold turkey after another semester. Maybe you'll get a better suited and more interested student for this project and then training them won't take that much effort either and they'll produce better results. Let her go. If she wants to continue in your group, make it clear that this is an irreversible decision and she can't switch projects another time. If she doesn't like whatever other project you come up with, she has to go to another lab. #I've often seen this with new students: after a few months, they're frustrated because ""their research doesn't work"". They're used to success, because experiments designed for teaching labs do work, and generally you can apply some ""recipe"" to get a good grade, and they have trouble handling what they see as failure when things become a little more difficult.  That's especially true for more ""bookish"" students, who receive good grades because of their theoretical knowledge but fail to adapt when more practical things are required, which seems to be Molly's case in your description. I'd try and tell her this, that it's normal that not everything works in the beginning, and that it's not failure, it's research. I always tell students at some point in their Ph. D. that if they didn't struggle with the research, then it wouldn't  be research. Nobody needs anyone to work on questions that solve themselves on the first try, they're often not scientifically relevant. Now Molly seems to be quite immature and to be expecting a dream job where everything will always be perfect. If it were me, I'd tell her that there's no such thing as a dream project, as she seems to believe. In every project in every field of work there are boring moments, frustration and sometimes disappointment. But you need to overcome that of you want any kind of career. She's lucky enough to have a good project cut for her by you, many students would envy her. She'll likely be sorely disappointed if she thinks she'll do better with a project of her own. And then what will she do? Run away again at the first difficulty? (If she does that then her leaving is a blessing in disguise for you). You could also stress the fact that it puts you and the rest of the staff in a difficult position.  Those are the points I would try to convey if I were you. Of course I come off as harsh and if I had to tell someone this I would do it way more gently, but you get the idea.  #I am willing to bet she will get bored of a new project as well. When I was in my PhD I was also easily distracted from the hard slog of following through on projects by The allure of shiny new ideas. Until my advisor told me firmly no new projects until you have finished your old ones. And now I see the same thing in my students: Wanting to start new projects when the first project isn’t even near completed. And I feel comfortable insisting they follow through on what they started. If they do not enjoy the hard slog of completing research, it is better that they realize that sooner than later.#Time to get the PI involved? #Does the student have some low hanging fruit side project while she works up these cells? I find these difficult times much easier when I have a couple side projects I can move along. #>Molly joined and started her work in August.It's really been 2 months. Sure, there was time invested before, but in the grand scheme of things when you act like there's a huge sunk cost here, on the time scale of a 5-6 year degree, it's not that much. Sure it's a big inconvenience to you, but it's her *entire life* for the next 6 years. Nobody should have to be in a place they're miserable for more than half a decade. You should certainly try to encourage her and understand if there's something deeper that you just don't know about. Find out what about the practical work or literature she doesn't enjoy. Try to find if she has something in mind and understand why that appeals to her more than what she's working on (possibly there's rose-colored glasses toward something else and you might be able to dispell misconceptions). But don't trap her in something she hates and don't resent her for trying to be happy.#I would suggest applying encouragement. It could be that she feels uncertain about the difficulties in the lab, and is looking for reassurance.#I'm out of academia now and I would like to bring in a slightly different perspective. Essentially, in almost any job in the US there's freedom for the employee and the employer to end the contract. So anywhere you work, there's always a chance the employee will leave at an inconvenient time. Don't take it personally.Your student has her reasons for leaving, and she has wasted some of your time, but she's also wasted her own time, so you have to accept her decision to move on from something that isn't working. It probably wasn't easy... it might be a mistake, but it's not your call to make.You shouldn't take it personally but it's fine to be angry and frustrated. I had someone who took over a postdoc project I worked on who applied to a job at my current company. She had the interviews, we flew her out and put her up to meet everyone, we talked to our lawyer about immigration... in the end she said she couldn't take the job because it was in a different country. No shit... it was always in a different country... that was the job you applied for, interviewed for, etc, etc... that would never have changed. I'm still upset with her... she never even contacted me to apologize or explain anything.And I just got word that someone who told us for three months that she was negotiating her resignation (taking a long time because she owned stock in the company) had changed her mind. That messes up a lot for many people in our office. What can I do, though?Any way, it's a common thing. Don't take it personally. Hopefully you'll find someone new who will be interested.#Some of the other comments make me think of the Imposter Syndrome.&#x200B Would it be rude to bring that up? Not as an accusation but as a way to let her know that many people in academia experience it - if that is indeed a part of what is going on here.#There's two separate things here to address. One is your exasperation/frustration with this student, which has likely been building for a while, and two is the student switching projects.It sounds like this student was genuinely leaning too heavily on you as a resource, and this is probably a good lesson to you on teaching someone how to find answers instead of giving answers right off. Really work through why you're frustrated. Lots of things in science feel like you're pouring your energy into something that always wants more, and you've likely worked through that feeling in the past with a project that required lots of late nights and still went nowhere. Why is this one getting to you?Second is her switching. Right now you're sick of dealing with her and wouldn't mind her leaving, I get that, but that would do both of you a disservice. If I were you I would sit her down and try to work out exactly why she's finding this project unrewarding. If she worked through a lot of literature, she probably found it interesting at one point. How can you encourage her to rediscover what she liked about the project? Is she just discouraged by the lack of progress or has she been going along with what everyone wanted from her this whole time? It might not be bad for her to have more than one project to work on, so that when something is failing on one she can still feel like she's making progress. Is there any way you can encourage her to split her time instead of dropping it entirely? Could she help with one of your collaborations as well as the project she was initially on?Finally, consider trying to encourage her to start seeing a mental health professional now, rather than later. Grad school is stressful, and finding no joy in a project you used to find interesting enough to make it the core of your thesis is potentially an indicator of depression.#Doesn't this student have a thesis advisory committee?  At my institution, Grad students have to present their research plan in the first-year(ish) quals and then show the progress on that plan in every advisory committee meeting.The PI and the advisory committee discuss and approve plans to deviate - this often happens (as when an avenue of investigation looked promising but turned out not to be).Tell her to talk to the PI first - it is his/her decision, not yours (unless you are officially a Lab Manager).#I agree and disagree. Answering questions is fine. Being kind and understanding is fine. But she made a commitment and put herself in the critical path. People were depending on her professionally. #Your first paragraph is one of the first things I tell students when they're embarking on active research for the first time. It is so incredibly important for them to know that the research life has a lot of set-backs and that's OK.#Yeah unless you have a PI that keeps telling you to work on a project that doesn’t go anywhere. Took 1.5 years to get her to ok dropping the project. Good thing I had a couple of side projects that turned into something. #But I get the impression that the issue OP is expressing here is related to the wasted time (s)he dedicated to this student. If (s)he wouldn't have dedicated for this student, then (s)he wouldn't be this annoyed.   In any case your point is valid, but what to do? To push her to follow up in her commitment?  I think this is a terrible incentive for research.  Disclaimer, I come from mathematics, therefore I have no lab experience, probably the issue is worse than I see it.  #> People were depending on her professionally.Nobody is legitamately depending on a grad student who has just started in a field 2 months ago professionally for anything significant.#>Took 1.5 years to get her to ok dropping the project. Good thing I had a couple of side projects that turned into something.HAHA same thing happened to me but the side project got scooped. I'm mastering out b/c I'm done with the poor management bullshit that seems standard with academia.#I'm not sure what you'd do honestly. Its unfortunate. Pushing the student to be miserable on a project they don't want to work on is no good, but it's hard to know if this is an issue with the project or with the student. Will the next project they move onto be dropped by the student in a similar manner? #Hey there, thanks very much for your comment. Yes, I do agree with you that she owes me nothing, and that I shouldn't really make my annoyance that obvious to her. At the same time, training her in doing this particular line of work does take a lot of time and effort, not to mention the reagents you have to use to make it all possible. &#x200B I didn't mention this in my post (perhaps I should have - it's added in now!), but Molly did spend a year doing 3 month rotation projects in various labs, including ours. She had full knowledge of the various projects that are happening in the lab, in addition to experiencing the possible difficulties and limitations of what we do. I think if it was someone recruited to do a PhD and didn't have the option of doing rotation projects, I would be much more understanding if they felt like this project was not very compelling for them. From my viewpoint, Molly had all the tools to make a decision - she knew the people, the projects and an idea of the scope of techniques she'd be using.&#x200B And thanks a lot for your advice - I tend to get quite attached to students and want to help them out if I can. Other students I've supervised have been more independent  I should put better boundaries in the future if I recognise that the student needs this much attention."

I saw it a few weeks ago when it aired and don't remember it mentioning facebook that much.#I'll add one which gives reasons to dump FB:A [TED talk with UNC professor Zeynep Tufekci](https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_we_re_building_a_dystopia_just_to_make_people_click_on_ads) entitled, ""We're building a dystopia just to make people click on ads.""The professor deals with more than FB, but her noting that your data from FB can be used to diagnose/predict mental illness even before a doctor could should be an eye-opener.#These videos are great and everything, but most people have heard all this before. Those who are still on Facebook know all about how exploitative it is with their data  they either simply don't care, or they have no alternative.What we need is **not** more videos telling us how bad Facebook is... we need to be presented with workable alternatives which do actually respect your privacy. And not just open-source software which even computer-competent people find tricky to install, but actual high quality, easy-to-use software which your grandma could use.It's easy for some people to hark on about how they should use Thunderbird instead of Gmail, DuckDuckGo instead of Google, OpenStreetMap instead of Google Maps, LineageOS instead of Android, Linux instead of Windows, etc. etc. etc. but the fact is, all of these products almost certainly offer an inferior user experience for the ""typical"" user.Until we address *that* problem, mega-giants will still exist.#I am glad I never got a Facebook account.#> what is the relevance of the John Oliver sexual harassment episode?A small clip present on that episode [John Oliver - Last Week Tonight - New Facebook ad campaign ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq--0iwdB54)#That one was already on the list!#There are workable alternatives. The problem is your family and friends don't use them, so who'd you have to talk to? And even if you do convince them, how would you convince the family and friends of your family and friends? Without them, they'd have no reason to leave the safe comforts of Facebook to an alternative. It's a much bigger issue than software. #> but most people have heard all this beforeMost people only read the headlines. They have heard about the problem but they don't grasp/understand the magnitude of the problem.#Might wanna be careful with duckduckgo, it's based in the US and Gabriel Weinberg launched the Names Database.#Oh yeah! Nice one.#My bad. :(But that video's good enough that it should be mentioned twice. :)#> The problem is your family and friends don't use them, so who'd you have to talk to?There is a reason why the first video is about Network Effects. You don't need to convince them. Just delete your presence on Facebook. That way, you are ""forcing"" them to leave and adopt a solution that respect not only your privacy but also the privacy of people that want to communicate with you. So my suggestion for you is to watch and understand the first video - the power of network effects, and then delete you presence on Facebook surveillance systems. For that check [this tutorial](https://np.reddit.com/r/AntiFacebook/wiki/guide)#What do you suggest?#All videos mentioned are really good. This is the best collection. #One person doesn't force anyone to leave. You need multiple people - which comes to the exact same problem of popularity. Too many people use Facebook, are well adjusted to Facebook, and are addicted to facebook. It ultimately is not a software issue, it's a social one. #Startpage.com#Personally I still use it mixed in with bing (Ha). I've heard of startpage but haven't looked into them.#> One person doesn't force anyone to leave.You have to see this as a cascade effect. You leave, other people found that need to use another way to stay in sync with you. With time this encourage other people to leave creating a snow ball effect.#The monopoly is too huge for any one person to have an effect. Any meaningful snowball effect would still at first take a large amount of initial leavers which brings us back to the fundamental problem of creating a Facebook alternative: getting people to use it. #Do your own contribution. The change starts on you. Remember Leo Tolstoy    ""Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.” #I don't use facebook. I mostly don't use google. I don't use chrome. Nor do I use windows except for very extraordinary circumstances. "
learnprogramming;9p5kcn;1539833493.0;/r/learnprogramming/comments/9p5kcn/how_ive_learned_how_to_shortcut_learning_an/;How I've learned how to shortcut learning an additional programming language;"Hi guys. Over the past 12 years of programming professional I've distilled a lot of my experience into logical steps to learn a new language quickly and thoroughly. I hope you get something useful out of this. If you have any questions let me know below.Here are 5 ways you get shortcut your learning process.* Use knowledge that you know from other languages* Nail down the fundamental knowledge* Resources that will help you learn fast* Find what you don't understand and work backwards* Try first, then ask# Use knowledge that you know from other languagesThe fastest way to learn a new language is to already know at least one. Use what you know from a previous language to learn a new one. For that I use, [http://hyperpolyglot.org/](http://hyperpolyglot.org/).What I love about hyperpolyglot is the table format comparing multiple languages. It's easy to see relationships between what you already know and how you'd implement them in the new language. Want to see how you'd do variable interpolation in Node.js, but you only know Python? No problem. Have a look at the reference sheet under ""variable interpolation"".Sometimes what you know in one language doesn't translate 1 to 1 to the new language. That's okay. Just learn the differences. For instance, in PHP you have class property visibility, such as ""private"", but in Python there isn't an exact translation. Private class properties in Python are denoted by an underscore or double underscore (which mangles the instance variables name). The manipulation of them are more left to convention. If a Python developer sees an underscore, they know that by convention they should avoid manipulating it directly, but nothing really stops them from doing so.**Added 10/18/18** Although transliterating one language to another is definitely an easy and fast route, each language has their own idioms which will force you to think in new ways. Idioms will also make it easy for other developers to quickly understand the code you wrote. That being said, if you learn something in one language there’s nothing wrong with implementing some flavor of it in the new language if it’s still concise and clearly understandable. For instance, JavaScript wasn’t intended to be a functional programming language, but it has language constructs such as functions as first class citizens that allows for it. Someone thought they’d try programming in the functional paradigm in JavaScript. It turned out just fine. This isn’t always true, but do what’s best for the project.We could go one step further and learn the differences between the languages. For instance, learning channels in Go for concurrency is pretty unique to the actual language, but the general concept of concurrency and shared nothing is pretty universal.## Nail down the fundamental knowledgeI think a lot of learning problems come from jumping into the deep end too early. They rush into coding, say for instance, from a tutorial without truly understanding the fundamentals.*Do not* skimp on the fundamentals. Yes, it can be a bit difficult to understand. Yes, it's not as fun as going straight into coding, but it will **shortcut** and **accelerate** your learning. It will, **reduce** your frustrations. When something doesn't work, you'll start to realize and **understand why**. Now please don't take it as me saying don't learn by coding. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying don't jump into coding while winging the fundamentals. Don't jump into learning Rails while ignoring learning Ruby. Don't jump into Vue.js without learning Javascript. Don't jump into Postgres without learning data modeling and indexes. Don't jump into writing an HTTP API without learning HTTP, TCP/IP, Caching, RPC, and REST.Understand variable scope before you use them, understand closures and its relationship to variable scope before you use them, understand generators before you write your own, understand promises and its association to asynchronous programming. If you skip these fundamentals in a language that has them, you'll see yourself often confused.## Resources that will help you learn fastThese resources will help you learn the basics of a language quickly:* [http://hyperpolyglot.org/](http://hyperpolyglot.org/) * [https://learnxinyminutes.com/](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)# Awesome EverythingA few years ago someone started curated links around certain languages and frameworks and posting them as repos on Github. I'm not sure who it was, but I am grateful to that person. If you've ever seen the icon on the left, you've undoubtedly experienced an Awesome List. There's pretty much a curated list for everything: CSS, React, Go, design patterns, scaling, big data, machine learning, and the list goes on. If you want to learn say Python, just go to Google and type in ""awesome python"". Try it now with whatever you're trying to learn: ""awesome \[PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE\]"". Sometimes there will be multi repos with awesome lists on the same topic, but perhaps with separate links. Pick and choose resources from those lists that help you learn fundamentals about that language.## Find what you don't understand and work backwardsHaving a particular difficulty? First, realize what you don't understand and that scope of it. Work backwards by diving deep into the fundamental concepts around the problem that you're having. For instance, if you are writing an anonymous function in a loop, you're trying to use a variable that's in the same scope in the anonymous function, but you see that it only ever uses the last value, learn what closures are and how they work. You'll learn that the anonymous function is actually a closure (not in all languages) and apart from having access to variables inside of the closure it also captures a reference to the variables outside of the closure. Learn more about closures in Javascript. Read as much as you need to to fully understand the problem you're going through.I find that reading as much code that I can, mostly open source repos on Github in the target language I want to learn, uncovers pretty much most things you need to know about the language. Find what you don't understand and work backwards as described above.## Try first, then askWhen trying to learn a programming language and anything else such as a framework or a paradigm, it is my opinion that you should try to make an effort to learn on your own first. There are plenty of resources available that you could search on Google that there's no excuse in this age of information, to not at least be able to find information first, read it, and try yourself.Now after trying on your own to learn you get stuck and not able to find information online that helps you get unstuck or you need fundamental knowledge that isn't anywhere, then go ahead and ask experienced people questions. This shows that you've done your homework and that you value their time. There are many places to find these experts: Slack communities in your particular region or ones around a particular topic, the trusty IRC channels, Reddit, forums, Gitter, and sometimes even Twitter.Keeping all of the above points will help supercharge your learning, not only in your beginning stages of learning an additional language, but throughout your career.If you liked this article, please share it with those that you think would benefit from it.As I've mentioned, if you have any questions around the learning process of learning a new language please let me know below.";\+1 for mentioning hyperpolyglot.

In ‘Dataclysm’, Christian Rudder, founder of one of the world’s biggest dating websites OkCupid, puts this flood of information to an entirely different use: understanding human nature.>Drawing on terabytes of data from Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, OkCupid, and many other sites, Rudder examines the terrain of human experience to answer a range of questions: Does it matter where you went to school? How racist are we? How do political views alter relationships? Philosophers, psychologists, gene hunters and neuroscientists have tried to explain our flaws and foibles. Rudder shows that in today's era of social media, a powerful new approach is possible, one that reveals how we actually behave when we think no one's looking.>Outrageous and illuminating, ‘Dataclysm’, is a portrait of our essential selves – dark, absurd, occasionally noble – and a first look at a revolution in the makingThe first discussion thread for it will be on Monday the 5th November. Based on the discussion from last weeks thread and the response to the books selected so far, we will be returning to fiction for December.Lastly, you may also use this thread for any other feedback you have about the club, ideas you have etc.;Suggestion: We add a work of fiction in as an option.#I'm on record as saying that you should ignore suggestions and just do whatever you want.  You had the great idea in the first place, you should run with it.But here's my suggestion anyway (feel free to ignore)  Why not 2 options each month?  Fiction and Non Fiction?  There's not a TON of conversation about the books each post, I don't think it would be that confusing to have people discussing one of two potential options in the thread.  With an online book club, people are either interested in the book or they aren't.  If they aren't they aren't going to bite the bullet and read it anyway, they just aren't going to participate.  2 books, one Fiction and one Non-fiction.  I would expect this to encourage more participation in general, as opposed to a half/half situation where people who like one side will ignore the thread for the month when their side isn't up.#My only thoughts on the matter is it's good to see a non fiction representation, a bit of expanded thinking never hurt.#I have never read a nonfiction book for pleasure. I am going to order this in the morning from my local book store.#Fresh Off the Boat: A Memoir by Eddie HuangI'm not Asian, but I came from a similar background and admire how he fused his three very different influences into his own.#City of Thieves should be considered for next month!#I think it’s better to wait a month than to divide the relatively small group. #im a fan. even the show is great. #I don't think you're dividing the group.  That implies that everybody who is going to participate will participate regardless of book. I don't think that's happening.  I think what's happening is the audience that happens to be interested in the book will participate.  The rest won't.  This means you aren't dividing a small audience between 2 books.  It means you're offering books to two different audiences.#I love it too, but the thing is the show and the book are vastly different. So much so that Eddie Huang has abandoned it.#So you’re saying adding a book just adds a new group. Perhaps, we can only know from experience. Given how few are interested in a reading group in general, I’m skeptical we’d get two groups that sum to be more than what we currently have. #I think it's a *guarantee* that we'd get more than what we currently have.  The current group is a mix of *  People who would join in regardless of book*  people who are reading because they like the book of the month.You've always got the first, and if you add a second book you'll keep the second while adding another.The question is would either *individual* group be more than what we currently have.But given that the last thread on Storm of Steel had exactly [3 posts discussing the book](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/9mfmrg/the_askmen_book_club_choose_novembers_book_storm/)  I don't think you're at risk of losing a whole lot either.Edit:  I'd argue that the number of upvotes for the book club discussion posts in comparison to the actual participation is a strong indicator that there is a lot of interest without engagement.

You are free to post any thoughts, opinions or questions you have about the book so far. In addition, this week we will vote on what the next book should be. The books to choose from are:""Dataclysm: What Our Online Lives Tell Us About Our Offline Selves"" -Christian Rudder>An irreverent, provocative, and visually fascinating look at what our online lives reveal about who we really are – and how this deluge of data will transform the science of human behaviour.>Big Data is used to spy on us, hire and fire us, and sell us things we don't need. In ‘Dataclysm’, Christian Rudder, founder of one of the world’s biggest dating websites OkCupid, puts this flood of information to an entirely different use: understanding human nature.>Drawing on terabytes of data from Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, OkCupid, and many other sites, Rudder examines the terrain of human experience to answer a range of questions: Does it matter where you went to school? How racist are we? How do political views alter relationships? Philosophers, psychologists, gene hunters and neuroscientists have tried to explain our flaws and foibles. Rudder shows that in today's era of social media, a powerful new approach is possible, one that reveals how we actually behave when we think no one's looking.>Outrageous and illuminating, ‘Dataclysm’, is a portrait of our essential selves – dark, absurd, occasionally noble – and a first look at a revolution in the making""Why Beautiful People Have More Daughters: From Dating, Shopping, and Praying to Going to War and Becoming a Billionaire-- Two Evolutionary Psychologists Explain Why We Do What We Do"" -  Alan Miller and Satoshi Kanazawa >Why are most neurosurgeons male and most kindergarten teachers female? Why aren't there more women on death row? Why do so many male politicians ruin their careers with sex scandals? Why and how do we really fall in love? This engaging book uses the latest research from the field of evolutionary psychology to shed light on why we do the things we do?from life plans to everyday decisions. With a healthy disregard for political correctness, Miller and Kanazawa reexamine the fact that our brains and bodies are hardwired to carry out an evolutionary mission? an inescapable human nature that actually stopped evolving about 10,000 years ago.""Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us"" - Robert D. Hare>Most people are both repelled and intrigued by the images of cold-blooded, conscienceless murderers that increasingly populate our movies, television programs, and newspaper headlines. With their flagrant criminal violation of society's rules, serial killers like Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy are among the most dramatic examples of the psychopath. Individuals with this personality disorder are fully aware of the consequences of their actions and know the difference between right and wrong, yet they are terrifyingly self-centered, remorseless, and unable to care about the feelings of others. Perhaps most frightening, they often seem completely normal to unsuspecting targets - and they do not always ply their trade by killing. Presenting a compelling portrait of these dangerous men and women based on 25 years of distinguished scientific research, Dr Robert D. Hare vividly describes a world of con artists, hustlers, rapists, and other predators who charm, lie, and manipulate their way through life. Are psychopaths mad, or simply bad? How can they be recognized? And how can we protect ourselves? This book provides solid information and surprising insights for anyone seeking to understand this devastating condition.You may vote [here](https://linkto.run/p/8DH0RU72).";"Ech, who chose those books. Can we get something with fiction? Most of these choices are just studies put inside of a book and expanded on #City of Thieves should be considered at some point- Written by a man- Masculinity is a big theme in the story- Main characters are male- Cyka blyat#Seriously who choses those books.  I looked up the second one and I don't like what I read about at all, it seems pretty faulty in it's science.#Storm of Steel is one of the better war memoirs I’ve read, and it stands out to me particularly among WW1 memoirs in not being poetically antiwar like Goodbye to All That or All Quiet on the Western Front, but Infantry Attacks by Rommel is a little better paced and more engaging. If anyone wants to experience something similar to those two, also check out Over There by Henry Evans, an American artillery officer. Also on my list are The Burning of the World by Hungarian infantry officer Bela Zomboric and a book sitting on my shelf aptly called Poilu which is an autobiographical account by a French infantryman.#Oh, hey. I read Junger's *Storm of Steel* about 6 years ago, and I picked it up again at a charity shop. See, I always liked it, but fuck me sideways, Junger was a maniac. It makes an incredible contrast to Erich Maria Remarque's *All Quiet on the Western Front*, which depicts the trench warfare in all its' bloody misery. The big difference is, Junger served as a stormtrooper on the frontline, while Remarque didn't. *Storm of Steel* is autobiographical!You bloody well wouldn't think that! Junger seems to revel in his accomplishments, describing injury, loss, and torment with equal detachment. I've heard some people call him a 'born soldier', but he seems to just never record his own emotional reactions. Descriptions of the Somme are factual observations, as are the burying of the dead, and the pain of his injuries.It's a really good book, but it gets boring as fuck at times. Seriously, Junger manages to make an artillery bombardment sound like a shitty day in an underground shelter. His prose gets kinda flat, so after the first few chapters, I usually just weep and set it aside. Wouldn't recommend it as a binging book, but one you use to chill before bed or on the toilet.It's one of those weird books that is authentically real, yet bucks expectations. I don't recall a single passage where Junger moralises or waxes lyrical about how terrible war is. His opinion seems to be 'I was there, this was what it was like, I had a job to do, I did it'.Anyway, not an easy to read book, but definitely interesting.#These selections sound like interesting reads as far as my own personal taste goes, but I feel that they will have a hard time being picked up by a decent majority of the regulars here. I agree that perhaps there should be a fiction/non-fiction/wildcard kind of choice.&#x200B EDIT: lol at the near 3 way split#I don't know about these books but I'd highly recommend Unbroken. Outstanding book and personally made me think about how I face challenges in life. #I would like to recommend you replacing one of your choices with *Lonesome Dove*.  Thank you for your cooperation.  #Yeah... I love the idea of an askmen book club, but so far the choices have been lacking IMO, which I think is reflected in the actual participation.  This post has been up for 7 hours and there are exactly 0 posts discussing Storm of Steel.  When the AM mods first brought up this idea there were a ton of suggestions of *serious* books and subjects like this... honestly I think just to show off.  People who had already read these books and were excited to let others know that they read these books because they're *so very clever*#>. The big difference is, Junger served as a stormtrooper on the frontline, while Remarque didn't.Lol which propaganda website did you read this off. Erich Maria Remarque was at the Westfront, not long because he got injured from granadesplinters and a shotwound at the neck shortly after deploying there. The Pro-war people in Germany accused him of not serving, but he was drafted in 1916 and was at the Westfront if only about two months.#[deleted]#And what kind of engagement did you get with those serious books in comparison to Bond (itself a very old and troublesome read)?I'm not blaming you man. I saw all the suggestions/complaints you got.  I am just saying that I think you are trying to cater to a vocal minority and perhaps are overcorrecting anyway. A suggestion: fuck the suggestions. Forget the ones made by people when you brought Bond to the table. Forget mine now. You had a really cool idea. Do the books you think are cool / would be cool to talk about and let the chips fall where they may. If these kinds of articles are really what you want to do this with then fuck everything I've said and roll with it. If you want to do Bond after Bond  then go with that.  Just don't try to cater to any particular group or you'll never be right. #Can we try doing *Lonesome Dove*? That's one people usually really like.#How about categories like 3 fiction: 1 crime/thriller, 1 epic, 1 classic and 3 non-fiction: 1 biography, 1 about philosophy, 1 about psychology. #How about suggesting ""An Enquiry On Human Understanding"" by David Humes?#I opened this thread to recommend this.  I'm halfway through reading and it's pretty great."

Lisk;9p6fwe;1539841579.0;/r/Lisk/comments/9p6fwe/liskecosystem_is_supporting_gny_project/;LiskEcosystem is supporting GNY project;Hi guys,&#x200B as  [u/John\_Muck](https://www.reddit.com/user/John_Muck) announced yesterday on reddit, [**LiskEcosystem**](https://twitter.com/LiskEcosystem) is supporting [**GNY HQ**](https://www.gny.io/) by signalling the intention to forge on the network.There are many reasons behind the decision. First of all, GNY already has experience in the field of machine learning, which is not a common thing these days, especially for ICOs. Most of the time, people have very less experience in the field they are starting to have their ICO, so this is a big plus. Also GNY team have developed a working product in the past, so the prerequisites are there, I would say.Speaking on a technological level, I really think that there is an immense potential for many fields by combining machine learning with blockchain and big data. Besides this, a big pain point in the blockchain industry is having a reliable cross chain protocol. Today there are two options at least for Bitcoin, the 2 way peg or by using lightning network.GNY tackle all these issues and I personally think that blockchain ecosystems in general would benefit from combining them with machine learning. By having a working Lisk Machine Learning within our ecosystem I can only say that we will have a big plus to offer for the projects interested to build on Lisk.As I'm personally quite interested into blockchain and machine learning technology, I decided to support GNY project and that is also the time for me to go to the next level.A more detailed view over the potential of combining blockchain with machine learning/AI and big data will come in as a blog post on medium. I will share it here, when is done.&#x200B Also don't forget to follow [**LiskEcosystem**](https://twitter.com/LiskEcosystem) on twitter and visit [http://liskecosystem.io/](http://liskecosystem.io/) from time to time to check the latest state of Lisk ICOs and tools.&#x200B Best!&#x200B &#x200B ;A little confused here... I see no issues with GNY proposing to forge on the Lisk network (becoming a standby delegate with the intention of getting enough votes to be a single slot within the 101 active delegates). A sidechain group actively forging on the mainchain, would actually be a good move and would ultimately benefit Lisk entirely. Is LiskEcosystem proposing to become a forging node on a GNY sidechain? If not, then why/how would LiskEcosystem 'support' GNY? - Perhaps I need to read the u/john_muck post to understand it better...#I will try to clarify things a bit if there is any confusion:* by running a node on gny network I will assure the security and proper functionality of the network. - for me this belongs to support * As I said above, I think the combination of machine learning and blockchain will bring us many advantages and I intend to speak about them on reddit and blog posts. - this belongs also to support * I intend also to use the gny platform once is ready for diverse experiments and speak about them if I think it would be interesting for everyone * Running a sidechain on Lisk or GNY by LiskEcosystem is not necessary support but more an use of these platforms. For that two things are necessary - that we can technically really do that and a good business case. I have some ideas for sidechains but for me this will mean to go 100% in this direction and I'm not there yet and the tech itself is not there. &#x200B #Hi [/T3sla369](https://www.reddit.com/user/T3sla369), Yes little confusion there as its mixing up a number of issues. I will let Lisk Ecosystem explain his signalling on GNY and LML we are very pleased to have him step forward. Secondly GNY HQ will never be campaigning or holding a delegate position on the Lisk network itself.  We are here with only our goal of making LML the best product we can and bringing active enterprise groups here to use it and promote Lisk in general.  #Why would GNY never campaign for a Lisk mainchain delegate position?#I don't see Sidechains campaigning to be Lisk delegates as a bad thing at all. I think it could be positive.. Maybe it would be comparative to Apple software programs like iTunes or Logic Pro X becoming Macintosh Delegates, if Apple where to be a blockchain. If there were 101 amazing side-chains benefiting the world via Lisk, why not double as a delegate to secure the network they operate on?...  Additionally, if these companies are making great money, than they can afford to kick back more to voters..#That is an interesting one, but its quite simple, GNY HQ want to keep any role we are performing as very defined, our goal is around a successful sidechain, users of our network will want to make sure our focus remains on that pursuit. #Yes, agreed.#But Lisk would benefit from appearing even more professional. One of the major criticisms about Lisk, is that there are too many undeserving and colluding forgers (Lisk delegates) not doing enough for the network, the investors or the speculators. Simply providing a node, just doesn't 'cut it' anymore.
slatestarcodex;9k42q3;1538287306.0;/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9k42q3/showerthought_before_big_data_much_of_psychology/;Showerthought: before big data much of psychology was investigated by intelligent introspective people surrounded by intelligent introspective people. I wonder how that biased early research.;[deleted];"The acronym WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic) was coined in reference to the bias believed to have been introduced into psychology by the heavy reliance on convenience samples of nearby college students used in psychological experiments.#It's likely it influenced Freud and co, because their approach to psychology was very philosophical without much concern for falsifiability. However, there was a psychologist who was around at the same time (potentially a bit before, but I'd have to check that) who were running experiments using the scientific method with basic statistical analysis.  So I think it depends on the school of thought.#The psychologist Carl Jung was greatly influenced by his trips to Africa. He writes about his experiences and his conclusions in Modern Man In Search of a Soul, and came to some interesting conclusions, attempting to dispel a lot of misconceptions at the time that whites were very different than blacks. He comments on the superstitions of the Africans, which whites would find ridiculous, but then speculated that, provided with experiences that are out of the ordinary or unexplainable to us, an educated European would very quickly become just as superstitious.https://www.amazon.com/dp/0156612062/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_FuqSBb23WEP3N#[deleted]#You're probably referring to Fechner and his first experimental psychology. He called it psychophysics and picked a bunch of low-hanging fruit that continue to be valuable today. Great piece of science history, unfortunately overshadowed by Freud.#Individualism is not popular among Western, Educated, Rich Democrats.#> Great piece of science history, unfortunately overshadowed by Freud.Looming over it forever, like an unloving mother.#[deleted]#Again, I disagree with this simplistic view (I know your opinion is corroborated by Hofstede etc. so it's the underlying framework I'm objecting to and not your interpretation). Swedish people may be individualist in many obvious ways, but they are also united by respect for this individualism, i.e. have a cultural taboo against infringing on someone else's freedoms or conveniences. It's not an individualism of the sort where you move the fence onto the neighbor's land whenever there's no strict demarcation to stop you. At an extreme where everyone shares these values (which is easy, given a homogenous population), this produces a high-trust society that isn't very different from a well-functioning collectivism. Even in, say, architecture, where mutual consideration and good communication produces a harmonious urban landscape just as well as explicit top-down planning.In this sense, Swedish immigration policy is an interesting experiment. I wonder if they'll eventually change their subconscious assumptions about goodwill of other individualists (who do not possess this second part of the formula), or if they'll somehow make their new compatriots similarly considerate, or if they'll instinctively move into smaller enclaves.#I find this argument to be weak and unconvincing. The Left uses ""individualist"" like a slur for selfish, greedy people.#Actual personality traits and ostensible political beliefs expressed in slurs need not be perfectly aligned. Someone may believe oneself to be against racism and routinely advocate for discrimination, for an easy example. Leftist ideology is, broadly, a collectivist one. Does this mean lots of typical collectivism in behavior, i.e. respect for family, community, tradition? Not really. Do they claim to also support individual self-expression? Sure. Interestingly, post-Soviet countries strike me as extremely, terrifyingly individualist, i.e. the formal ""greater collective"" has completely superseded actual emotional collectivism. People don't know their neighbors and oftentimes would gladly hurt them for petty profit or fun  family members run scams on each others (much of that is gone with the 90-s, luckily) or murder for apartment. Pretty atomic if you ask me!The terms need more precision."

The new 2000 series even includes tensor cores. Also you don't need more precision for ML. In fact its the opposite, you can get away with much lower precision than 32 bits. That's why FP16 performance is becoming important now for machine learning tasks.#Wait, that stuff is useful?

The old Enigma story shows what can (and will) be done to break cryptographic algorithms if the motivation is big enough. Back then, it was WWII and the threat of extinction. Today, it's control over the economy and information, which is probably the ultimate power. The governments deployed the brightest mathematicians and best resources to crack the codes. Today and tomorrow, they will deploy super computers, big data, quantum computers and AI together with advanced hacking infrastructure. It's going to take some heroic effort from the Monero project to stay on top of all this.;"This is a good reminder.  We need to reflect on this every once in a while lest we get lost in the buzz of icos, black market shennanigans, fancy new mathematics named after fortnite dances, etfs and wtfs...  This is life and death.  Not just life and death for the individual members of our species who need it to escape oppressive regimes and to enjoy the basic sovereign rights that all humans deserve.  Neigh, in fact this is life and death for our entire species and known sentience in the universe.    Stephen Hawking, rest his memory, is gone.  So is John Nash.  So are countless other geniuses.  Our rarest spawns, they gifted us with a wealth of advanced discoveries in how we (as the universe) understand our own selves.  And if we don't get this cryptocurrency thing down, and transfer humanity onto a standard of value exchange that can't be corrupted by the whims of the short-sighted oligarchs... It will have all been for nothing.  We, and this entire planet will die.  All trace of our advanced discoveries and near singularly will tumble into the abyss and for fucks sake - it took hundreds of millions of years to get our saved game this far.  We may not (speaking as the universe as a whole) get another shot after this.  The conditions for a sentient space-faring species that develops cryptographic monetary standards are apparently so rare that we can't find evidence any other part of this universe has even gotten close.   So don't lose sight of what's important through our journey.  We're in this for the species, boys and girls.  We're in this for the entire sentient cosmos, and you can damn well bet the entire gaze of history and the wishes of all our ancestors are resting on our actions at this very moment.  Make it count. #Pretty neat. I’ve always wondered about an asic for brute forcing the keys to a bitcoin wallet. It would be expensive and it would take a ton of parallel computing power. But with a public blockchain like bitcoin actors know the value of the prize. So I pose the question:  1. Are there any single wallets valuable enough to create and implement an asic for this purpose?    This could be used for nefarious purposes to steal coins but could also be used for recovering wallets which contain large sums of lost coins for one reason or another (lost keys, forgotten passwords, broken hard drives, etc). #Monero - come for the drugs, stay for preserving known sentience in the universe #You’re getting me all teary-eyed, bruh.#*instantly sells back into fiat on next moon shot* sure for humanity #But... but... how are cryptographic monetary systems detrimental to the survival of a species? Zerg, Tyranids, and other hive-mind civilizations don't need money to exist and flourish. Star Trek federation didn't need money to exist and flourish. The civilization that built Rama or Monolith from the 2001 Odyssey most certainly does not require money to operate.Having money is just acknowledging that greed and selfishness still exist in our species, an that we're not ready to ascend to the stars.#[deleted]#Your data set includes a large swathe of fictitious space faring species.

Nuclear fuels, fleets of ships, FTL drives can be manufactured. Genetic material can sequenced, sent as a stream of bytes, then assembled on destination.Without proper information, it takes thousands of years for a civilization to start making Jurrasic parks or antimatter bombs. Because scientific research is usually not encouraged or very insufficiently funded.#Unless there is a war going on...  Then science is highest priority. (Which brings us back to the topic)  The best thing that could probably happen for human progress would be contact with some advanced alien civilization 10 - 30 lightyears away. That would keep us very busy with essential research for a few generations. #Exactly!

They wouldn't need to download blocks, just the hash chain, which is currently about 2MB and very quick to verify (less than a second to verify the whole chain).  If the network becomes very large, like over 100,000 nodes, this is what we'll use to allow common users to do transactions without being full blown nodes.  At that stage, most users should start running client-only software and only the specialist server farms keep running full network nodes, kind of like how the usenet network has consolidated.> SPV is not implemented yet, and won't be implemented until far in the future, but all the current implementation is designed around supporting it.#Regular computer can easily run node in the 100MB blocks.."

msp;9l5p6a;1538603167.0;/r/msp/comments/9l5p6a/are_we_proposing_azure_file_sync_over_fileservers/;Are we proposing azure file sync over fileservers yet? (Little humans big data);Edit: i took out my comments in regards to $$. Edit : The situation is described below but whats curious to me is if anyone has experience with azure file sync and if it would be appropriate for this scenario. Basically using it as a fileserver that downloads only needed data and keeps the rest in the cloud. A cloud based DAS in my opinion. Looking for insight, experience, suggestions, questions, comments and criticism:Situation:I’ve got a client who runs a newspaper with a circulation of ~20,000, with fewer than 15 active users. Due to the nature of their work, they’ve got about 4TB+ of media, are currently working off of a NAS along with a portable hard drive (connected to the owner’s PC) with even more data. These both are backed up with at the file-level to a cloud repo.We’ve recommended placing a server in their office to perform as a domain controller to centrally manage the users, and once we’re doing that- secure remote connectivity to their office with an RDS server and replace their NAS and other unmanaged data with a File Server.Two issues:We’re trying to tackle increasing (rather IMPLEMENTING) network security with this solution.Another major consideration is their data. They’ve got lots of data they use, need, access, share, etc. I’m looking at attaching a DAS to this server- effectively expanding this server to a super-large storage device, run this in a converged system placing the hypervisor on the server and all the VMs on the power vault, and either utilizing storage spaces or simply RAID.Assumptions:Based on our conversations with them, we’ve concluded internally (assumed, really) that this data is active, needed and wanted:• All their data is actively used and impossible to use an HSM tiering solution except for something that is purely automated. (Storage spaces creates a heat map every day and places frequently accessed data on the SSDs) I’m not just looking for tiering but I wish I had ground to assume a retention policy that can keep them (their data) small. I don’t believe that will be possible here.• This data is critical for the business to run. It’s hard for the IT Pro to pinpoint what kind of data will be needed for the next printed issue without input from users that are fully involved with that data. Getting this kind of information will be very difficult and most likely inconsistent and inaccurate since they don’t have policies or the manpower to provide this information.• They want to keep all their data and will refuse to implement a retention policy to delete old and unused data.Assumed Comparable Scenario:Studio/Photography/Marketing. Somewhere where you’ve got large files, lots of them, and not so many people.Cause for hesitation:Are these assumptions reasonable?Should they be specifically defined by client?I’ll add here that they’re not technical and have in the past explicitly let me know that they “don’t know, don’t care and hope that it’s good”. I would only push back and force them to make a decision if the impact of that decision has a financial factor.With so many ABCDEFGaaS flexible, fast and secure solutions available, is it completely OVERKILL to suggest physical corporate-grade hardware that will have to be professionally managed, serviced, and eventually replaced at the end of its lifecycle? The server along with the DAS approaches $20,000 and will require an additional purchase for a backup solution. I’ve been looking at Azure File Sync but on the flip side- why tie my client in to a monthly and expensive solution as opposed to the DAS which might require just setup and minimal maintenance?;"$25k for a server is outrageous for 15 users, why is it so high?   Supermicro or Norco 24 bay 2.3"" drive with SAS expander and nice hardware RAID card set to RAID10 (or 6 if speed isn't much issue).  You can run 22x4TB drives for data and 2x240 or 500GB Flash drives, with everything else should put you well under 10k with server licensing and everything else.  Setup Veeam B&R server with cloud connect repository for a couple hundred a month and you're set.  #Dude, there are plenty of good servers that have 12 or more drive bays.  Add in a good RAID card, and a fast tier (smallish SSD) for VM boot disks and a slow tier (they don't need anything more than SATA or 7.2K SAS disks for this) for storage.  With current disks you can easily do 20TB or more in a single server without dealing with external connections to other devices.#Would like to hop on this thread with my question, per favor.I got a little bit lost with all the options here.\-------------------->What do you think is the best solution then?My customer has 5 sites and about **14TB** in their File server.It feels like staying with an on-premise solution is the best thing.Having a local file server and backup with Windows shadow copy or similar.What do you reckon?Ta!#Tailor maid for Datto NAS. I just implemented a 6tb Datto NAS for a newspaper that sounds uncannily like what you just described. #Have you looked at SharePoint + OneDrive? The new sync client on 1803 with on-demand files is pretty fantastic. That may allow you to take care of the file share needs and shift some of the budget towards the security initiatives.#Quote from Xbyte.. yeah its pretty high but i can share it#Gotcha.. need a server OS anyways (rds,dc etc) so going with the non NAS route.#Currently use that for other clients.. not too excited about it. Been getting too many issues and support tickets.. dupkicate files, not syncing, etc.Do you find Azure files to be somewhat of a more robust solution?#seriously?  they have a 1TB limit and like 100,000 file hard limit. #Let me guess R740 with a powervault SAS enclosure?  4TB enterprise drives are like $200 each and a solid SAS RAID controller that allows SAS expander is under $700. 6-7k for hardware and a couple grand for licensing and you're set.#Sure I get that, but realize how much money you’ll have left over to dedicate to those non-data holding servers. Data backup is handled already. My customer has a DC, RDS, and an application server along with that Datto NAS. Those servers don’t hold any critical data so we just have a local image based copy of the os of each. All 4 devices would put you way under $25kJust my 2 cents. #I just don't see the value. For a client this small, you can do RAID-10 with HDDs and performance will be more than enough for a file server. 6TBs is pretty inexpensive, you can buy 4TB disks for cheap. You don't need a DAS and definitely don't need flash storage.Azure Files puts you in a weird place where you get the worst of both worlds by it being a hybrid setup. You still need a server, but also store files in the cloud. You pay the upfront costs for the server and also ongoing storage costs in the cloud.I'd go all in on a server on-prem or go pure cloud storage (with something like Dropbox for Teams if you don't like OneDrive).#Great details on paper:)#Maybe do some more research, OneDrive allows for 5TB per user with Enterprise licenses and Sharepoint starts with 1TB and can be increased to an unlimited amount.300,000 synced files is where you see performance issues, it's not a hard limit. That's also an insane amount of files to be syncing.#Your description isn't even too far off from the quote..#except the Datto monthly costs will eat them alive.  6TB is how much a month for unlimited restore?#Smart move. Im trying to figure out if the NAS part can be placed in the cloud with Azure. Since its syncs to the FS itll be LIKE its on prem.#Thanks for your thoughts..You're basically saying to load up the server with poor performance drives to bring the cost down.Forget money. Is azure file sync a good idea for a file server? Have you used it?It seems like its made for creating a hybrid environment  for whats been on prem till now but i was thinking of using it the other way. They have a cool caching feature for the data and it just seemed like a pretty good idea. Server for operational stuff and ""cloud daas"" (aka azure) with cloud features to utilize cloud stuff for storage.#over 100k files sharepoint and OneDrive go crazy.  Its not really many files, especially for news organizations that likely have millions of small text or jpg files.    It used to be a hard limit, then they recently decided to upgrade it but theres massive performance issues that cripple the system. We've deployed and had to rollback migration multiple times after MS swore it would work.   #6tb backup with 1 year time base retention - i charge $300/month and do fine. If that’s too much for that amount of file based backup (local and cloud), then they need to go back to paper and pen. #Azure file sync does not replicate changes more then once a day from the files accessed or edited on the cloud side.  Also they do not support windows ACL's yets. If you are only having them work off of the Azure share and just syncing it locally to have a copy that's fine, but if you wanted to give office workers a faster share you find quite a few issues spawn from this in the future. I would wait until they implement journaling, windows ACL's, and allow faster sync's before deploying. #coming from someone who's been debating deploying it to a few of my sites.#Have you run benchmarks on a RAID-10 with HDDs? Your raid controller will provide a cache and the read and writes will be faster than your Gigabit network connection. This is especially true if users are remote. Azure File Sync does what you said you didn't want to do in your original post. It stores the data in Azure and syncs all of it or a subset of the data to your onprem server. It's not going to do what you want it to do.I've used it and thought it was okay but I don't have a good use case for it.#I guess YMMV, that hasn't been my experience with it and I work in Corp currently with a fairly large user base. If you had a bad experience with it, then so be it.Also, that file amount is massive. My entire org barely has over 1million files in SharePoint and we're just shy of 1,000 employees. That's across all departments, so no chance any person would need to sync every file in the entire company. They sync the data they actually use frequently and access older data using the web.#Paper and pen? Like write down all the zeros and ones that make up their business critical data?#Thank you!! Needed to hear this.#True point. I understand performance might be just fine tbh.I said i didn't want to do that? Not sure where i said that, would actually like to know if this is an excellent use case for it!Again, thanks for your thoughts!#Precisely #I was referring to your comment about not using a tiering solution since your assumption is that all of their data is ""hot"" data. If you used Azure File Sync you'd still have to store the 6TB of data on-prem, which is why I made the comment about it being the worst of both worlds for this use case.It seems it's really meant more for multiple sites that need a subset of the data. For example you've got 20TB of data but each site/location just needs a subset of that data. It seems very much like BranchCache except using Azure.#I wonder how long a restore will take.#This is all correct. Let's say it wasn't hot data.Provided azure fs delivers what's needed and wanted as quick as a file server (not many users so probably likely)... What do you think?Also.. were you able to easily set permissions with Azure Files? Read that's it pretty difficult to do.#Yeah I really can't speak to that portion of it. My experience with it was merely in testing/lab environment to play with it. I've never used it in a production environment."
tmobile;9n24dm;1539196251.0;/r/tmobile/comments/9n24dm/tmobile_suffers_too_much_of_a_good_thing/;T-Mobile suffers too much of a good thing;A couple years ago I switched to TMO because the taxes & fees included pricing. And their data speeds actually were pretty good at work. Which sadly is where I spend most of my time. Even though the company I work for have contracts with AT&T and Verizon. AT&T seems to have some sort of repeaters or DAS, as their speeds are nothing spectacular but usable. Verizon must have a full on antenna array as panel antenna can be seen all over the place (It's a big building). And as soon as you walk in you get full bars and over 50 Mbps speeds with Verizon.    But many must of caught onto to the price point and usable speeds of TMO as now they seem to be suffering from congestion during normal work hours, full bars but dismal speeds. And then after hours speeds return to what I was getting when I first joined TMO. Heck, a couple coworkers in my immediate work area recently made the switch to TMO. But either of them are big data hogs.   Oh well, I'll keep on with TMO for a time. But I suspect nothing will be done to improve the congestion in this area. TMO sure have been racking up the customers but at the cost of degraded data services at times. ;"They seem very stingy with DAS deployments and rely way too much on macros.#It ebbs and flows. Technology improves, and people hop on. And one of the side effects may be congestion.I totally know what you're talking about. I think with the sprint merger and deployment of 5G, itcan help with that congestion...until the numbers get too high and there may or may not be issues with congestion. Again. LolWait it out, if you can! It only gets better from here.I feel you, boo. #I must be lucky.T-Mobile has done nothing but improve in Phoenix, AZ over the course of the last three years I've been with T-Mobile. I get and still get three to four times the speeds I used to get on Sprint and I average 18-70 down, depending on location. Coverage is everywhere I go. Hell, my iPhone 5 which is 4G only on T-Mobile gets 10-12 down on 4G.Sorry about your congestion issues. I did 16 years with Sprint so I know your pain.#Just a thought. Why dont you use your office's Wifi while at work? I mean Im not debating about the congestion, but I always wonder why people dont do this. #I'm finding out that more and more of my immediate co-workers have switched to T-Mobile. Making more sense as to why speeds have gone down. #[deleted]#They probably want to wait as much as possible until the merge as B41+DAS is a match made in heaven. #Macros don't penetrate new construction very well. #Everytime I see a micro cell I look at my signal and get disappointed.#Small cells are expensive.  T Mobile is still half of the size of the big 2, therefore they don't have the revenue to pay for small cells like Verizon.  The merger with Sprint should help though.  Also having less customers also means that most macro t mobile sites are less congested then Verizon/ATT ones, although this differs depending on location and T Mobile users do use a lot of data.#Yeah. We're one of the lucky ones. The major cities are treated well.#It's closed for private use. #That sounds like a congestion problem, which is the opposite of what you implied.#Why isn't band 4 good enough? Why must they always wait for the new shiny spectrum?Just get it done! #None of that you just said is really accurate.>Small cells are expensive.  Small cells are way cheaper than Macro sites.>T Mobile is still half of the size of the big 2, therefore they don't have the revenue to pay for small cells like Verizon.  T-Mobile has have the connections, but a significantly higher percentage of postpaid phone customers. Thousands of new small cells are coming online every month.>The merger with Sprint should help though. Long term, yes, access to Sprint spectum should help.> Also having less customers also means that most macro t mobile sites are less congested then Verizon/ATT ones, although this differs depending on location and T Mobile users do use a lot of data.Each carrier has just about the same number of cell sites to customer ratio. As T-Mobile grows, they add more towers. It's more about spectum holdings than towers.#It's because of their spectrum issue. T-Mobile doesn't have enough band 4 spectrum(it's usually 20~30MHz wide) so even if they install a DAS it won't be fast enough. That's why T-Mobile was so interested in LTE-U. #I think you got it backwards. Verizon has a significantly higher percentage of postpaid customers, whereas T-Mobile has just over half their customers on postpaid.#I don't need a DAS at a baseball stadium. Office buildings don't need boatloads of bandwidth, just a usable signal.#I should remove the word postpaid, and just say Phone customers. Verizon and AT&T are years ahead of T-Mobile on ""connected devices"" that take little bandwidth, but they count as a ""connection"".#True, but Verizon still has 111 million postpaid customers with 91% of those being smartphones. That’s still significantly higher than T-Mobiles total customer base including connected devices.#They have 111k ""connections"", not customers.Of their entire ""phone"" customer base, 91% are smartphones, 9% are basic (flip) phones. That does not mean that 91% of 111k connections are smartphones. Verizon doesn't release these details in their earnings reports.Verizon absolutely does have more phone customers than T-Mobile, don't get me wrong here.. but the gap between them is much smaller than overall customer base."

Facebook needs both, one to better target you specific ads (waste less money of advertising companies) and large audiences to target ads to most people possible (bigger catalog). If the user engagement decrease (via people leaving the platform) the value of advertisement campaigns also decreases. This means that advertising will send less money for Facebook to fight for your attention - the real Facebook product. Remember that 98% of revenue of Facebook comes from ads.

cscareerquestions;9o79zq;1539558180.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9o79zq/as_a_veteran_discrimination_against_hiring_vets/;As a Veteran, discrimination against hiring vets needs to END.;[deleted];"[deleted]#Veterans typically get preferential treatment. If you are getting multiple rejections the common factor might just be you and how you present yourself. #Reading this post, it's hard to sympathize with you.First off, as a non-degree'd developer, let me just say that your military experience is not a replacement for a CS degree.Nobody is jealous of you. Sorry man, most of us who went into tech don't give two shits about the military. This is a mostly left-leaning industry where military experience grants you 0 brownie points anywhere that matters.As for your failure to get selected, this will always either be your lack of technical skills/experience or your personality. Judging by your post, I would say probably the latter, but considering your arrogance, I won't rule out the former either.Amazon is a Big N. Believe me, people smarter and more qualified than you have failed with them.Frankly, you sound like an arrogant whiner. I wouldn't want to work with you either.#[deleted]#Military veteran with no degree here. Currently working as a swe at a tech company. From my experience, ive always felt that i got preferential treatment as a veteran. Military experience is not a degree so stop comparing them and no one is jealous of us being veterans. Stop whining and go apply to other companies. #I would say it’s your superior attitude that puts people off. And the paranoia that is so apparent in this post probably does not help either. You think you are better than everyone else because you have served. That may be true, but those who you look down on (and assume malicious intent to) will decide if they want to work with you or not. And if your attitude does not change they will not want to. It’s that simple. You don’t respect them and they can feel it. And if they have to decide between someone friendly and you, guess who they will select. #There is a lot that's unknowable here. I can conduct a mock interview on $VOIP_SERVICE_OF_YOUR_CHOICE and give you feedback, if you'd like? Let me know...#Based solely off this post, you come off as somebody who feels entitled and blames other people for their problems. >Jealous about not having served in their youth, and now regretting that decision. You also demonstrate a poor understanding of other people. Do you really think a bunch of tech nerds wish they were in the Marines? I feel like you convinced yourself that this is true.#people are being unnecessarily hard on you here. But I agree with them that there is no proven equivalence between 4 years enlisted and an engineering degree.They both have their ""not a lot of people can do this"" spotlights. I would probably cry and/or pee my pants if a drill sergeant was screaming in my face, or I had to get up at 04:30 and run 5 miles (or had to deal with an actual crisis, like, you know, enemies shooting at me). A lot of jarheads can't get past basic arithmetic, let alone algebra, calc, or trig. Let alone learn how to code, or write a coherent essay. And of course there are people who have done both, and that is you.Personally, I think more employers *should* treat 4 years' service the same as a degree, simply because both are proof that someone stuck with something challenging and completed it. That's 99% of what a degree does. It distinguishes people who can ""pass the test"". The test isn't perfect, and degrees have a whole fucking slew of things wrong with them, but they serve their purpose. Service, however, has a huge difference in that it's *compensated*, whereas most of us have to *pay* for school and it's goddamn expensive. So bottom line it's the employer's discretion if they want to treat 4 years armed forces as a degree, and I wish they would.As for discrimination, that's a very specific civil law matter. And if you really feel that strongly about it, I suggest you get an anti-discrimination attorney and have him/her monitor your applications and interactions with employers. If *they* see bona fide discrimination, they can leverage very powerful federal laws that will either force them to hire you, or allow you to collect a princely sum as a penalty for overlooking you.#\> So, now, I sometimes notice clearcut discrimination from companies despite all of this experience/skills.&#x200B That could easily be a lot of other things, too.&#x200B \> Strangely enough, a lot of the people whom I experience this from appear to be jealous for whatever reason. Jealous about not having served in their youth, and now regretting that decision.&#x200B Assuming it's jealousy also seem hasty.  Why would people who already have cushy tech jobs be jealous?&#x200B \> I have all of the requirements they're asking for, references & certifications however I constantly receive a ""Not Selected"" status. Why?&#x200B It could be your personality or many other things.  Maybe there's better candidates for the job - a lot of people seem to not realize they are weighted against other candidates, that's it's not an 'all checkboxes checked and you're in' thing.  Maybe you come off as too gung-ho or too much of a drill sergeant.  Who can really say?  It's really easy for other people to read others wrong.  I've gotten soft-balled by people before and it sucks, but I can't honestly say it had to have been discrimination.&#x200B You could find someone who will do an interview and give you honest feedback about everything.#Basically your entire post is a rant without any substance. You bring up your 'veteran' status while it is in fact **completely irrelevant**. You're just assuming you didn't get hired because you're a veteran. You don't know. This bit on the other hand shows why you didn't get hired:> Jealous about not having served in their youth, and now regretting that decision. The other half involves some sort of (1) astonishment at my knowledge/skillset/experience, (2) jealousy, and (3) gatekeeping.You didn't get hired because you're an asshole. Plain and simple. The people you got interviewed just smelled it a mile away. #I am a veteran with a degree (software engineer) with 20 years experience and I can tell you that you will be discriminated against in the workplace.   If I could do it over again I would leave anything about being a vet off of a resume and not discuss it on interviews.   You may be able to get in the door of a company (and they can check a box and get a tax break) but where I work vets go to the back of the line for promotions behind women and minorities.   I am not making this up as this is always talked about on the rumor mill.#[removed]#[deleted]#Well, that’s more or less what I was saying. #Depends on where you work.   I am a vet with a degree (20 years as software dev/eng) and a small company liked the veteran status and hired me but it had lower pay.    Working in the government (National laboratory) being a vet hindered me.   There are what we have noticed good ole boy networks and even groups affiliated with church (Mormons, Witnesses etc.) and to top that off you will be passed up for minorities and women.   Then there are people that just don't like veterans.   So it does depend on your situation.  #[deleted]#[deleted]#[deleted]#> Certainly nothing I couldn't teach myself if I decided it was worth learning.But have you? Nobody cares what you are convinced you could do if effort was applied. #“People like you” — you know absolutely nothing about me. And that phrase you have used speaks volumes about your paranoia. #Read what you wrote here without prejudice as I did. And you will see. #[deleted]#[deleted]#""Nonono, _everyone else_ smells like dog shit. It would _never_ be on the bottom of _my_ shoe!""#I totally agree that a lot of the technical skills you pick up in a CS degree won't be used in most programming jobs.  It becomes relevant when you perform more complex tasks. Amazon does a lot of complex work so they probably want people who already have a good foundation to go forward with. You *can* get there from self study, but I've never met anyone who has due to the amount of time and motivation it takes (I did plenty of studying for stuff I did not find immediately interesting because I had to). Your service in the military certainly taught you a lot of useful stuff, but it isn't the same thing. #Really? You think Big Data and ML, the stomping grounds for people with CS and Math PhDs, is going to be an easier time? Especially considering how discriminated you think you are for not having a degree..#[deleted]#I'm not questioning you ability to do it. I'm just questioning if you will have the proper motivation if you're complaining about not having a degree as a SWE.

Epilepsy;9mc8ct;1538977347.0;/r/Epilepsy/comments/9mc8ct/a_chart_i_made_for_my_girlfriend/;A chart I made for my girlfriend.;"[https://imgur.com/7Jn54DX](https://imgur.com/7Jn54DX)I do not have Epilepsy so I understand only a fraction of what my girlfriend goes through every day. However I've learned that one big issue my girlfriend has is that she views Epilepsy as either ""fixed"" or ""not"". There is no inbetween. I do not blame her for this mentality but I also think it's not balanced. Perhaps the fact that I've been studying Buddhism has made things feel more relative. So now I try helping my girlfriend see gradients. It's in the grey are that I think people can find genuine relief. However I also do not believe in giving meaningless advice. So I do not tell my girlfriend to just feel better for the sake of feeling better. Reasons for feeling better must be grounded in things that deliver efficacy.The above chart does a few things. First, it turns Epilepsy from a big unwieldily monster that hides in the dark into manageable stages that can be worked on. By staging things, it becomes less scary. Working on multiple stages is easier and also has a synergistic effect. This defeats the idea that a silver bullet is needed and anything less is worthless. Second, it shows how defeating earlier stages prevents later stages.I believe framing is important when discussing problems. Framing allows us to view wins and defeats differently. For example most people want to address problems at stage 1. However if problems could be addressed at stage 2 or stage 3 , then even though Epilepsy is not solved, you are effectively treating the issue and can have significantly quality of life improvements. But let's suppose stage 2 or 3 aren't applicable, then you have stage 4. The probability of someone somewhere in the world solving some stage is high, even if it's not the lowest possible stage.When it comes to technology I'm an optimist. I work silicon valley and I see new tech all the time. I strongly suspect that things like big data will create hugely impactful solutions at stage 2 and 3 in the next 5 years.I know some people are in the deepest darkest well of despair. And I know that in such a place the above chart will come across as asinine advice. This too is how my girlfriend reacted at first, but then she gradually opened up about trying new solutions. So I do not mean to act like this solves your problem. But if it helped my girlfriend, perhaps it can help others.I will provide links to some things in the list.[\[04\] Epistemic device](http://www.epistemic.com.br/)[\[05\] RNS/VNS Device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFlsk8pnmho)[\[06\] Ribcap](http://www.ribcap.ch/)**UPDATE 10/9/2018:**Made some changes based on comments and new thoughts.[https://imgur.com/pZPVmoQ](https://imgur.com/pZPVmoQ)&#x200B ";"There's one main thing I think you should change: Medication is NOT A BAD THING. ONLY ITS SIDE EFFECTS ARE. It should be in the green, not the red...#Hey great chart!  It looks like you put a ton of work into it.  You may also want to add ""support from your boyfriend"" to each one of those stages.  It shows that not only are you trying to ""solve problems,"" but that even if they don't work you are there to support her throughout this entire process.  A lot of people feel that having someone there with them is as important.  #This was really thoughtful and supportive of you. Your girlfriend is lucky to have such a wonderful partner to help her through this time. I too was recently diagnosed with epilepsy and I have to say I’d be completely falling apart if it weren’t for my boyfriend’s love and support. I’m so lucky to have him.#Valid point. I was trying show the relationship between medication and side effects. But you're right I should just just replace stage 6 (medication) with side effects.#I agree. I know one of my biggest battles/anxiety is all of the meds I have to take and that makes me feel worse about myself. I’m not sure much can mitigate the side effects - diet and supplements are good things to try, but seizure meds bring side effects. All of them (in my experience) but we (typically) have to take meds and don’t have a choice. But I love that you’ve made this. Just the fact you put time & effort into making a chart and want her to feel better about herself is amazingly thoughtful & supportive. #There are a few other things I would add/change honestly. But I've got school so they'll have to be later :P#I feel like the this could be less about the medication itself (assuming they work) and maybe more about the feelings about or reliance on medications? Like being irritated or embarrassed (presumably as a younger person?) about having to be on meds in the first place, and having to plan, prepare, take them with you, maybe set phone reminders that might go off at certain times when you're out, which then makes you pause what you're doing, pull them out, find something to drink, and take them. Then there's the incidences of it being med time and being unable to take them immediately or realizing that you've forgotten to take them, which bring their own brands of anxiety and fear. All of this can be awkward and inconvenient or kind of kill the mood or disrupt the flow of whatever you're doing.Maybe I'm totally off base, but it's one of the things that bugs me the most about it. Before, I could just grab my phone and wallet and be gone for hours. Now I practically need a backpack and an hour of prep just to go out for the day.The meds themselves, while obviously a great thing, can also feel like a ball and chain shackled to your ankle.And don't even get me started on the endless party that is my medical alert bracelet.#Yes please list any suggested changes. I'm all ears.A few considerations:&#x200B 1. Green items should be circles. Then a red line should be able to connect to circles. So for example ""\[03\] Medication"" should have a read line leading to the red circle ""side effects - stage 6"".2. After ""falling injuries - stage 4"" there should be a ""seizure detection - stage 5"" - this would represent technologies that cannot ""predict"" a seizure (stage 2) or counteract a seizure (stage 3), but which can at least detect a seizure while it's happening. Which allows family members to be alerted and come help said person."

PUTIN had been receiving conflicting advice on interfering from three separate and expert groups. On one side had been the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergei KISLYAK and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with an independent and informal network run by presidential foreign policy advisor, Yuri USHAKOV (KISLYAK's predecessor in Washington) who had urged caution and the potential negative impact on Russia from the operation/s. On the other side was former PA Head, Sergei IVANOV, backed by Russian Foreign Intelligence (SVR), who had advised PUTIN that the anti-CLINTON operation/s would be both effective and plausibly deniable with little blowback.

Russia is still largely working on GRU and FSB off the old KGB model, which works around pressure rather than sigint.BTW, easiest way to pick through the informational chaff is throw out all of it and work from the outside in.#Good information and thank you for the video.  However,> Of course, this article has yet to be traced to Anton Vaino, but rather only to an ""A. Vaino"" (which is not to say it necessarily isn’t him) with rather a large number of individuals bearing the last name and first initial based on even a cursory glance through social media, but that did not stop the immediate splurge of hysteria.I read the Sputnik News article as well, it, like RT, are propaganda pieces that can never be trusted.  Literally state-run information, worse than any biased publication in the western world.  There is no chance to ever assume journalistic liberty from them if some world event ever runs afoul of Russian interests.  Hence, one should not expose one's attention to them without knowing that they will never publish anything that is detrimental to their interests or narratives.For instance this particular piece is not accurate, as the co-author of the paper is cited as A. E. Vaino, not A. Vaino.  This is significant for several reasons.  First, Vaino's name is Anton Eduardovich Vaino leading credence to this.  The original paper: http://law-journal.ru/files/pdf/201204/201204_42.pdfAdditionally, the other co-author, Sarayev, was interviewed about this.   ""BBC Russian tracked down Viktor Sarayev, an award-winning economist and businessman who has co-authored a number of articles with Mr Vaino.""Sarayev and Vaino collaborated on several articles together, if Sputnik News were a serious news outlet, rather than state-run propaganda, then even cursory research would expose the truth which they would gain easier than a westerner.The think-tank, Ukrainian Independent Center for Political Studies, ties Vaino and Sarayev directly.http://www.ucipr.org.ua/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=545:putin-s-foreign-policy-game&catid=8&lang=en&Itemid=169>Views of Putin and his team on the foreign policy game are well described in the book ""The Image of Victory"" by the recently appointed Head of the Presidential Administration of the Russian Federation **Anton Vaino**, written in collaboration with Presidential Adviser Anton Kobyakov and scientist **Victor Sarayev.**An interesting research Sarayev worked on 3 years prior to the Nooscope article, was titled:  The  semantics of network contacts. Scientific and technical information. Series 1: Organization and methodology of information work. It was cited in at least 2 other interesting publications, which also cited the aforementioned article by Sarayev and A.E. Vaino titled: ""The image of Victory"" in the publication: Moscow: Institute of Economic Strategies of the Russian Academy of Sciences""Both were cited in:* 2017: The battle for the future: who will be the first in the world to master the monitoring and cognitive programming of subjective reality?""* 2018: ""The stability-saving process of the cooperative behavior of autonomous agents`teams in dynamic problematic spheres of the digital economy""  As well as, I'm sure, several others.---Lastly, it is fairly common knowledge that the Russians have been spreading conspiracy theories in the West for decades, specifically aimed at creating the nebulous cloud of information and the individuals and groups associated that are beneficial to manipulation against western interests.You're correct that it is not possible to know the full extent of the nooscope, by design and as part of a larger strategy, but it is tied directly into the Kremlin, as has been elucidated above.#Check out this frightening brief, from ""The battle for the future: who will be the first in the world to master the monitoring and cognitive programming of subjective reality?"">The key factor determining the victory in the battle for the future is not the territory, not the army and not the volume of financial, material and intellectual resources being involved. **The key factor of the victory is cognitive programming of subjective reality**: mass-individual adjustment of the semantic interpretation of the existence goal and life success to form the material future through self-adjustment of the surrounding subjective reality to the “image of Victory” in cognitive perception of oneself and the surrounding material, virtual and imaginary individual world. Special urgency is acquired by this factor in conditions of building a “digital economy”. The basis of such mechanisms constitutes noomonitoring as a tool for making a “cognitive snapshot” of subjective reality, forecasting, planning and metaprogramming on its basis the “image of Victory” by **forming in groups of individuals new knowledge about themselves and the surrounding world, as well as the structure of ideological and professional patterns for interpreting surrounding reality and its subsequent correction** within the personal management while **developing and implementing management decisions of individuals and groups as a basic reference point for managing groups of interrelated people, machines, technical, including information, systems and natural objects.**I've suspected something like this for a while.  When I learned of the Nooscope 2 years ago, that idea was solidified.  And since then, even more so.The future is now, but in reality what we already know of the future now, is long past.  Advancements have been made of which we will likely never know, and even if we did we could not fully comprehend with piecemeal knowledge and insight.  Nevertheless, after some fundamental introduction, it is very easy to understand what the capabilities of big data, machine learning, and AI are, and how it can be used for different interests.  The above, is but one of many articles focused on that convergence.#Thanks, fascinating.It seems likely that the Nooscope has aspects of both reality and unreality, which would fit the general pattern of most propaganda and that of Surkov, Vaino, and Putin specifically.Parts of the reality are inarguable, because they are standard practice for sophisticated digital marketers. Today it's possible to:1) Use AI to identify emerging trends and attitudes. 2) Target and influence micro-audiences in specific geographies (not just states, but specific voting districts).3) Use geofencing to capture mobile device IDs for audiences likely to be useful in the future (e.g. if you geofence the area surrounding every NRA event, every Trump rally, the major megachurches, etc it's possible to build a pretty good-sized audience of people who are likely to support Trump. Then, you can use Probabilistic methods to create large audiences of ""lookalikes"" for large-scale advertising. In some cases, Deterministic data is available -- [Facebook has been exploiting phone numbers provided by users for two-factor authentication for advertising purposes](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/you-gave-facebook-your-number-security-they-used-it-ads). A mobile phone number is one of the most permanent identifiers for any specific person. You might move to a different state or change your name, but you are less likely to change your mobile number.4) Customize advertising messages to subgroups to influence groupthink. Leverage social media influencers to do the same. AI can also help identify the optimal moment and device to influence people.5) Measure, learn, and refine your efforts as you go. None of the above is science fiction, it's daily reality. Imperfect, to be sure, but [it works and has been working for some years now](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#6641e8a66686).  Obama had a sophisticated digital marketing effort, and no doubt Hillary did as well. So this alone doesn't explain Trump's victory. A key difference IMO was Trump's eagerness to drag the fight into the gutter, and to leverage existing trends that are deeply divisive. All of the Kremlin's propaganda efforts were tremendously amplified by a lot of trends at or just below the surface. 1. Distrust of politicians (high since before Nixon, but solidified and amplified by Watergate and later scorched Earth attacks on the Clintons and Obama).2. American culture wars, religion vs securalism, urban elites vs the rustbelt, income inequality.3. Racism and nativism (the 2018 version of the GOP's [Southern Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy).4. The [hugely successful Koch brothers effort](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/books/review/dark-money-by-jane-mayer.html) to force once-laughable John Birch Society ideas into the mainstream. 5. A [not entirely unfair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent) distrust of the mass media, coupled with the algorithm-driven rise of [filter bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble), etc. The above is, I think, undeniably true and all in the realm of reality.What's less likely to be real is a sustainable method to program human behavior in a way that drives predictable results.Influence? Yes.Fan the flames of division? Yes.Get people to adopt crazy conspiracy theories (Pizzagate etc)? Yes. But real predictability? Probably not.But then again, if the outcome you want is broadly defined (create divisions in America and weaken NATO), then precision is not at all necessary. You just nudge things in the broad direction you want it to go and keep steering toward that outcome.#Meant to respond earlier, got caught up.Just want to say that I really enjoy your writing style and information.I think you nailed it in saying that true predictability is probably not possible but true precision may not be necessary if the goals are more broad.Just want to add that predictability operates on statistical proability, therein lies the precision. So not only is full programming of human or group behavior not imaginable, it is also not necessary because you can keep adjusting parameters until you get a sufficient outcome.The model I posted initially is something to that effect.  If you notice, one of the originating centers is the collection of information from TV, Internet, social networks, media etc. which is where new data emerges. These proliferate chaotically through everything else based on their timing, path, network, associated weight, and other aberrations. Thereupon they influence ""reality"" which is the convergence of data points, themselves having networks, weight, paths, etc. Effective and consisten influence of these primers, which is partly what this device is described as attempting, is a nigh insurmountable endeavor, but one that is imaginable.I haven't read the full translated paper, as I've only found it recently, but what it seems like so far is an overlap of many  philosophical concepts, combined with concepts from economics, psychology, sociology, computer science/mathematics, and chaos theory.It is an attempt at the science, and manipulation, of the mechanisms of action for human (and group) behavior, in the modern technological era. States of consciousness acting upon each other, affecting the direction of the following state, can theoretically be deconstructed by identifying and weighing the causal factors each brain is exposed to. This context building is incredibly unpredictable, but just like all things in statistics the more data points considered the easier and more precise is the predictability. In this case, the data points which can be increased in the analysis are at least the influencers, the over time reactions to influencers, and other brains doing likewise. From this we can see how each iteration leads to more effective predictability, to the point that any inconsistencies are just reentered into the feedback loop adapted by the device.I'm going to read the paper tomorrow, and take notes to digest it all. My background(s) overlap much with this, so I'm very interested in what type of insight is available to me upon reading. EDIT: Also, as you can see on the model, ""Future"" is the only part not extending towards anything else (naturally you may say). This is why I think it's related to Vaino's ""Image of Victory"" paper with Sarayev. The device is meant to influence the future by manipulation of data influencers, to affect reality (the chaotic soup of ever expanding data), the mind (via projections of expectations), and the image of the world, which are the prime factors affecting the future.#Thanks for the kind words, and your writing is a big part of the reason I'm here. I'll try to read the paper as well, to learn what I can. The TL DR of all this seems to be:Attempts to influence elections aren't new. What's new is that the tech is stronger and the social glue holding America together is weaker.Aim a stronger, more precise hammer blow at the weakest points and you can turn small cracks into major fissures#Great thread, thank you both for taking the time to share."

I will probably sell it along with a bunch of Xbox one games that I’ll never pick up again.As for PC, I hear you on that even though I never got into all of it.  Those prices are undoubtedly high, and there’s something about the plug-and-play couch gaming setup that seems like it’d be a pain to try and replicate on PC.Ultimately, I’m still feeling a little gaming fatigue myself lately, and I think once I have the money to do more recreational stuff I’ll be playing a lot less often.#Mhmm I see you didn't or try play Warframe, Free to play, awesome community and lovely friendly Developers, small team  (ar200ish ppl) with bigger heart than many and MANY AAA companies.

Not just from online playing and PC, but from gaming in general. Enjoy other stuff in life, like camping, reading or invest in other hobbies like photography and plane crafting (was it?) Just so that you can realise how much better is to play video games. It works for me. And when you go back to gaming, try joining a clan.

File Storage  Email  Blogging  Website Hosting  Disaster Recovery (offsite records don't burn)  Moving data between jurisdictions (bulletproof hosting)  Big Data  Advertising Servers  CPU/GPU intensive applicationsNow, of all of these applications, the only one that cannot be truly replicated by blockchain + local software is CPU/GPU intensive applications. If you want to make an ecommerce site, go for it! You can have all of the data hosted on the blockchain, and when you take a payment you pay in ether, and a smart contract notifies the shipper, and an escrow agent and everything just happens. The only problem is that blockchain grows. And grows. And grows. Until like a cancerous tumour it has grown to completely fill your hard drive. Now into this fray steps Iota. Iota can do everything that blockchain can do, but it can also handle cpu and gpu intensive applications through qubic. It can take the very best parts of cloud computing- the access to raw industrial computing powerhouses, and combine that with the best parts of blockchain- smart contracts and decentralization.But after that, the tangle- the fundamental foundation of iota actually shows promise for so much more. Just like bitcoin and ethereum are simply apps that live on blockchain, so too Iota is simply an app that lives on the tangle. It is the first tangle app, and that makes it special. However, there are innumerable use cases where the tokens represent not value, but physical objects. There are also use cases where the traded tokens are stablecoins that fluctuate with the real world value of national currencies. &#x200B some project ideas:  A DAI forex exchange (but on iota) In this exchange, no traditional cryptocurrencies are traded. The ONLY cryptocurrency that is traded is Iota. The rest of the currencies are DAI style cryptocurrencies that are pegged through the DAI methodology to the price of national currencies. The market itself has a 0% charge for market makers, and a .025% for market takers, capped at 25 miota. An Escrow and Item registry. You can register any serial number as a token, and record a description of that item, including a picture of the item. If the item is electronic, and has any electronic lock system or encryption system, the token that represents that item contains a set of methods to use a recorded lock or encryption key to activate the device. Transferring the token transfers ownership. As such, atomic swaps of sale could be performed, such that you could buy (and legally own+control) a car without ever having seen the owner, signing papers, or taking any action aside from dealing with the sale. In the marvel movies in the ironman vs hulk fight [https://youtu.be/FdWJ-Njeaig?t=3m](https://youtu.be/FdWJ-Njeaig?t=3m) tony stark asks an AI ""how quickly can we buy this building?"" as he throws the hulk into it. Notice that ownership of the structure is assumed to be transferred to him on the fly. This is what object tokenization allows for, except in the real world. Point, click, buy. But more importantly, it allows you to place buy and sell orders on all kinds of objects. Ever need to sell your car? Many people have ""For sale"" signs sitting out on their vehicles. In the future, people can register their vehicles at point of ownership, and the instant they feel like they want to sell their vehicles, they look for all of the buy offers that other people have placed on their vehicle. Dealership AI's, AI's run by normal people wanting to buy a car, and so forth. The deal is finalized, and the other person comes to take possession of it. No papers signed, no weeks of For Sale signs, nothing. Just one and done boom it's sold.

Cloud computing is the worst thing that could have happened. I sense companies and big business will eventually bring their data back in house take control of their data and move away from the cloud. the minute you send your data to the cloud you effectively lose control of that data.#i like this type of well written little story exploring a use case. makes it tangible.#I agree to some extent. Companies that specialise in big data are already centralising. However its up to innovations like iota to throw them off their game, and prevent them from extracting value end masse from local economies.#With iOS or Android that are basically cloud operating systems you already lost the data control even if its stored locally in your device. They can wipe your device remotely or read every file. Data centralization is bad, regardless if its cloud or with another method. Data distribution is what keeps the internet balanced. Cloud computing is not going to go away anytime soon but some companies might want to retake control of their data, I agree. Sadly, most softwares and even operating systems now can tap into your local data, no cloud required.Cloud computing is not bad. Data centralization is bad. And since most cloud vendors are now the same big tech companies, Google, Amazon and Microsoft, then yes, I understand how some people see cloud computing as a threat. I suspect the reason most of those tech companies are not interested in blockchain/crypto currencies is because they want to keep control of the data, they are not interested in any technology that promotes decentralization.

Your answers would go on a slip of paper, into a box, and stored in a warehouse. The only time anybody bothered to put the effort in to find that slip of paper was if there was a very compelling reason to spend time and money on investigating *you*.But now data collection is near-zero cost - and correlating historical information about you from nearly infinite sources is also near-zero cost. Which means you have NO privacy any more - and worse than that - you can be targeted purely based on your data, not because *you* were a person of interest.Everybody wants your data - from insurance companies who want to push the odds in their favour, to pharmaceutical companies that want to target susceptible people with fear campaigns to buy their products, to governments who want to fine/tax you more because they can, to hackers who want to impersonate you for any of a million purposes - they all want to store everything about you so they can automatically come to any conclusions they want.So - your data is *valuable*.

They legislate it, they steal it, they demand it, they threaten you for it.If history tells us anything - our data is going to become like any commodity - raped and pillaged.

Given that, the client would like to understand how common this is and be able to report on instances of change. So what was described to me as a desire was to take a snapshot every day of pertinent data and put it into a 'data lake'.  To my reading of the available literature, a little bit of a different beast than what most people are doing when they say data lake, but I can see the rationale.  But it seems like we'd have to do some level of manipulation to get here  i.e., I'd need at the minimum to add new random keys and datetime options to any affected tables so as to allow for uniqueness and date grained discrimination at report time.  Again, kind of violating the 'just put the raw data in there' idea that I have generally seen associated with a data lake.  This shop is running sql server 2008 though migrations to 2016 are possible for this component of the project if I understand correctly.  They are a fully vertical MS shop creating an ETL solution with SSIS / stored procedures if that is of any help.  Their existing databases are on premise, though I have asked people to kick the tires on the feasibility of moving this component to a cloud environment (probably azure).  All of that being said, does anyone here have any insight for me on similar efforts?  What went right, what went wrong, the right architecture, etc?  I would be very appreciative.Thanks! ;"Have you seen temporal tables https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/temporal-tables?view=sql-server-2017#>  the manager wants to create what is being referred to as a 'data lake'That's a problem.  When the manager tells you what the solution will be rather than providing requirements and letting you determine the best solution to meet those requirements, you're going to end up building the wrong thing.Collect the business requirements for what they need and how they will use it, THEN determine the best solution to meet those requirements.  Who is the upstream and how do they send their data to you? Do they send a daily file?  Is it a complete file or just the records which have changed since the previous file?#I think the problem is that ""data lake"" is more of a marketing than technical term - just like ""data warehouse"" before it.So, management wants a data lake since they've heard of that, and it's easy to get it funded. But Data Lakes tend to have very little validation, transformation, and curation.  Many people describe them as a dumping ground where users make sense out of raw data at query time.  As you've discovered there are many challenges in addressing data quality problems post-load in a Data Lake that supports schemaless data.  I'd suggest getting more ideas from Data Warehousing - where heavy validation, transformation, curation, deltas & versioning, and auditing are the rule rather than the exception.  A few more suggestions:   * Use an ETL process to manage data, schema consistency, auditing, etc.  If you have programmers then I'd write a custom one, rather than using SSIS/pentaho/informatica/etc, but only after doing a research on what works best.   * Versioning: you don't need a *temporal table* to manage data versioning - since data warehouses have been doing it for 25 years.  You just need a diff process and a timestamp that's part of your primary key.   * Original value columns: can be stored on regular production tables and make it easy to see rejected/modified values.   * Quality level - every row should be tagged with a quality_level that identifies how bad its issues are.  There should be a way to decompose all quality problems with any given row - whether via audit tables, logs, or columns that can be expanded for analysis.   * Raw & transformed tables: keep both if you can afford to   * Auditing tables: that keep track of records in & out of each step, as well as reject reasons   * Idempotency: You should be able to reload data - using new transform rules, perhaps handling changes to interpretation of incoming data without producing duplicate data.  This often involves diffing data, and some kind of batch_id that can tie the data to a prior data set, extraction, etc.#I'm guessing there aren't project managers, or they aren't being allowed to gather requirements. Terms are a flippant thing, but knowing what you should build is [half the battle](http://jp2.r0tt.com/l_edff8ce0-78a5-11e1-85a7-b54c7b500002.jpg). #The trick here is to monitor change in schema each schema of data has incremental version number. Now views are coming created on top of all these table versions to get the latest data aka snapshot.#No, I have not.   But I'm going to searching on them now!  Thank you very kindly for your response.#A company I was working at 5 years ago had this setup, but they didn't call them that.  Very neat and glad to see its built in now#> Collect the business requirements for what they need and how they will use it, THEN determine the best solution to meet those requirements.I have recommended we discuss the need for a full build snapshot vs some hybrid of an accumulating snapshot table to capture deltas.  Meetings to be held on that later.  So far, I've just heard, 'historical reporting' as a desire, but haven't dug into enough detail to understand if they really *need* a full damn snap of everything in the world to do that.  I can't envision a scenario, but I'm very new to their niche.> Who is the upstream and how do they send their data to you?Multiple inputs, some are file based that arrive weekly or monthly, one is a replicated database that is has some build of effective dating, though I'm not sure of level of detail.  There is another I've yet to lay eyes on.  The data set with the largest impact is the replicated database  I have yet to get a concrete understanding if previous situations wherein a critical value was modified included a mod date or not.   Thank you for your response.#Eh, kind of.  But yeah, most definitely I think most projects would benefit from additional lasers.  #That sure seems like it might be what your manager doesn't know he really wants.#I agree, basically every project could be made better by lasers.#Be sure to get both colors. It wouldn't be right without both. "

CryptoMarkets;9l0sk8;1538570480.0;/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/9l0sk8/dbxchain_introduces_real_business_applications/;DBXChain Introduces Real Business Applications;Since the introduction of Bitcoin, blockchain is already entering its third generation of technological leaps with Blockchain 3.0. Blockchain 3.0 will not only change the traditional relationships in an economic system, but also will overturn old classical economic system, and rebuilding world’s economic structure. The current change will make most crypto tokens obsolete.At the end of 2016, Tomi Wen, CEO of Beijing Digital Engine Technology Co. Ltd. and the founder of DBXChain, chose to get into blockchain market by working on the underlying system of public chain, data infrastructure in the blockchain world. Tomi Wen holds a bachelors degree from Renmin University, and is a tech geek. He developed software DIY-Page at age 15 and became “the software author that made Baidu changed its algorithm”.With DBXChain, Tomi aims at exceeding Ethereum and becoming the first large-scale feasible public chain by introducing the first public blockchain with real business use cases and projects integrated already before listing its token DBX on any exchange. For Tomi this is a statement about validating DBXChain as a credible blockchain among the so called “archaic blockchain”.“Archaic blockchain” refers to the projects that do not have real operations as support, but simply aim at attracting people to invest by issuing cryptocurrency. This became known after a recording was published where a prominent Chinese investor in the field revealed that many blockchain companies have no valid business goals. In the archaic blockchain era, majority of the projects are “illusions”, so that everyone swindles other people’s money. The recording event marks the end of “archaic blockchain” age. The new age of blockchain belongs to practitioners, not braggers. This kind of game will be aborted eventually. In the new age of blockchain, those people who work with technological and business progress in mind way will win.DBXChain has not only their blockchain testnet already available, but it wants to introduce an ecosystem that allows for true decentralisation. DBX’s main goal is to provide unprecedented blockchain products or services to redefine data exchange ecosystem. This new value-based ecosystem is a decentralized community that provides a platform for users to explore and exchange data. This exchange process is safe and users are able to own their data with rights.A decentralized ecosystem is able to attract interested investors and developers. DBXChain uses a consensus mechanism D-DPoS that they spent more than a year developing. It has two key features: first, transaction capacity is greatly improved by a representative system and sharding technique so that it meets the requirement to make an application feasible. Second, security issues, due to oligarchy and centralization by a representative system, are solved by using a real-time fluid “super role” to replace regularly elected “super nodes” and by balancing the importance of subjective choice and objective contribution in an election mechanism.DBXChain’s main business is data infrastructure that releases data’s value and “atomizes” data transactions. A connection that were impossible to release value has been made possible in a new blockchain operation system. Artificial intelligence (AI) will also benefit the ecosystem from big data accumulation and better computing powers.DBXChain aims to build a business model that emphasizes on revenue from applications. DBXChain will support many developed businesses, which already have a large volume of data on classical internet. These data will test the capacity of DBXChain networks and its security.For example, DBX will offer a convenient data sharing tool in the form of DApp so that users are able to share their data with public selectively and voluntarily while keeping their privacy. For example, the popularization of mobile payment has generated massive transaction data. Users can share their transaction data by uploading screenshots of receipts voluntarily. This way users actively choose if they want their data to be collected. Additionally, these data might be used by many different parties with users’ authorization: a financial institution needs to sell credit products  a market research group wants to understand consumption. User get benefits every time data are used.DBXChain is also in cooperation with the app SuperFans. SuperFans allows stars/celebrities to connect to their fans by decentralized communications achieved by DBX. It reduces the costs of communication between stars and fans and explores more interesting and effective business models for fan economy such as more personalized fans service and engagement etc. It shows a possibility of blockchain reforming future entertainment economy.By the end of 2018, DBX aims to have 50 projects available online that goes beyond finance field. DBX has been actively developing projects in the fields of game, social, IoT, AI etc.;I think it is necessary to mention that the team works really herd to update their social networks. There are a lot of information not only about the project, but so other interesting information#As far as I understand, the team presented a technically rather complicated project which is based on its own file structure, am I right?#What are the distinctive features of this project? I want to know why such a large number of participants join the project? How is it useful to people?

The idea of diversifying is that some firms will go up and some firms will go down on any given day. We are essentially eliminating this portion of risk, which is called idiosyncratic risk. If you look at any market portfolio, it should have a beta of 1. Beta, by definition, is market risk. Your suggestion to go long and short firms in the same industry is a hedging related motive. That is not the same as diversifying. #Definitely no technical analysis. We follow the methods of many top investment funds and use a top-down approach in research. #Because that's not diversifying#>The definition of being diversified is to eliminate firm-specific risk by holding large enough a basket of firms across different industry.Right, but that's exactly what I'm saying--when you have a beta of 1, everything is correlated, nothing is actually, fundamentally, in reality, diversified.If VIX explodes like in Feb, or rate hikes go faster than anticipated on the dot chart, or Trump tweets about whatever, or eurodollars lose relative strength to dollar-yuan your portfolio goes along with it.Everything in your portfolio is correlated and therefore, not diversified.>If you look at any market portfolio, it should have a beta of 1.

cscareerquestions;9nqxfn;1539403023.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9nqxfn/a_senior_colleague_of_mine_compared_programming/;A senior colleague of mine compared programming to Ruling over a country..;"So, I don't get along at all with this guy at work. I have less than 1 year of experience and he has over 20 years. He is objectively the smartest person in the team. Holds a masters degree in Mathematics from Cornell. Everytime there is any sort of issue in the team, the team lead asks him for his advice. He is legitimately one of the smartest person I know. He is horrible at communication though. Like me he is not a native English speaker. He is barely audible, he hates repeating himself. Starts screaming, when confronted. His plans are pragmatic but less glamorous. I like glamorous technologies, I like big data stuff.  He hates big data technologies. All in all, what he says makes sense, yet it is not immediately obvious what his plans are, but if I give it sufficient time, his plans become clear to me.Every now and then, I feel bored with what I am doing and defy him and involve Apache spark in the project or use X technology/library to solve a problem when it is not needed. Most of the people in my team have at least 10 years of experience and I am the youngest person in this team. Everyone in the team detests me for it. They have been very vocal about it. My team lead likes the fact that I am pulling all the new technologies into the team. He even wrote about it in my latest performance review. His words were ""One of the advantages of having him on the team is that he likes to try out different technologies and challenge established order. But he also needs to realize that once a decision has been made, he has to stick with that decision even if he doesn't like it"".Now, about a week ago, I got into major trouble with him. My team primarily deals with Python and we inherited a Java code base from some other team. We had to integrate that code base into out systems. I was told to write a Python wrapper for it, using command line to invoke it. I really felt it was a bad idea and modified the code base and made it write directly to the entry point service. My team lead was okay with this and two other guys in the team were okay with it too. Even my team lead's boss was okay with it too. But this guy lost his shit and started screaming at me, told me that I need to be open minded and listen to other people's ideas. He went on to say that he has been doing this job for 20 years and he went through all these phases of experimentation and learnt these patterns that could streamline the development process.. etc.. etc.. His argument was that what he was suggesting would take 1 day at most, would be fairly easy to maintain, but what I did took me more than a week and a half and if there is any problem with the inherited code base, it wouldn't be obvious if the code I introduced caused the problem or if it is generally a bug in that code base itself.I kind of felt offended by the way he said it, but I can understand why he is angry and I do agree with him. He told me an interesting analogy, where he compared a server farm with a country. Each server is like a state in a country and we have to look after the memory, cpu time disk space etc., He says that in 2018 a lot of these things are automated, but we he started programming he had to be aware of the internals of a lot of systems. To become a good ruler, you have to study the methods of previous kings, understand the culture, actively try to gain experience.From today, I candidly want to put an effort to become better at my craft. I want to become more pragmatic like him. To this end, can someone recommend me books, articles, blogs, youtube channels that I should be actively reading/watching? Anything from software design to performance tuning to security! I want to diversify and deepen my knowledge. I have a masters degree in Computer Science, so I can handle fairly complicated material.";"There's a fine line between pushing the envelope and trampling all over institutional culture. I think you're doing important things for them, but I suggest working on your ""soft skills"" so you can get more of the entrenched personnel on your side than against you.""We've always done it this way"" is certainly toxic, but you also need to pick your battles, yes?I've heard good things about the book ""Soft Skills for Programmers,"" but I haven't read it myself.Good luck!#I don't agree with him screaming at you, but from the limited information I have, I agree that the last thing you want to do is modify the Java code base unless absolutely necessary. I would avoid doing that at all costs. I'm assuming the Python wrapper in this case would communicate to the Java code base by running it and reading/writing data from stdio.If something was wrong with that Java code, you'd want to be able to blame the other team for it, by saying that you never even touched it. Plus its Java. Once you modifiy the code base, you're kind of taking ownership of it.#You can always learn from these guys...#There's nothing grizzled old dudes love more than sharing their personal wisdom with you. If you can figure out how to get him talking in that ruling over a country vibe whenever you get a chance I promise he'll like you more and you'll get along better and you'll probably learn some stuff.The fact that you wrote this in a way that pays service to both of your viewpoints in an emotional situation already puts you ahead of 95% of people imo. Whatever you do will probably be on the right track.I know you asked about books and we're all kind of ignoring that, but whatever.#> Every now and then, I feel bored with what I am doing and defy him and involve Apache spark in the project or use X technology/library to solve a problem when it is not needed.> My team lead likes the fact that I am pulling all the new technologies into the team. He even wrote about it in my latest performance review.I strongly dislike when people do this. That new hotness you're importing is shit I have to deal with in 2 years when no one knows how it works and you got bored and moved to a new job. If there is a compelling reason to use something, then use it. But you being bored is not a compelling reason.  Angry guy is very likely correct on this.>  I was told to write a Python wrapper for it, using command line to invoke it. I really felt it was a bad idea and modified the code base and made it write directly to the entry point service.I no care, I do what I like is not acceptable in a professional setting. If there is a agreed upon design, then you should do that. If you disagree with the design, then propose a new design and get it signed off on. Angry guy is correct on this.> My team lead was okay with this and two other guys in the team were okay with it too. Even my team lead's boss was okay with it too. They were okay with it as in they don't care you can do what you want, or they agreed that your proposal was a better solution? There's a pretty vast difference between the two. Angry guy is likely correct on this.> Starts screaming, when confronted.This is not acceptable from angry guy.#Book recommendation: The pragmatic programmer. I'm still reading it, but it's pretty good so far.#Whether or not he's toxic or you're toxic or he has bad soft skills or you have bad soft skills or whatever, the fact that he's sitting down and giving you this talk means that he wants you to improve.  He doesn't want to play games and fuck with you, he just wants you to listen.I've been in situations like this before and they're a fantastic chance to consciously change your behaviour.  They will notice if you do this and the level of respect from your colleagues will improve dramatically.If the old guy really is good at his job and you want to continue the relationship and get mentorship from him, first thing you should do on Monday is tell him that he was right.  Next time you have a crazy idea, ask him whether he's tried doing something similar in the past.  You don't have to agree with everything he says but you do need to respect his experience and listen to everything he has to say.  It's easier to spend 30 minutes talking about it than a week and a half implementing it then realising it's bad."

I would break that down in the following ways:* If you are trying to understand the methods like Map Reduce: No, study the python implementations* If you are trying to deploy Big Data solutions to solve problems: No, use the huge number of API layers instead (i.e. Amazon EMR) or even better abstract away the whole mental model with solutions like Pig [https://pig.apache.org/](https://pig.apache.org/) which basically lets you think in SQL* If you are trying to tweak Enterprise Grade Solutions to work differently for your use case: Yes, start learning to use Java.

Over the months, I taught myself a new programming language and build a working prototype of a program that intelligently finds data, ingests it, transforms it, and models it.  In theory, the output would be useful either to businesses or investors in those businesses to make them sweet, sweet $$$$.&#x200B Problem is, I didn't follow a cardinal rule of startups: I didn't identify a problem and build a solution for it. I have no actual proof that anybody even wants this service/product/whatever. So I've hit a point where I don't know a way forward because I don't know what anyone wants it to ultimately do.&#x200B My question is how do I find the right people to talk to about what they're looking for and what I can do for them. How do I move past the ""Does anyone want this?"" stage and get a solid answer to that question? Do I find a mentor? A professional representative? Do I just start cold calling someone? And who?&#x200B What's my game plan from here?";"The reason you are supposed to find a problem then make a solution is that there is a much better chance of success that way. Hopefully, you enjoyed learning the programming language and building the prototype and learned something transferrable from doing that. You might be able to push forward here but you are going to have to get lucky and spend a whole bunch of time marketing and interacting with people to find those in need of your solution. It's hard to say whether a mentor would help or if you should reach out to groups, if you should launch and offer the output, if you should try selling the tool or if you should ally with a company without specific information about the product. The range of possible approaches is just too broad. #You probably should just start going fishing. Right now you have bait. All you can do is throw your bait out there and make sure you have a solid line connecting it to yourself, and hope someone interested in the bait catches on and contacts you about it. Eventually you'll probably learn of better spots to start fishing once you even start fishing even randomly anywhere.I have no clue what you did, you very vaguely described the project you built. You need to advertise what you have with plenty of examples.You sound like an experienced programmer. Imagine that you had no clue which company you wanted to work for but you know you have the skills. The way you'd probably go about it is make a profile with all your programming examples, toss it out there in the wild and start advertising yourself. Eventually interested parties should be contacting you about it. You'd do the same here.Also show an example of what your data modeling program does. I'm curious. You made a throw away make it useful.#If you didn't figure that part out, there are probably a bunch of other things you didn't consider either. I would start with meeting with an SBA representative because if you want to be a business that doesn't fail because you didn't cross all of your t's and dot all of your i's, jumping right into finding customers is a good way to regret what you have done.Fortunately, part of meeting with an SBA rep or business consultant will assist you in identifying what is called product market fit. A resource that you can privately use without involving anyone else is available at[http://www.ycombinator.com/resources/](http://www.ycombinator.com/resources/)with a MOOC for founders available[https://www.startupschool.org/](https://www.startupschool.org/) \- Registration is closed so you will just be following the course material for your own benefit.I'm encouraging a mix of offline and online resources so you maintain accountability to yourself.#You could approach a company that you think may find it useful and then show them what it can do and then get them to suggest if it can give them value for any specific use cases, if you do this for a handful of companies one of them is sure to suggest what to do.#Hi ... I'd say the best bet would be to identify players already in the market that could do with adding your idea into their solution. This could add value to their offerings and give you the headstart you need to become profitable, Then when you understand the ideal user's profile, you could pivot your business towards that end.#> Hopefully, you enjoyed learning the programming language and building the prototypeIndeed I did.  I followed the *other* principle of entrepreneurship, which is to do what you can, when you can. The idea came when it came.  Programming, I could do right away. Selling the whole thing, well...that I don't know how to do.>without specific information about the product. I just replied in another comment that essentially my value is that I can tell you what a company's earnings will be before they announce it. That gives investors an information advantage, I believe.#Where would I go about advertising, though? Not on the radio...it's not a consumer product.  Not Facebook ads...no way I'd hit *that* niche. I'd pretty much have to call up the right people and say ""What do I have to do to get in front of you?"" but that's the part I need help with.  I'm willing to advertise this, but don't know where to even start.As for what the program does, let me just say that I claim (and I admit this needs verification and testing still)  I can tell you how much money, say, Walmart made last quarter. I can give you their EPS before Walmart announces it publicly.  So my value is that I can say that Walmart  (for example) will announce that they beat earnings last quarter by $.05 per share (for example). I can also tell you *where* they earned their money, to an extent.And not just Walmart, but a whole bucket of major corporations. The user can do with that info what they will, whether that's buy Walmart stock before earnings reporting, or something else.Since this all comes from data algos and techniques, I'm sure you understand why I can't just post it here.#Thanks for the references. I'm familiar with the SBA, but I didn't know they had those sorts of resources available.#Do you think I should just call them up, say ""I have a fledgling idea, and will you look over it?"" How should I prepare for that initial meeting?#An interesting idea. Thank you.#If that is what you've got then you have a much easier time than anyone has described. That information can be directly and immediately traded on for profit in the stock market. (Providing these forecasts are not based on insider information which would be illegal). Simply go to anyone with a reasonable amount of money who trades the market, explain what you've got, provide them earnings for a company reporting next week that will be significantly different from earnings and wait for a call after the announcement. The second time ask for half the investment gains. You should be very wealthy in very short order. Don't commit to any lasting use of your product because as soon as you have a history you are going to get calls from very wealthy companies.The only problem is that you might not actually be able to deliver future earnings. Accuracy and consistency really, really matters. Anyone can predict predictable earnings, it's estimating unexpected changes that matter.#So if your data was something more ""general"" my reply would be. You make a website, you write blog posts you post in /r/dataisbeautiful For your specific data you can just try to sell it to stock trading companies and try to get hired as a quant. There is places like /r/algotrading and even a websites dedicated to that stuff.But you really need to openly advertise it. You have to prove what it can do. You don't have to go into exact details but you can't just say ""I have a secret data gathering method, if you pay me I'll show you what it can do"". Sounds like you're doing something similar to https://www.earningswhispers.com/ they openly advertise their data they have and sell a premium service for more specifics.#Those are Y Combinator resources. Y Combinator is a world class start up incubator. Maybe, the best in the world.#Yeah.. Say that you have a new technology that models data and would like to discuss if it can help their business in any way. If you're casual and arrange a meeting then ask if they or any companies they know may be interested if it can solve any pressing problems they have.. keep doing this for a few and if anyone suggests a problem and other companies have the same problem then you've got your ""generic"" use case and build it for that customer and sell it to more customers.. otherwise if they do not think it's good enough then ask another company until someone does.. if they do suggest a problem and it's unique to them like you have to customize per customer then you have a service business and will have to do customized solutions at a higher price finding similar companies.It will also give you some exposure to the market and business contacts so maybe you find some other problem that they suggest which you can solve instead during this exercise.#Thanks, I thought so :)#> directly and immediately traded on for profit in the stock market. (Providing these forecasts are not based on insider information which would be illegal). These forecasts are definitely not insider information. It's no more insider than the phone book.Unfortunately, providing a prediciton, free of charge, and then charging for a future prediction is a well known scam.  Even if I'm on the up-and-up, no one will think I am. They'll think it's a pidgeonhole scam.>Accuracy and consistency really, really matters.I still have to prove this thing even works.  That's a bummer.  On the plus side, my lil robot friend just added 2,487 economic datapoints to the repository, so I got that goin' for me. Which is nice.#Sorry, I meant I didn't know the SBA had assistance with product market fit.#Take heart, everybody always has to prove their stuff to their market no matter what the product.The thing about prediction is that it is often faked but also pretty easy to set up circumstances where it can't be faked. A skeptical analysis is going to be fair to a real process or it doesn't qualify as analysis. Truthfully you could offer 2 or 3 or 6 forecasts without charging as it costs you very little. That would let you set up to sell output without talking (much) about how you created it. "
ethtrader;9ksavt;1538498866.0;/r/ethtrader/comments/9ksavt/blockchain_and_data_a_necessary_synergy_for_the/;Blockchain and Data — A Necessary Synergy For The Survival of Blockchain and Data — A Necessary Synergy For The Survival of Blockchain;**The need of Data in Blockchain**The dawn of Blockchain is awaiting its full potential with crypto enthusiasts and newly started companies ready to capitalize on its technology for true mass adoption. The enthusiasts have firm belief Blockchain will be applied throughout industries and transcend traditional services, apps and consumption to new levels. However it is one crucial aspect that have been ignored by the industry which will be fundamental in the adoption of Blockchain, and that is Data. Most Blockchain companies are focusing on transactions and usage of their cryptocurrency, but the only way blockchain will be able to compete against traditional systems is to enable real world applications and services. And that requires data-exchange.First of all, for all current applications and services, data plays important role to conduct data analysis and make business decisions. Investment banking staff have to know the financial data of the IPO company  a luxury brand has to collect data showing by how much proportion household spent their income on luxury goods. All industries are surrounded by data, we can not live without data support. Beyond the need for Data to conduct business, the very technical aspects of applications and services involves the management and exchange of data. Hence, to allow Blockchain to compete against current systems, but most of all to be able to integrate and functions with these systems  data-exchange will need to be in its core.The essential spirit of DBXChain is data. No matter the future applications, the already launched “Data Game”, or the ecosystem community in the final step, all those functions are data based.However, it does not stop there. The reason why DBX wants to build up a public chain which main focus is data is that traditional systems and services have major shortcomings in their way of managing big data that neither are fair to data suppliers, nor efficient to data demanders.Let’s discuss this further.**The need of Blockchain in Data**How Data has been access, stored and shared in the classical internet & Big Data industry have almost been in the form of oligopoly. Data of you is used by big internet companies to generate huge amount of profit without your control. For example, Facebook can collect and export all data about you from your interactions on their platform. However, you are not able to get any reward by providing your information or data to Facebook. In fact, your information could be used by so many companies for different types of purpose through variety of ways without your consent.Additionally, there are several conundrums existing in the traditional data exchange approach. In macro point of view, the supply side is much heavier than the demand side. Tons of data, in so many ways, are generated second by second in our daily life but people in a certain industry might only need a small section of the whole data, leaving the remaining part aside. This is no doubt a kind of data waste, namely we do not utilize the data fully or effectively. Among different types of data, it lacks of logic to connect each type of data, resulting more and more data islands.Furthermore, traditional systems have great issues with data precipitation. Data precipitation refers to the issue of an original data supplier inability to benefit from any following transaction on his data. Imagine three people A, B and C, try to trade data between each other. A owns the data demanded by B and C. Initially, B comes to A and successfully purchases data. Then, he extracts the specific data section he needs just as to precipitate the data of A, and forms his own data with a more attractive charge. In this way, C could naturally go to B instead of A, the original data supplier, to trade. After purchasing data from B, C precipitates the data one step further and trade with other people, which has nothing to do with A and B. In such business model, every intermediate trader tends to precipitate the data and the original data supplier cannot benefit from any following transaction on his data.However, Blockchain, characterized by its decentralized encrypted and open spirit, serves as an ideal solution to the problems existing in the big data industry. DBX Foundation, as a leading public chain company in the blockchain industry, is established just in order to solve the puzzles mentioned above. DBXChain provides unique distributional data storage on its side chain and data analysis and computing online service to satisfy specific need of companies from different industry, which is not quite available by other blockchains. On DBXChain, you can find whatever data you ask but also be able to analyze the data. DBXChain will will let data owners benefit themselves by their data  a more advanced data exchanging approach which could target at certain section/field of data  and an incentive mechanism to stimulate data owners to keep participating in exchanging their data on DBXChain.;Sounds like how Chainlink will bring Data into smart contacts.#This technology is contrary to what is used by many companies now, is not the transition to such a platform difficult for many?

As I know they have plans to conduct test of decentralization to prove it. Main and trusted nodes are chosen randomly for each round - this is the way how they reach decentralization.#You don't know anything about Credits and make such statements. Acting like a kid. Recently there was an Internal Load Test (1 stage) which was aimed to check peak network load or max amount of TPS which platform can handle in 1 second. It was done on 32 nodes located in 6 countries all over the world. This test was done in real time mode on Credits YouTube channel - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uLi4sU9OI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-uLi4sU9OI).Check link below to be aware of information and don't look like an idiot.Important report points:1. Peak Number of 1,327,152 Transactions per second2. Average number of 130,400 Transactions per second3. Total amount of transactions - 305,136,0004. Peak Number of 685,122 Transactions in a Single BlockFull test report article [https://credits.com/en/Home/New\_Ins/4161](https://credits.com/en/Home/New_Ins/4161)#Is it trustless and permissionless?#Thanks for proving my point 32 nodes is nothing. #Is it trustless and permissionless?#In my opinion Credits made huge improvements since ICO, team is open and transparent and working hard on product. I trust them#It is just 1 stage of testing. Soon Credits is going to conduct 2 stage of testing. Everybody will be able to participate in it, set up a node and sent transactions to the network. Team is aimed at more than 500 nodes during this stage. #I mean if their blockchain is trustless and permissionless, these are technical terms. #Enjoy seeing exponential decay in TX speeds with more nodes. #How can you care about a Blockchain being trustless and at the same time trust someone to provide you that answer on Reddit?&#x200B They have a decent amount of technical explanations on their website. &#x200B It's supposed to be trustless and permissionless. Obviously some concessions have to be made on the trust side to push the txs count but not blockchain is truly trustless anyways. #Trustlessness isn’t black and white, it’s a spectrum. The trustlessness relevant here is within the consensus algorithm if it’s trustless between nodes or not. #Not all nodes validate all transactions as this obviosuly wouldn't be possible at 1mln tps. It's more of a round of selected nodes that validate transactions and then broadcast the result to other nodes. So nodes kind of have to trust others but they are trusting a majority decision of randomly selected nodes. #Hm this is very similar to Ripple, Stellar, which are both not that decentralized because their nodes are also permissioned and non trustless. #This has nothing to do with decentralization though apart from the fact that it is what actually allows decentralization despite high txs. It's definitely permissionless too. I wouldn't call it non trustless but it's definitely not as trustless as Bitcoin or such. I don't know too much about Stellars tech but comparing it to Ripple is probably not that accurate.Not saying it's anything right now and it might be much less trustless than they presented so far but in theory it's probably about as trustless as you can be with high txs.#Good that it’s permissionless, but trustlessness is one of the most important factors for decentralization. If you need to sacrifice decentralization for scalability to get to 1M tps, then it doesn’t really count.We already have lots of non trustless scalable blockchains that can do lots of tps, but no one wants that. People want a blockchain with trustless, permissionless nodes without mining pools that can do several million TPS. Currently only Nano, Elastos, holochain and Iota at scale seem to be able to do that. #>Currently only Nano, Elastos, holochain seem to be able to do that. I am sorry but apart from Nano, those haven't really done anything so far. Credits hasn't really proven anything either and is considered a scam by many but they have a bunch of partners(the vast majority of whom are tiny but then there are also legit partners like a Lenovo subsidiary) and have shown(unless it is completely fake) that their platform is at least somewhat capable of what they claim. >We already have lots of non trustless scalable blockchains that can do lots of tps, but no one wants that. Which decentralized platforms are currently able to do high tps counts? Sure some go in the thousands but that's pretty much where it ends, 100k plus opens up entirely new possible dapps. Try making an exchange with 1k tps. #Elastos and iota have huge partnerships, 20x more than Credits. For example, the next dapp launched on elastos is viewchain, which is owned by zebpay who have 500M users.>  Which decentralized platforms are currently able to do high tps counts? Sure some go in the thousands but that's pretty much where it ends, 100k plus opens up entirely new possible dapps. Try making an exchange with 1k tps.If you consider non trustless platforms decentralized, then Xlm, xrp, lisk, ark, ontology, neo, icon, vechain, omg, rchain, zilliqa. Many of them can do 100,000-1M tps and many have many and huge partnerships. #IOTA is great imo but at round about 100x the value. If Zebpay has 500M users then I am nigerian royalty.>If you consider non trustless platforms decentralized, then Xlm, xrp, lisk, ark, ontology, neo, icon, vechain, omg, rchain, zilliqa. XRP and XLM are huge already though. The rest cannot do anywhere near that amount of TPS. Rchain I like a lot as I have dabbled a little with the logic it's supposedly using for its dapps, elegant stuff.  I think there is huge inherent value to having high possible TPS on a platform, you simply cannot do things with 2k tps that you can do with a million TPS. High TPS without smart contracts might be quite useless though.#Sorry I mean zapya has 500m users, that’s the one.No one needs centralized blockchains with 1m tps. They already exist and are called servers.

ITCareerQuestions;9pbdmz;1539883760.0;/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9pbdmz/fastestbest_way_back_in_for_me/;Fastest/best way back in for me.;Hello. I've spent the last five years as a teacher in public schools. I'm burned out totally and education is a big mess in my area of the country right now. I want to go back into IT. I do have a bit of a background but much of it is in my past. It started in HS when I helped install the area's first Windows 3.1/Banyan Vines network at our school. After graduation I left for the Army where I was a medic but upon returning I got a job doing T1 HelpDesk at HostGator. I did that for about a year until I was included in a round of layoffs. I went and started my own reseller web hosting business that was ultimately unsuccessful. I would say the best skill I took away at the time was the ability to build a PC, install a Linux distro, make it a server, and get it on the internet. From there I worked as a QA engineer for MediaFire, testing their desktop and mobile apps for bugs and putting together and maintaining testing environments.  Unfortunately I was laid off again about 18 months into the gig with the rest of my team. I was frustrated and sought stability so I went into education. Five years later and my passion for computing has been rekindled and I'm looking at my best way back in. I don't hold any certifications and I have a non-IT bachelors degree. I am also in my 40s and believe with my knowledge, experience, and grit that I can attain a non-entry-level position in IT. I see myself as a network or big data guy, there is a Level 3 data center nearby that I'd love to work at one day. What is my best way back in? Thank you so much for your responses.;You must prove your worthiness in a trial by fire at the gates of Mount Maoola.#[deleted]#One non-conventional way back in without starting at entry level might be to look into company training positions, so that your teaching experience directly benefits you, then start getting into teaching more technical courses.  Really, though, I think the suggestions already made like getting your CCNA and then applying for junior networking positions are more likely to get you back into IT more quickly.#How rusty is your Linux experience?  Based on the way my phone rings, I would say if you can get a RHCSA and put together decent Dice and Linkedin profiles you would have a 6 month contract (that would pay more than some teachers make in a year) before Christmas.  Once you get an IT title, it's not hard to get another, just contract jump until you find somewhere to stay.&#x200B Before Reddit freaks out, to make more than the annual salary entry level teacher in Oklahoma in 6 months, you would not need to break $30/hour (if you were at least full time).#With no degree, you're going to be fighting an uphill battle as those mid-level positions usually get hundreds of applicants with a large majority having degrees and/or significant relevant experience. While you probably are above an entry level position, it may be the best way to get your foot in the door. You may see if that L3 data center has any NOC positions, which can be seen as entry level, but you can usually work your way up as it's a larger organization with many arms. #Thank you. Are there any specific job titles that I should focus on or pay attention to?#Thank you! I will look for some training positions as well. Can you recommend some job titles in both training and junior networking to search for? Again, thanks for the response.#Thank you for the advice. Admittedly my Linux is a bit rusty but I have my home lab where I run different distros through VirtualBox. I'm in the process of refreshing my command line knowledge. I will see if I can find a good recruiter in the area.#I do have a degree however. It's clearly stated above. It's just not in an IT discipline.#I've seen plenty of people with non-IT related degrees get jobs in IT. Low to Low/MID level. Depends on the recruiter and the manager. If you get past that and can swing the interview you may succeed. I've seen so many people come in and out and then back in to the IT industry. There are plenty of jobs to be had because of low retention/high turnover rates. There are some crap IT jobs and then there are some GEMS. Don't give up. Just make sure you resume isn't stupid long with no substance. Make it short with enough to get them interested. Certs are the way of the industry these days. You already have a degree. I was the type of degree matters sometimes, but mostly IT manager want to see that you actually can read, follow directions, collaborate, and get the task done. That's what I was told. And it may be true. My wife new a guy that worked in the post office for the army. 5 years after that he got he stopped playing videogames for a few months,  got his CCNA, then got a decent job. Now he is a lead Network Admin. It isn't impossible. Just have to try and get as much advice as possible. #Sorry, was talking an IT degree. With no IT degree and no relevant/recent IT experience, it will be difficult for someone to take a chance on mid-level or higher positions. It would probably come down to knowing someone and then nailing the interview.In addition to the CCNA that was mentioned (if networking is your passion or chosen path), I'd recommend hunting LinkedIn, Meetup and the like for local IT happy hours or interest groups. It's possible you could get a back door in that way if you come across someone with an opening and they see your passion and personality.

CryptoMarkets;9ks31x;1538497415.0;/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/9ks31x/challenging_ethereum_dbx_public_chain_offers_a/;Challenging Ethereum — DBX Public Chain Offers a New Business Application Model;**DBXChain**As many of new public chains became available on mainnet this year and openly compete with blockchain product like Ethereum , 2018 has been known as ‘the first year of public chains’. Public chains have been drawing lots of attention in blockchain markets. DBXChain might be a main competitor to Ethereum in the near future.DBXChain, released by an internationally well-known public chain research team named DBX Foundation, is a value-based ecosystem of data based upon blockchain. This new value-based ecosystem is a decentralized data community that provides a platform for users to explore and exchange data. It provides a safe data exchange process and users are able to own their data rights. This new ownership with data is based upon blockchain technology.**Original DDPoS optimizes the consensus mechanism of blockchain**DDPoS is a new consensus mechanism that is created by DBXChain for the first time in the world. It helps resolve oligarchy and security issues from DPoS consensus mechanism by EOS. As everyone knows, DPoS consensus mechanism is similar to a shareholding system and its problems are quite obvious: first, it has a low voting rate.More than 90% shareholders never voted. It is because it takes time, energy and skills to vote, which are what most investors do not have. Additionally, there are many challenges dealing with bad nodes. If interfering nodes can’t be checked during a community election, it will put web security at risk.Then, how does DDPoS help resolve security and oligarchy issues while keeping its capacity at the same level? DDPoS makes the whole node selection system “fluid” so that block producer becomes a role, not a node, and this role can be transferred to other candidate producers at any time.With continuous data exchange at the bottom level of DBX public chain, the coupling level between a node and the whole ecosystem will be counted into an election system using weighted algorithm. During this process, users can vote at anytime, and DBXChain thus helps dodge potential bribery and security issues under DPoS system.**Enhance TPS and improves consensus efficiency**Blockchain is a distributed system, and a main factor that affects TPS is networks. Due to a large amount of nodes in a blockchain network are scattered around the world, the web state of each node is uncontrollable and it is hard to set a requirement to their bandwidth or to make sure everyone have access to stable network. This kind of situation is absolutely a disaster to TPS.Compared with underlying systems of “classic blockchain” such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, DBXChain is able to support more nodes– more than ten thousand nodes, and allows users to sign up and quit at anytime. The algorithm uses a voting system among potential block producers and cryptography techniques to improve algorithm’s efficiency. Similar to PBFT Prepare/ Commit, the use of aggregated signatures reduces the size of voting signature from nodes and therefore reduces the use of bandwidth. It also requires to exchange data twice for a block among all confirmed nodes. In additional to provide a good security, it efficiently improves consensus performance of BFT.**Building a win-win ecosystem base on big data**DBXChain has massive data, also many users and clients as resources for support, which make this program special. Many projects invested by Top Venture Capitals had ecological cooperation with DBX. Thus, DBX Chain is able to merge a large amount of support and resources from these projects, which is absolutely a good starting point.As it shows, the consensus mechanism by DDPoS has a promising future. These well-known resources in China chose DBXChain because they all needed internet that not only had high capacities, but was also highly secure and was able to prevent manipulations and bribery. All these requirements were met by DBXChain. In fact, DBXChain will support many developed businesses, which already has a large volume of data on classical internet. These data will test the capacity of DBXChain internet and its security. It is also why the new consensus mechanism of DDPoS and its public chain can outperform Ethereum and EOS in terms of democratization and security.**DataGame benefits its participants**DataGame is a DApp for crowd-sourcing data collection , where DBX demonstrates capacities and feasibility of its public chain. Every data collector can launch a data collecting game using a certain amount of DBX coins in areas such as AI, purchases and IOTs. Owners of data can get rewards by participating in games. They can also search data needed with high accuracy and pay for a specific amount based upon data size.DataGame has largely lowered prerequisites to participate for data owners, making more valuable and long-tail data available for sharing. Additionally, DataGame has also reduced costs to obtain data so that more users are able to achieve goals and get a brand new experience in data exchange in the blockchain world. As we can see, for DBX to build a new data infrastructure, the first step is to use DataGame.Obviously, the third generation of big data ecosystem will be more common, but this area will eventually become the most competitive among blockchain tycoons. In the face of big rival, we are looking forward to seeing if Ethereum will still be a leader in the public chain competition.;There is no doubt that it is a really good idea and this project will have a successful fund-raising campaign. Wish everything good to developers. P.S. The design of your web-site is nasty. I have spent more than an hour watching this animation#I think it should have been this way, because the project is implementing an unusual technology that its participants will use in the future.
computerscience;9lv6u0;1538824556.0;/r/computerscience/comments/9lv6u0/data_science_vs_big_data/;Data Science vs. Big Data;I am confused as to what these subjects mean exactly. I’ve read some stuff online, and almost each one of them say soemthing different. If I am entering Uni and majoring in Big Data, would that be similar to a Data Science major (I am specifically interested in AI and ML)(also, out of the 3 unis I am applying for, 2 of them have a Big Data major, and only one has a Data Science major). One concern is that I have read that there are a lot of statistics and commerce components involved in Big Data, which kinda makes me think that it might be more of a business related subject.;"Data Science has varying definitions, but generally it means statistics plus some programming. Big Data refers to working with data that is ""too big"" for conventional databases. Think of Twitter data or all credit card transactions. I'm kind of surprised this is a whole major. I've only ever seen it as a course.#You should also look into what classes you’d be taking and the program in general. The data science degree at my school started last year and seems like pretty much a frankenstein major where they just pulled certain CS courses, statistics courses and a few others. At my school I’d say it would make more sense to go with one of three options: CS degree and aim to take all the data science related courses, CS degree with a math minor or math degree with CS minor. #I though big data was a buzzword used in the beginning of the decade, then it evolved into data science, where you could work with large chunks of data to produce ML models. I'm surprised as well there's a whole major for big data.#I want a CS degree, so I am gonna go for that, no doubts about it. If I can’t get a Data Science Major, then I am planning on doing a Cyber Security major, and then doing a shit ton of projects along the lines of Data Science, Machine Learningg and AI#Definitely got hijacked as a buzz word, but it's really about techniques for when the data is too big for memory. This is relative to your amount of memory. In side a router ""big"" data might only be something like a few megs. #Yea CS with a bunch of data science projects is probably a solid call. I’d also make sure you take all the recommended math courses even if they’re not necessarily required.  Like if linear algebra isn’t required for a CS degree at your school that’s a class that you’d definitely want to take at some point. From my experience so far, being able to program is important, but for understanding specific machine learning and deep learning algorithms you’ll want a solid math background.Also for what it’s worth I went to a talk the other day at my school that the director of the data science institute of the University of Virginia gave. He got his doctorate in physical chemistry.  Right now I don’t think there’s really a “best” way to become a data scientist. Having a solid math and statistics background is probably the most important but overall there are a lot of different ways to enter the field so I would keep your options open.#Yeah, in particular it's about databases that are too big for storage in one place, ie a hard drive or single computer. In that case the database must be 'distributed' across multiple nodes (drives, computers etc). Then, the domain of big data is about optimising the design of and operations on a database that is fragmented in this way. How to make sure transactions are atomic and consistent, how to optimise search of such databases, etc etc."

Two months ago I started a new job where my life became a living hell. Some software engineer made the initial investigation for the project and it turns out that the plan he made was not very accurate. It is very tight and now we have to fulfill his plan. Not only that but also the projectr is a fixed time / fixed amount project so we dont have a lot of leeway in the amount of time we can use for our own learning. In my last job I was given a lot of freedom with the time in the first six months because I was new and they gave me time to learn the domain. But in this job they are already asking me when I go a day over my current tasks in the sprint. I am constantly late due to lack of my knowledge and my task estimates are always wrong because I dont really know the existing domain/software. **Thankless guy to ""help"" me**Recently they added a new guy to help me. The guy has 20 years of experience so I thought to myself ""Great, finally I will get some help and this will take some pressure off of me"". Well, this has been totally opposite. The guy literally does not know a lot about the programming language we are using and I have to tell him basic things like why there is an error with the ""precompiled headers"". Yesterday I told him how to add a new class to the project. He is taking a couple of hours away from my day every day. That is all ok but what pisses me off is that  he is thankless and says things in the meetings like ""it takes a couple of hours for me to explain things to him and do basic things like add a project"". This is because I have to do magic things with Jenkins, xml and other infrastructure things to get things ready for that ass. When I started two months ago then no one was there to help me. But I am there to help him with every question he has. They probably planned him as a replacement for me because I was going slow due to lack of domain knowledge and I am a temp employee.**Health**The last few weeks have been terrible for my health. I have high blood pressure for the last three days and I wake up stressed with my remaining tasks. When my girlfriend comes to my house I am thinking about how I can speed up my task or how I will manage the delayed tasks in my meetings.**tl dr**I am tired of my current high pressure/tight deadline/no time to learn domain job and I want to change to an easier position where I can also enjoy my life. I am not looking for a testing job and I am ok with software engineering, management, big data or any other cs career position.  **I dont mind the ""CRUD"" jobs or easy jobs if the pay is good. What are some good alternatives for me? I live in the Netherlands if it matters.**";"Not all software engineering is like this. There are great jobs- both easy and challenging out there.There are terrible jobs out there too- you just stumbled upon one.This is a temp job, you have free healthcare and stuff so just quit and start looking for new jobs at other companies.#You could try working for a large corporation (outside of Big N), they are usually pretty chill and relaxed but the software is usually a little bit more outdated (stable).It sounds like you might be working at a startup if you are dealing with tight budgets, fixed plans, and other stressful things like that. This is why I have recently avoided startups.#update your resume and apply for another job. do not say anything bad about your current employer during interviews. i dont know what you are asking. this is a standard i dont like my job. look for a new job. #this is definitely more about personal issues between you and your coworkersthat being the case, just apply anywhere else. try and 'interview the company' and see if you like the people / team dynamic before joining your next one#What companies would you reccomend?#I am asking for jobs or companies where I will not have this type of stress#What do you mean about personal issues? Can you elaborate please?#Are there any known problems with booking.com? I can forward you an email from a recruiter there if you pm me your email address.#I am not familiar with the Netherlands job market, sorry.#in other words, not a single thing in your post is about the type of work you're doing (R&D). its all about the dysfunctions of your team --- managers not giving you ramp-up time, some new guy you dont like, etcbecause of this, its not necessarily R&D thats a bad fit. its just your team. so when you look for new companies, you dont need some new magical filter (like ""i've heard X jobs are more relaxed than R&D"", or ""CRUD will give me a better life"")just try and make sure whatever new team you join doesnt have the issues that your current one does"

So I satisfied all the requirements, got the recommendation letters and signed up.&#x200B Second last semester.  I don't know shit. I am so confused.;Did work pay for it?#Did you learn computer languages to prepare for your master's? #Yes, partially. Which is the worst part. They are eagerly awaiting that I graduate and start contributing.#I already knew programming. My undergrad was computer science.#At least it saved you some of the financial burden#What is it about your master's that you don't understand? I probably won't understand it either, but I hear it's a desirable degree. If anyone who'd understand it, it would be someone who has a background in CS and programming. #oh boy, until they find out I know shit.#\>  but I hear it's a desirable degree It is kind of. Although a real masters in Stats or Math is where the knowledge is. People thing this data science degree makes you an expert. It does not. It does teach the basics though.\> What is it about your master's that you don't understand?  like how to tackle real problems. Kaggle problems make me go wtf I don't know this...Maybe I should be doing Kaggle kernels to understand. But I am just a fucking lazy ass.&#x200B #Have you been in a situation yet to apply what you learned? You may remember it but not be able to recall if it’s not under the right stimulus.#I googled Kaggle Kernels and fuck if I know. It's one more thing I won't/can't learn. Is it related to Machine Learning? What is Machine Learning? #Not yet. There is a major project due next semester though.  Fucking thing is people think I learning AI or some Google/Facebook level smart shit. Nah player, I am learning basic stat things that economists and social sciences people use. Things like regression, time series, multivariate (I don't understand this one at all), random forests, etc.#It is related to machine learning. Now there is real machine learning, where really smart people have come up with computer programs to predict and explore things. Then there are functions that are some what machine learning.  Example:&#x200B You have a list of 1000 customers. The list has all their details and the amount they spent.  So you use machine learning to figure out what details of the customer matter when it comes to spending money. For example, a customer who is female, between 35-40, married and lives in zip code 33212 is likely to spend $5000. So you come up with a whole list of characteristics and their predicted spending amount. This is called training a model.&#x200B Now you have a new list of 100 potential customers. It has all the details, but since they are not customers, you don't know how much they spend. But you would like to predict how much their will.  You run this list through your model, and out comes a predicted amount for each potential customers.  Based on this, you will say I only want to focus on the customers who will likely spend $5000 or more. Or you could say customers who spend $5000 or more are too high maintenance, I will focus on those who spend $1000 - $3000.&#x200B &#x200B &#x200B &#x200B #Well you’ll certainly be better versed in all of that than coworkers who haven’t taken the classes, no?#It sounds like fun! Or at least the way you describe it. You can do this, dude. #Yes and no. It's like saying a person who has finished two semesters of auto mechanic vocational school knows more about cars than the average person. Now, assume that person got called upon to fix something and everyone is watching... that's how I feel.&#x200B It's not just knowing the basics, it being able to explain and argue the reasoning.

Experienced on small screens that fit in our pockets or fold into our bags, the rich ecosystem that operates behind the scenes is unfathomable in its scale.In some ways, this isn’t at all surprising. After all, more than half of the world’s population is connected to the internet, and everything from social interactions to currencies are finding digital expressions that are as captivating as the real thing.According to a March study by the Pew Research Center, 25% of American adults report that they are online “almost constantly,” and nearly half acknowledge that they access the internet multiple times a day. They are not alone.Worldwide, more than 200 billion emails are sent, five billion Google searches are executed, six billion YouTube videos are viewed. Last Christmas, online shoppingsurpassed in-store purchases for the first time. In total, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created from the flurry of online activity that never ceases.Ultimately, the internet is driven by data. It’s both the outcome and the result of the digital age, and it’s incredibly valuable.In fact, its value is both the thing that makes it problematic and the reality that can make it fixable.At the same time that the internet is experiencing one of its most troubling times in recent memory, the blockchain has arrived as a differentiating technology that utilizes a distributed network and a decentralized ethos to redefine data management in a way that’s effective for our modern, digital ecosystem.https://bluzelle.com;

I think for most IT infrastructure type jobs there’s a lot of communication and service that companies would rather have someone locally for. Also it would be really hard entering into IT and trying to work remotely as you don’t already have the built up skills of people that might be allowed to work remote #While they are out there, I think finding a remote job for one of your first IT jobs is not only extremely rare, but also not the best choice. Simply put you learn so much, and pick up so many things from simply talking to people around in an office setting. Beyond this you get your name and face out there for people to begin to know which can be really helpful for your future career.I think it’s possible you could find a remote job, though very hard, and I wouldn’t recommend it. If you do look though, help desk, technical support and programming jobs all tend to be big winners in terms of finding one that lets you work remote most/all of the time. Goodluck!#Understood, thank you very much for your comment. I will seriously take it in consideration.#This right here. Depending on the type of IT work you want to do, it can be hard enough getting a remote IT job with many years experience. The on site experience you will gain early in your career with be invaluable.#OK, I understand what you say and will think about it. Thank you very much for your time and advice.#I’m just in a junior role myself and getting to know the industry. I’m very appreciative of the company giving me a shot right now so I can learn the skills that can make me super valuable to employers in the future #OK, thanks for the words.

PAX received  regulatory approval from the New York State Department of Financial  Services early in September. Paxos claims that PAX has, “achieved the  fastest, wildest institutional adoption of any digital asset.” So far,  six of the ten largest cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and  OKEx, have listed PAX as a trading pair.  * DocuSign, a San Francisco-based company with over 400,000  customers, announced in a press release this weekend that it would begin  to integrate the Ethereum blockchain into its electronic signature and  transaction management service. DocuSign will offer customers an option  to have evidence of a DocuSign agreement listed on the Ethereum  blockchain. According to Ron Hirson, Chief Product Officer at DocuSign,  the record on the Ethereum blockchain will act as “tamper-proof evidence  for the transaction” that “enables any completed document to be  validated independently.”* Following an announcement yesterday by OKEx that the cryptocurrency  exchange would list 4 stablecoins, Huobi has announced that it would  soon begin listing four US Dollar-pegged stablecoins on its  cryptocurrency exchange. In its announcement, Huobi detailed that it  would list TrustToken’s TUSD, Circle’s USDC, Gemini’s GUSD, and Paxos’  PAX. Huobi Is currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange in  the world by daily trading volume.  * Kenya’s government is planning to leverage blockchain technology to  manage its government housing project responsible for 500,000 units,  according to a report by Kenyan news outlet, Star. The housing project  entails the construction of 500,000 housing units by 2022 and mortage  assistance for Kenyans making less than 100,000 Kenyan Shillings  (USD$992) who cannot afford mortgages. Blockchain technology will be  used in the project to evenly distibute the housing to deserving  participants.  * Notable investor and creator of Galaxy Investment Partners, Mike  Novogratz, has pulled back his forecast for Bitcoin, telling Bloomberg  on Monday that he does not believe Bitcoin will surpass USD$10,000 in  2018. In explaining his forecast, Novogratz said, “I think Q1 \[or\] Q2  \[2019\] if the institutions start coming in, we’ll put in new highs.”  Novogratz happened to be speaking while Fidelity Investments announced  the creation of a new venture, Fidelity Digital Asset Services. In  regards to Fidelity, Novogratz said, “They’ll probably be up and running  in January or Q1.” * Peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading volume levels in Argentina, Venezuela,  and Egypt have hit all-time high levels so far through October 2018. In  Argentina, citizens have flocked to use Bitcoin as a result of the  recent economic crisis in the country -- Argentinian regulators have  even relaxed regulations to allow for more Bitcoin ATMs in the country.  In Venezuela, citizens have been gearing up for the November 5th launch  of the state-backed Petro cryptocurrency, although reports indicate that  there is little pointing to the Petro’s existence in the country.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin transaction volumes in Croatia and Switzerland have  hit 2018 lows.  * Ping An Insurance, one of China’s largest insurers, is pursuing  innovation in blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and cloud  technology. At Ping An Insurance’s Investor Day last week, top Ping  executives delivered presentations and analyses of Ping’s business in  relation to the innovative technologies. Chief Finance Officer, Jason  Yao, said at the event, “We will further improve the strategy of Finance  and Technology and pursue Finance and Ecosystem. By leveraging five key  technologies, namely AI, blockchain, cloud, big data, and security, we  will keep improving efficiency, lowering costs, optimizing user  experience, and strengthening risk control, to enhance competitiveness.”   * While speaking at the Institutional Crypto: Laying the Foundation  conference in New York City hosted by Bloomberg, Gary Gensler, former  chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said that most  cryptocurrencies sold through initial coin offering (ICO) should be  classified as securities. Gensler went on to say, “I think  cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin need more protection, and probably more  protection than even the oil markets.” When asked about blockchain  technology, Gensler replied, “we should be technology-neutral.”**Sources:**r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/paxos-says-it-has-issued-50-mln-of-recently-launched-dollar-backed-stablecoin    r/https://www.coindesk.com/paxos-claims-50-million-in-price-stable-cryptocurrency-issued-in-first-weeks/    r/https://www.ccn.com/docusign-will-add-ethereum-blockchain-integration-to-verify-signatures/    r/https://www.docusign.com/blog/follow-docusign-fall-18-release/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=Blog_Fall18Release    r/https://bitcoinist.com/argentina-venezuela-and-egypt-post-record-p2p-bitcoin-trading-volumes/    r/https://www.coindesk.com/another-top-10-crypto-exchange-is-adding-4-stablecoins-this-week/    r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/kenyan-govt-to-use-blockchain-in-new-affordable-housing-project    r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/mike-novogratz-institutions-will-get-into-bitcoin-in-q1-q2-2019-bringing-new-highs    r/https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/10/16/novogratz-bitcoin-will-breakout-in-2019-but-institutions-still-want-crypto/    r/https://coinjournal.net/chinese-insurance-giant-ping-an-bets-on-blockchain-ai-cloud-in-fintech-push/    r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-cftc-chairman-gary-gensler-icos-should-be-considered-securities    r/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/most-tokens-from-icos-are-securities-former-cftc-head-says ;Great summary of news!#**Bitcoin (BTC) Basic Info:** [Website](https://bitcoin.org) - r/Bitcoin - [Abstract](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_short_description) - [History](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_history) - [Exchanges](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_exchanges) - [Wallets](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_wallets) **Biases:** [Arguments For](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_pros) & [Arguments Against](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_cons) | **CryptoWikis:** [Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/policy#wiki_cryptowikis_program_-_.28work_in_progress.29) - [Contribute Content](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/contributing)---*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

CryptoCurrency;9mtz0q;1539125767.0;/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9mtz0q/reminder_to_remind_others_that_decentralisation/;Reminder to remind others that decentralisation is cryptos biggest asset!;"China is almost a cashless society. This evolution has come in the years where crypto has existed... however has failed dominate.The boom in cashless mobile payments has come from commercial apps such as Wechat and Alipay.From 2013-2016 mobile payment transactions increased from 3 billion to 97 billion a year. The startling thing is how little your end chinese consumer actually cares about transaction fees or data harvesting. The charge is on the merchant side so the consumer doesn't care and fees are cheap enough so the merchants don't really care. One way these apps can make money is through harvesting ""big data"". They record and keep records of every transaction. Information that can be passed on to and state controlled.Facebook's is reportedly struggling to monetize Whatsapp, they have already trialling mobile payments in India. Whatsapp has 1.5bn monthly users.. if it does roll out a payment network it will be the Wechat and Alipay of the West.When spreading the word of crypto I always try ensure that **decentralisation** is the biggest takeaway message.That's one quality that many companies and goverments are always going to struggle to fully achieve  :)";"""Decentralisation""  You mean Monero? Sorry but there really aren't to many options when it comes to decentralisation and crypto.#Tell your friends XRP is the future! #Every crypto that isn't centrally governed or controlled is pretty much decentralised.. and there's many of themMonero is a privacy coin that is also decentralised and yes there aren't many decentralised privacy cryptos.. but there are many decentralised cryptos.#Dogecoin is underrated. The ETH network is fairly decentralized. XMR is king, yes. BTS has been running for years now and I think there has never been a problem. It's a grayscale with trade-offs. #Ravencoin is open source and decentralized with no masternodes, no premine, and no ico.#Digibyte also no ICO  #XRP is centralised. #its not tho    Ripple and XRP are separate but honestly even if they weren't im all in for centralized payment systems  "

YouTube Music is literally the best music streaming app or service I have ever used.;"The service is kind of pricey if you're only interested in the music streaming, but I think the addition of YT Red really pays for itself if you are a frequent YouTube user, which I am.But for me, personally... honestly, the music suggestions are literally the best of any service I have ever used. It uses the YouTube suggestion engine, and in my opinion the ""Your mixtape"" and ""offline mixtape"" features are literally worth the premium by themselves.Your Mixtape is a personalized infinite playlist for online streaming, and it is wonderful. I suspect there is some deep AI involvement in the superb suggestions list. I receive some of the best songs of all time for me flowing one after the other, which is all I really *want*. The other generated playlists are also superb by the way.But in my opinion, the REAL moneymaker here is the Offline Mixtape feature. This feature periodically auto-updates and downloads a ""mixtape"" for you to listen to next time you lose access to the internet. You can set it to download up to 100 songs automatically. I would generally recommend setting it to WiFi-only downloads to save data.That said, I just got off a frustrating day of air travel and at each layover, the app generated and downloaded a new mixtape, which I exhausted on the next leg of the journey. Short version: it is a killer feature and sells the subscription by itself. I literally found the feature by accident this morning and I'm already in love.This is the finest display of Google's big data strategy I have seen so far. Nobody has time to sit down and make playlists unless it's for a special occasion. This is exactly the problem that AI is perfect for solving.";"No thanks. They have a better service in GPM that they did absolutely nothing with and will eventually shut down. #Nice try, Google marketing employee.#Nice ad#Tried Deezer, Spotify, Tidal, and GPM in the past year. Spotify wins imo#This definitely doesn't read like an ad... #I tried it for a bit. While it was good it still wasn't great. I still think they need to tweak the UI and add some animations in certain places. Also fustrating that while in the app you actually have to press next or back buttons for the next song, I'd much rather swipe because it seems more intuitive. Still don't have my Google Play Music Playlists and all the songs I had purchased the GPM. Suggestions are good but can be better. I'd like the ability to disable YouTube likes from my Playlists because sometimes I'll like a YouTube video that isn't even really a song and it will mess with what I actually like and show up in reccomended or randomly show up in my playlist which o constantly have to skip over. Their are more things but I just can't remember off the top of my head since I ready want back to Spotify.  #Until it's integrated with Play Music it's a hard pass.#Soundtrack for your life, brought to you by Google.Bob Dylan said ""You've got to serve somebody"" Modern equivalent is that you have to subscribe somethings.Wife has us on Deezer. #Sorry, the constant nagging from Google have killed this product for me.

In which we pretty much learn to desig for everything interactive. From websites to Cyber Physical Systems.Now I've dived a lot in front end, especially writing html, css & JavaScript. Because I like it, and judging by all the job applications, knowledge in both design & development is usually taken well.However, now I also get the chance to do my minor in Data Science. Here we'll learn to use big data, making the applications much stronger. However, I do need to start gettinf knowledge in working with Python and R.This minor is worth 30 ECT. So that's about 800 study hours. Do you think knowing how to handle big data will be useful in front end? Since python is mainly backend.https://www.kiesopmaat.nl/modules/hro/CMI/139153/That's the minor. ;"My boss said I didn't even need a degree to get my job. They hired an English major right along side of me. No one I work with has a degree in CS either. Unless you're going to be going into a field that will require a CS degree (which, none come to mind), it's not going to be useful in my experience#Sounds kind of backwards to me. Knowing front-end is useful for data science, because part of data science is sharing your results using data visualizations, but data science is not useful for learning front-end. #[deleted]#Depends very much on the country to. In the Netherlands a degree is expected, since there is practically no excuse not to have one here.&#x200B But that doesn't really matter though. I'm already in it. #I'm talking about ""Big Data"" though. That can pretty much be used to make websites much much more stronger. Or well, make anything much much stronger. If you design for conversion for example, that goal is much much stronger with big data to back it up.#I don't like the visual design aspect.I'm more into the last stages of design. Prototype testing, A/B, optimization of the interaction. You can pretty much predict a lot about your users. #Let me start over by restating your question:Is it useful to learn data science as front-end? Answer: no, because data science is tool for analyzing data, and your question is like asking if an airplane is useful for painting a house.  / If you design for conversion for example, that goal is much much stronger with big data to back it up.Conversion from what to what, and how would big data back it up?

Do you even know what the words you're saying mean?Seems like you're the one who's not entirely getting it... But maybe I'm not being very clear.Take Wallmart for example.  They collect more than 2.5 petabytes of data every hour from customer transactions alone.So using that data for conversion: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion\_marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_marketing)Get it?#Your question as phrased in the title suggests that you would like to use data science techniques in order to create a UI.It now seems that that wasn't intention, and what I believe you're asking is if visitor behavior in the UI can be analyzed using data science to improve conversion, which is something that is already being done.  see [this paper](http://psych.nyu.edu/freemanlab/pubs/2014HehmanGPIR.pdf) for an example #**Conversion marketing**In electronic commerce, conversion marketing is marketing with the intention of increasing conversions--that is, site visitors who are paying customers.  The process of improving the conversion rate is called conversion rate optimization. However, different sites may consider a ""conversion"" to be a result other than a sale.

As soon as it fits into RAM (and really, 1 or 2TB of RAM is cheap compare to alternatives) - problem solved. This is super-local solution. &#x200B Local solution if you could fit your multiple servers and data racks in one room. This is another level of locality, which greatly simplifies dealing with data. You only need egress traffic to serve results, basically (and, of course for some sync/replication stuff, but this is trivial), ingress stays right here, could even buy special interconnects&#x200B When you're non-local, this is when real problems begin.

Now the problem here is that only the combinations (56.130651   1.0027225) and (220.04477999999997 -0.29398463) are correct and I am having trouble picking out only those combos.I am sorry for the big data dump but if anybody can help me, I would be very grateful :) ";Can you explain what you are trying to achieve?#I’m on mobile and not in a spot to try this example, but you should be able to just read in the .csv in your first function, pd.read_csv. As in, if isn’t necessary to parse through each line after you call the read_csv function. If maintaining the type is a concern, try df[‘ra’] = df[‘ra’].astype(str). Then it looks like you want to maybe later call the series in a variable? You can just do variable = df[‘ra’]. This list and not call to the dataframe should let you do your looping to print out in the format you are looking for.#Sure, ra and dec are the right ascension and declination (like coordinates) of objects like stars or galaxies in the Sloan digital sky survey (SDSS). With the rest of the code, not shown above, I am using selenium and pyperclip to copy and paste the ra/dec combos which I have taken from a pandas dataframe (with the code above) into a text entry box on the sdss website which, when a button is pressed via selenium, returns images for each object corresponding to the ra and dec combinations entered. Hope that helps explain some background :) #I will certainly give that a go, thank you for your reply! #Aha... so the csv file contains the different ra-dec combo's, one line per ra-dec combo?The dataframe resulting from reading that csv will be exactly the same structure: one row per ra-dec combo. Check it by doing a df.head() after reading the csv...#Yeah that's right, ra and dec are in adjacent columns in the data frame but there are 39 other columns. df.head does just return the top 5 rows of the data frame, as normal#And I think itertuples (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/basics.html#itertuples) is probably the thing you're looking for...#Ok, so the point in the dataframe you also got one row per ra-dec combo... so you simply loop through the rows (check out the pandas docs) and for each row pick out the ra and dec value from that rowWhat you did in your code was loop through all values in the ra column, and for each of those loop through all values in the dec column#Thank you very much for your detailed help! I will certainly be giving that a go later on, hopefully it will save me some time down the line. If not, it's still an interesting automation! Thanks again.#It's more than an interesting automation, if I understand you correctly, it is what you want to do 😇#Right, so update: Your suggestion worked really rather well and, after some tinkering with file I/O and pyperclip, I was able to parse the ra and dec combinations through selenium perfectly. Thank you so much! #Glad it helped you to get things done.
benshapiro;9o88e4;1539566161.0;/r/benshapiro/comments/9o88e4/im_100_certain_i_could_beat_ben_shaprio_in_a/;I'm 100% certain I could beat Ben Shaprio in a debate about our Criminal Justice system;"After listening to some videos of Ben Shapiro talking about the United States Criminal Justice system, I am honestly surprised how vapid his arguments really are when anyone with beyond a college degree thinks about it. To premise my counter-argument, I am referring to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkQUej3v3Qs) video when Ben was speaking at Northwestern University and was asked a question regarding the war on drugs/incarceration, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETcGHOeXgJU) video where Ben discusses some criminal justice/criminology related topics and related crime statistics. Below are my key conclusions.##**Ben's main argument is a culture-of-violence argument.** Ben is regurgitating the Oscar Lewis [*culture of poverty*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Lewis) argument. This argument states that there is a subculture in the population, typically poor minority communities, that internalizes bad moral values and teaches its members to subsist on handouts from the government, promotes laziness, instigate violence or crime, resulting in disorganization and overall malicious behavior from individuals in this group. Hence, these are ""thugs"" and if they simply stopped committing crime all of their problems would go away.However, Ben *ignores* the vast scholarly evidence of sociology, particularly Emile Durkheim and later the tradition of ""Chicago School of Sociology"". [Emile Durkheim](http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/dl.html) gave us the idea of mechanical vs organic society, which is a natural transition that all groups and societies experience when all groups of people integrate and the collective conscience governing morality is re-established. This broad idea ties into another book called [*Black Metropolis.*](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Metropolis-Study-Negro-Northern/dp/0226162346) Due to the very palpable and enduring realities of slavery and the Jim Crow era that followed the civil war, this mechanical/organic transition was stifled for African Americans unlike that of earlier Catholic immigrants such as the Irish or Polish. Unlike these white immigrants, African Americans experienced long-lasting discrimination and forced concentration into specific neighborhoods, which seriously deprived their economic employment opportunities in the division of labor because of things like the lack of limited wealth or skill accrual and structural racism which prevented blacks from transitioning into organic society via employment or housing opportunities.The Chicago school describes the unique historical process & ecological growth of cities and communities. How is the unique growth of cities impacted by the story & successions of African Americans? It ties directly into critiquing sub-culture theory & social disorganization theory. When Ben says races (particularly blacks) develop their own subculture of values, morals, and behaviors, he is ignoring all of the academic evidence on social disorganization theory & misrepresenting the statistics we use to measure crime. Ben ignores all of this in favor of simplistic arguments regarding statistics and big data. [Andrew Abbott](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580667) mentions the danger of simply using “big data statistics” to understand the complexity of our history as a country. Kalil Gibran Muhammad has another excellent [book](https://www.amazon.com/Condemnation-Blackness-Making-Modern-America/dp/0674062116) explaining of how we interpret crime statistics matters. This was echoed in [*The Philadelphia Negro*](https://www.amazon.com/Philadelphia-Negro-Social-Study/dp/0812215737) by W.E.B. Dubois and his documentation of early historical accounts where social scientists tried to justify black criminality or inferiority with statistics. This was done to justify racial inequality in areas of crime rates, literacy, and poverty. Finally, Harvard sociologists Robert Sampson and William Julius Wilson just came out with the [reassessment](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/reassessing-toward-a-theory-of-race-crime-and-urban-inequality/68C99328C0574E23D1CBC6FDFD60BED9) to their famous 1995 article *Toward a theory of race, crime, and urban inequality""*, which I think does the best job of dismantling Ben Shapiro's entire argument. If he would debate me on just that article alone I think I would win. There is no way that Ben would bother reading that article anyway because his overall sub-culture argument would instantly fall apart. Other small corrections I would make against Ben is his plea bargains quote, which Ben does bring up but does not elaborate on by saying that many of these individuals are actually innocent due to our out of control criminal justice system and lack of indigent public counsel. Another issue I had is the false-equivalence Ben uses between crack and crystal meth to make a false-argument regarding discrimination in drug sentencing. Crystal Meth and Crack are two entirely different drugs, Ben should have compared crack to cocaine and the characteristics of those individuals arrested for possession. This is because cocaine is seen as a wealthy white drug versus crack being seen as a poor minority drug. This is key when understanding disparities in drug sentencing between blacks and whites and their representation in the criminal justice system.In sum, I just hate how Ben Shapiro will only debate college students who know nothing about a topic and who are by definition (you go to university to learn) ill-equipped to tackle Ben's fallacious points. Debate one of the living professors that I mentioned and let's see how fast facts care about Ben's feelings.   ";Tweet at him. Pretty sure he has yet to turn down a debate#I wish to point out that he actually had his mind changed regarding weed as he recently mentioned at one of his university talks Thus I would not be surprised if you could change his mind on this topic My suggestion to you is that you research “Restorative Justice” it is possibly the best solution to the massive criminal justice problem in America http://restorativejustice.org/restorative-justice/about-restorative-justice/tutorial-intro-to-restorative-justice/TL DRRestorative justice is a theory of justice that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminal behaviour. It is best accomplished through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders. This can lead to transformation of people, relationships and communities.#I appreciate how well-thought this post is. Make a serious effort to contact him, and let us know what he says. His email is:bshapiro@dailywire.com#I’m pretty sure he’s willing to debate professors but none are willing. He’s been questioned by a few at his speeches and fares pretty well considering the professors came prepared knowing the question ahead of time while Ben did not. #This sounds like a very interesting debate and I hope you contact Ben to make this real#You really should try to get in touch with him. Would be interesting to see/listen to a debate like this.#Does he debate on his podcast?#No I don’t believe he does#I don't have a twitter #If you decide to make one or email him or whatever, let us know. This could be an interesting conversation #You could send him an email! I’d be really interested to see this debate. You make some good points.#Ignoring my privacy concerns of having this be a public debate, I'm currently a graduate student who has bills to pay and comp exams to study for, so setting up a debate isn't really on my agenda right now. Maybe when I complete my degree and have some free time I will message him. My other suggestion still stands. I think Ben should have someone like Khalil Gibran Muhammad on his podcast, or at least read his book and give his thoughts on it. Point is, there are many qualified individuals which Ben could debate on the topic of Criminal Justice. If Ben really wanted to flex his intellectual superiority he would debate an academic instead of undergraduate students.

longevity;9mv6d1;1539135329.0;/r/longevity/comments/9mv6d1/broad_institute_talk_and_trying_to_persuade/;Broad Institute Talk and Trying to Persuade Accomplished People;"I just went to a talk at the Broad Institute on cloud computing, machine learning, and the future of medicine. The speaker is working on a big data project regarding cardiovascular disease. We talked to the speaker afterward about how even if you got rid of cancer or heart disease that the overall human lifespan would only increase very modestly. I asked if he had thought about working on something more upstream like aging and life extension, as in the work of Aubrey or George Church. He said there seem to be a lot of promising things but that it wasn't his area of expertise. Sometimes answers like this can be depressing because it feels like a disconnect between beliefs and action. After posing the following: ""What you're doing isn't that impactful. Wouldn't it be good to consider working on something more impactful?"", it can be disheartening to get lackluster and uncurious responses. This is one reason I respect the philosophy of effective altruism, which makes this question one of the main drivers of the actions it takes. His talk was really fascinating, and it's wonderful that he and his team are doing such imaginative work, but I just hoped for a more engaged response. I'm motivated by the small chance of getting people to do more impactful work in the same way 80,000 Hours is trying to get people to consider or reconsider careers. Influencing others' perspectives when it comes to thinking about the world or solving problems, even in casual conversation with educated and accomplished folks, can sometimes be successful, and the possibility of it keeps me going. What have your experiences been in similar circumstances?";"Pivoting in science seems hard. I'm starting to look at postdoc and industry positions. Many of them want me to have done my doctoral work on the same thing they work on. And if you're a principal investigator in academia, most of the work you do ends up being what you can get a grant for.#You have to have one intellectual accomplishment up your sleeve that intimidates people because now they have to seriously consider the possibility that what you are saying might have some hidden genius behind it they can't immediately see.#IMO, the current research attitude is very heavily influenced by institutional pressures: There's billions of dollars allocated for research on individual diseases, cancer, heart disease, because people know that one of their loved ones died from those causes and thus create advocacy around this. Longevity is vague, aging has not taken the cultural umbrella yet. The FDA does not consider aging a disease, e.g. for metformin and fisetin the aging-related clinical trials all happen in contorted forms after targeted-disease approval or for already-safe compounds. If there is one single politically powerful advocate for this idea in government, even redirecting 1% of federal funds in this direction would be a huge boon.I mostly agree with the ""more impactful"" designation as well. However, in a rationalist mindset you do have to be cautious in being overconfident that your idea or measurement of impact is the right one: And even if it is, you need to find effective, persuasive ways to communicate it as such. The top minds in the overall ""umbrella"" of aging don't all agree on what the best approach is.Some people are skeptical that there are longevity dividends to be reaped, and many are skeptical that the SENS approach is the correct one. Others think that tackling cardiovascular diseases directly will yield a concrete, pure payoff, while aging is vague and unknown still. In all the health-related fields, what is indeed the most impactful? I don't think the best of us have a consensus yet. However, I do think \*way more\* people and money should be betting on the longevity payoff, because there is enough confidence that it's right and payoff if real. I don't think we should expect government to be run on a purely utilitarian, altruistic model either since that's not how people tend to shake out. The Emperor of All Maladies is an amazing book that covers cancer from the very beginning to fights and lobbying of powerful Senators in the mid-century to secure funding to create a War on Cancer.The downstream vs. upstream argument is very interesting. You'd want to calculate the chance that you are ""right"", and then based on that confidence do a particular allocation. Maybe a Kelly Criterion-style bet. Clearly 0% aging research is probably wrong, but so is 90%.#Definitely. The state of academia is really rough for people and it sucks having to play the game. I've read some posts on alternate models for research institutes with way better incentives that seems really interesting but hard to do unless you have hundreds of millions to fund them.[http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2018/09/the-french-way-alain-connes-interview.html](http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2018/09/the-french-way-alain-connes-interview.html)What'd you get your doctorate in?

I agree it's important not to come off as a fringe crackpot.#I very much agree that understanding the incentives of the system(s) is important re: institutional pressures. Rationalists should definitely be mindful of the epistemic status (low-confidence, medium, etc.) of their claims and to be effective in communicating it. I think the rationalists community can fail in that regard with persuading others because their comparative advantage often isn’t usually in the social skills/public persuasion arena. The streetlight effect definitely plays a big part in what research gets done and I understand that often times research isn’t about research ala Robin Hanson: [http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html)That said, even without a consensus, I think there’s lower hanging fruit to finding more impactful strategies vs finding the One Best Health Project. I’m also lamenting people even devoting a reasonable amount of time into \*thinking\* about it and from my understanding, many don’t spend as much time thinking at all about it as would be rational. The same argument is made about spending some time finding good shoes and a good mattress because of how much time you spend in them. Thanks for your thought out reply! Do you work in the field? And what do you think are things that we can do as individuals or groups to reach LEV?  "
sydney;9mcqn0;1538982968.0;/r/sydney/comments/9mcqn0/could_someone_explain_why_nsw_transport_data_are/;Could someone explain why NSW transport data are so unreliable?;"Honestly, in our times of machine learning and big data, how on earth can NSW transport to do so poorly? I can understand that some traffic incidents cannot be forecasted, BUT:A/ Why are some bus lines and times consistently so late? When I say consistently, I mean more than half the time with more than 15min delay, and this is at the beginning of the route!B/ How come some buses still have ""no real time data available"" in the tracking apps? A GPS module, even a rugged industrial one, cost a fraction of a percent of the annual operating cost of a bus.C/ How come some buses a are displayed with apparently ""real time data"" that actually don't exist? Honestly, did they really go as far as developing software to fake non-existing buses?I'd be genuinely interested for some insight by somebody working in there, more particularly for point c/.";"GTFS-Realtime (as a spec) has no way of doing anything you have stated.To point a. - Buses run a range of different routes. They can become late at any point in the route. For example, on Saturday, I was with a friend of mine who was on a 525 in Olympic Park. Dawn Fraser Ave was closed next to ANZ. State Transit were not told. There was a bit of an issue as he found out how to divert. He left Olympic Park Station on time, arrived at Parramatta 12 mins late. It's the small things, you can't always predict them.To point b. - Buses show as 'no real time available' if they either don't exist, or the Opal Readers aren't working. If the latter, the driver has not been able to sign into that running of the route, and therefore it does not exist in the system. To point c. - Buses may show as 'last known location' - this is an implementation within the third-party apps and not something that GTFS-R is able to accurately predict. #Generally, most of the time, the real time data on the Sydney transport network is one of the best. If you go to Melbourne for example, it's really bad and sometimes non-existent. #Honestly?http://imgur.com/gallery/0NQvvjjThe service interruption note mentions ""up to 25 minutes"". Some buses are technically 80 minutes beHind#Mate they can't even get the transport to run on time let alone the data for it#Thanks mate. If I understand well your reply, the ""real time"" in the name of the specdoes not mean real time? Point b. If a bus does not exist, how complicated world it be for transport NSW to update their data for cocks sake ? As for the link between opal and tracking, I believe there is no correlation, I.e.I all fairly sure i have taken several non real time data buses, where the opal readers were working, and the other way around as well. Also, making a bidirectional requirement link between the two would be a stupid design decision. I understand the opal system may need the gps data to know where the bus l, but the gps system should not need the opal system to be up.C. In the the trip view app for instance, it shows bus locations, updated every 20sec or so, for buses that are not ""no real time data available"". So you are telling me even these are not real time either? #so true#> If a bus does not exist, how complicated world it be for transport NSW to update their data for cocks sake ?Because the bus *does* exist, just not as a realtime bus. The bus should still run as scheduled, unless it's been outright cancelled.> I all fairly sure i have taken several non real time data buses, where the opal readers were working, and the other way around as well.There's a list of reasons why, but they all come back to the unit the ticket machine sits on. If that unit fails, you have no opal readers, no GPS and no PTIPS. Ergo, no realtime data. > Also, making a bidirectional requirement link between the two would be a stupid design decision.Opal readers require PTIPS so they know where you are and can charge you the correct fare. GTFS-R requires PTIPS so it knows where the bus is, and how far away it is from X stop. > I understand the opal system may need the gps data to know where the bus l, but the gps system should not need the opal system to be up.GPS == PTIPS. They're linked to each other, and while the operator can see where a bus is with or without PTIPS, for it to show in the apps it needs to be connected to a running ID, which is the job of PTIPS. > In the the trip view app for instance, it shows bus locations, updated every 20sec or so, for buses that are not ""no real time data available"". So you are telling me even these are not real time either? These buses should display as a really dark (almost black) green, and ""Last known location"" or ""Location last updated"" or whatever it says... "

aws;9krli2;1538494075.0;/r/aws/comments/9krli2/cloud_practitioner_vs_solutions_architect_with/;Cloud Practitioner vs Solutions Architect with Big Data end goal;To keep it short, I work as a data engineer and am looking towards getting the AWS Big Data Specialty cert. I have a lot of practical experience with both AWS and Big Data technologies and want to supplement my education (my BS is not in CS). I don't really have any desire to be a solutions architect, so I was wondering if it mattered at all which entry level cert I got if I'm just using it as a stepping stone to the Big Data Specialty.;"although it may cost more, do it for peace of mind and confidence building. although i didn't have much experience with aws, i did the aws cloud practioner to get confidence in ""how not to overspend on AWS."" the solution architect route should than teach me to ""how do i put together generic solutions."" got the cloud practitioner within 2 weeks, will go for associate after 6 weeks of long study#Solutions Architect will be better for you since you're already familiar with AWS. Cloud Practioner is more basic and introductory. You don't necessarily need to want to be a solutions architect to take the certification.#I didn’t realize that Cloud Practitioner allowed you to take the Big Data exam. Just go that route. Maybe go back for SA or SysOps later. But CP is a much easier exam. #I'm in the same boat as you and just passed the Cloud Practitioner.The exam is a joke. I have no idea why it exists, except to bleed money out of people in exactly your situation. The exam should be retired and they should remove the prerequisite for the specialty exams.#Well i only need one of these two to move on to the big data cert, so i think im just going to go with cloud practitioner. I may circle back for solutions architect later, but it just seems with such a high level of change for that cert that it'll expire in 2 years and i'll never touch it again.#True, I'm just looking towards what will get me to the Big Data cert the fastest (need to get it by the end of the year). I think i'll go for the cloud practitioner and circle back for the solutions architect.#Yeah, it says the prerequisite for big data is either CP or an associate level exam so i think that’s the best move.#Yeah, i honestly don't even know if i'll put it on my resume, to be honest#[deleted]#Honestly passing the Cloud Practitioner  exam proves nothing and reflects no knowledge of AWS whatsoever. I wish I hadn't taken it at all and had just gone ahead and failed the Solutions Architect Associate exam. I only took it because it satisfied the prereq for the specialty exams. Having never used AWS it's too frustrating to study a bunch of disparate services and terminology like I'm back in middle school, so I thought myself unprepared for the SA exam and went for the Cloud Practioner. Probably I will find the Solutions Architect exams to be very annoying and broad in comparison to the SysOps and Devops exams. Unfortunately though it seems in industry that the ""Solutions Architect"" label is more prevalent and perhaps the more useful title to have in comparison to the Devops. Of course I could be wrong, that's just my impression.AWS must remove the prerequisites for the specialty exams immediately. Thank you."

When I have a need for an application I click install, 99% of the time they install in less than 30 seconds. Once I'm done, they have served their purpose I remove them. While this may not be everyone's flavour, for me, As someone who works with computers all day every day it's nice to have a simple option. If I need anything else I use an Ubuntu Image. The issues with the deletion of files is a well-publicised issue with the torrent client itself. And something that is easily found with a Google search or looking at the knowledgebase articles. Simple, use FTP or use a remote client and there are no issues. Personally, I have faced no major issues, and Continue to be very satisfied with the product I purchased. I reach the speeds you are referring to in rutorrent with no issues. You may need to refad up on seeding and leaching dynamics within the torrent protocol to understand better before you say speeds are rubbish. While the version of deluge that has been adapted for AppBoxCo has been modified for more streamlined performance and better functionality it also has its flaws, native flaws. Each user has their own preferences, and I still prefer ruTorrent.With a shared disk dynamic, as stated in comments. Thing like checking torrents can take a while. Using common sense, however, to reduce write speeds to allow for faster read speeds would improve your performance. With 400plus torrents downloading I would expect trying to check one is going to face issues. Even on a local machine, my home machine is not a budget build and I still get reduced speeds checking torrents with large numbers of downloading torrents active or seeding. All of the disks are brand new. With the old disks being destroyed with the migration. They are definitely not old or crappy. This has never been hidden information, if I could afford the disks they have I would be over the frickin moon. I don't even want to ask why you need to keep restarting your client. I have needed to restart it once in the last 3 months (other than when an update is performed)As someone who is still very active In I chat I can say that the statement about refusing to acknowledge I/O speed issue is not true. Multiple and still ongoing improvements have been made off of the back of users feedback. There are big things happening. Not every improvement has a face value, not every improvement effects every user, every user has a different experience and need-sets and that's the beauty of the platform. If you need a more heavy duty platform for rapid downloading, rebuilding and upload of torrents, then anyone who knows their stuff will tell you a shared disk is not designed for you. You didn't HAVE TO write this to save the next guy from having a headache. As I would assume the next guy would have purchased the product that suited their needs.I, to this day, am very happy with the service I get, and the admins do an amazing job. Your opinions are your own, and I am not being disrespectful or saying they are wrong, I hope this serves as an alternative and opposite perspective of the services offered by AppBoxCo.#>Great idea how you can install apps like ubuntu with rootI'm not sure you understand what you're talking about.Also, what box did you have?  That would shed a little light on performance issues.  If you had the cheapest offering they have on tap, well fuck yeah you're gonna have a hard way to go about doing pretty much anything.  The same holds true for any vendor of this model.#I tried them for a month as well and their service just shits the bed too much. I get torrents stuck at 99.99% and forced to recheck. Stalled torrents that just stop when there are plenty of peers.  Poor download speeds to US on a 1GB connection. I get 150Mbps on average. I have another seedbox with UltraSeedbox and see 600Mbps+.  #[removed]#Okie doke then.  So if I'm seeing things right, you're comparing a 32.52USD shared offering to a dedicated offering from another vendor on a network that potentially peers far better to anyone else.  So basically ""My other girlfriend fucks better than my new girlfriend"".The thing is, you can't make any comparison to shared disk vs dedicated disk.  The number of users on a server is really secondary, as you've evinced by saying your torrent speeds were good.  When you're dealing with a shared environment the network is almost never the bottleneck.  It's the disk.  This is why I always get a dedicated disk when I'm gonna be working with a shared situation.#I'm not nitpicking, but Ubuntu root is most definitely not an app.  Ubuntu is a flavor of an operating system, root is the level of privilege you have on that operating system.#[removed]#[removed]#Their ""apps"" are basically just docker containers from what I see.One of them is ""Ubuntu"".#What's not sold what way?  Do you mean that SeedboxCo doesn't advertise that their offerings are shared?  Because they most certainly do.#I've used their service for a month.  It worked just fine and as advertised for me.  Shared servers are kind of a crap shoot, especially when there is unmetered bandwidth on offer and they also allow public trackers."

Then docker/docker-compose became a thing. It was a mess to install+maintain. There were no/old versions of it in the official repo/pecl.

There were also no automatic atom/vscode editor updates.Is it all better now?#I mean that it is not like.

Found it in the aur, gives me on error during the installation and doesn't work now. Not the start I wanted.#Well for me it is quite stable but I'm not working with docker and vscode nor atom. They are leading edge and you definitely realise that because there are always a ton of updates, but they are not bleeding edge and you also realise that because it is quite stable and never broke for me. Admittedly I'm using as much flatpaks a I can and therefore have not that much dependency's that can break.#I've used both docker and docker-compose on a Fedora server. They both worked wonderfully out of the box providing you either configure SELinux properly or disable it. (not all setups are the same, yours may work fine with it enabled)#Most distros don't include vscode in their repos. If Solus has it in their repos, it must be the pure OSS version. Not that there should be any significant difference between the version distributed by Microsoft and the pure OSS version if it's packaged with the same [related parts](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects). If Solus doesn't package the pure OSS version, I don't think that's legal.#They do, you use it with code-oss in the terminal.

The power of Facebook comes from from two aspects: highly amounts on personal data and also from large audiences (user engagement). Facebook needs both, one to better target you specific ads (waste less money of advertising companies) and large audiences to target ads to most people possible (bigger catalog). If the user engagement decrease (via people leaving the platform) the value of advertisement campaigns also decreases. This means that advertising will send less money for Facebook to fight for you attention - the real Facebook product. Remember that 98% of revenue of Facebook comes from ads.

The other thing I would do is try to maximize your money to it's fullest potential at your age.  You should try to save something even if its only $100 a check.  What you can do to help start grow your money is get a credit card that has good cash back.  Use that credit card for everything you purchase, and stop using cash.  This way you are maximizing your free cash back.  Open up a savings account with a bank that offers a high rate, like Ally for example has 1.85%.  Dump your cash back and any money you save from your pay into that account and start making some interest on it.  Try to do your best to maximize your money even if it is only a small amount.  Always remember, if someone was going to offer you $1 a day, every day, for free, would you take it?

I'm only 27 and have been working post college for 4 years now, so I'm still in that saving phase and trying to establish myself.  I sat down one day to find out how every angle to maximize my money, while having it still be accessible to me, and at low risk.  I literally have worked everything down to the smallest detail.  I purchase everything on my credit card, so that I maximize my cash back potential (free cash).  Then, I made a budget so that generally my credit card bill each month is going to be the same.  This allows me to know how much money I need to have in my checking account prior to my credit card bill being do.  So in turn, I can put majority of my paycheck into my Ally savings where I make more interest than if it sat in my checking account with Chase.  Then on top of this, a bulk of my savings is with Ally 11 Month no Penalty CD where I make 2.1% and can take it out anytime after 6 days of funding.  Once the rate goes up, I close it, then reopen it again.  Also, once my credit card points get me to $100, I cash that out and dump it into my Ally Savings because now I'm making free money on free money!  This seems like a lot to manage, but once you setup a budget, it is so easy to manage.  My friends think it's a waste of time to close a CD and re-open it to get .1% more but I always say to them the thing I ended my last post with regarding a free dollar a day.  Then it makes sense to them haha.

You just don’t have control of it while in that mode short of steering wheel controls.

This Traverse is a low end (LS) without many bells and whistles. No steering wheel controls, no Bose system, etc., so the built-in FM antenna might not even have a SiriusXM antenna.

But everyone keeps talking about big data, iiot, iot, analytics and blockchain..I dont find any of that topics interesting besides artificial inteligence.Should i focus only on what do i have interest in? Or should i study the new coming techonlogies like it or not? I have some basic knowledge on everything;Big data, IoT, blockchain, AI, etc. have become buzzwords. Of course the amount of data stored in databases is growing everyday, more and more devices are being connected to the internet, and the research on AI, especially in the context of neural networks will probably go on for quite some time. However you shouldn't decide on what to do in your life depending on what is 'hot' right now. In my opinion you should always try to do what you enjoy doing and what you are interested in.May I know which topics you find particularly interesting? :)#It's easier for us to learn the things we like. And the good news for you that the 3 things that will be highly developed in the future are 1) Big Data Analytics, 2) AI and others I forget.&#x200B You have to keep learning about AI, this is a very good thing and even better because you like it.#I'm not really into those topics either so I feel in the same boat sometimes.  They seem too business-y for me.  Keep in mind some people are more interested in the financial aspect of CS in college or think focusing on current buzzwords looks better for them. Keep learning about the topics you like because AI and low level programming and such are always gonna be valuable moving forward.  #I'm sick of buzzwords everywhere. #I do find neural networks and AI in general interesting. Also i do like graphics, im working on my own graphics engine as a side project. Low level programming is entertaining in general, also game development. Im getting more experience in web and mobile development too, as i came from a desktop background.I think i would need to see some kind of list, as i cant really come with specific topics. Maybe i need to expand my knowledge of what fields do exist? #Bruh, tell me about it.. #You could start by finding out which courses your college offers.Have you every done anything with an Arduino or an ESP8266?#Im currently starting my final project. I will use an Arduino to make some kind of Electronic control system for motorcycles.I've done some PIC programming when i was young, out of pure curiosity

scala;9l9xlp;1538640432.0;/r/scala/comments/9l9xlp/question_how_long_would_it_take_to_be_confident/;[Question] - How long would it take to be confident using SCALA? - given that I have no programming experience at all!;[deleted];Very curious situation. How do you go from never programmed anything -> getting asked to code full time in scala? Would your job be a full time programmer, or would you manage a spark project? I can imagine that to manage a big data project properly you might want to learn something about the technologies used, but I doubt you would have to actually learn programming. If your job is actually to program full time id say, considering no programming experience, a year or two to be a proficient programmer (in any language you pick). Learning the language is not the hard part, a programmer can learn a new language in a few weeks or months. What will be the major roadblock for you is all the general programming skills and just applying programming in general to solve problems, and thats whats important. #I've seen people do 4-year CS degrees and fail to learn how to program  I've seen people pick up enough to work with and the habit of learning more in a couple of weeks (not to say that you'd memorize the whole language/framework/... in that time, but you'd be able to write programs that worked and look up new things as you needed them). I've seen a study that gave people a simple programming test at the start and end of a programming course and got the same results each time, and argued that students either understood the concepts immediately or not at all. I appreciate that this isn't a terribly useful answer for basing a decision on, but I fear it may be the reality.#[deleted]#Would you be learning full time? It's hard to ballpark if we don't know how much time you're spending learning.#Yes, I believe so. It has something to do with Spark. The project in itself is automating some big data tasks (not much info)#Thank you for your answer! Yes, would be full time (roughly 40 weekly hours).#[deleted]#If you just want to get some stuff done in Spark, have you considered Python? Python is a much easier language to learn for a non programmer. In addition, if you're using the Dataframes API, there will be little to no performance impact (unless you start using UDFs and UDAFs written in Python). #> but Scala is never the recommended first programming language for someone to learn programmingAs a teacher, I would totally use it as a first language.  The basic syntax is quite simple and similar to what you learn in math class. Sure you have denote the parameter types, but that is reasonable because in programming we have more stuff besides numbers.    def f(x: Double) = 2*x + 4Once you understand the colon notation, you have already learned some UML. You can create a class in one line with equality as you would expect it. And you can ease into OOP by starting with `object` than abstracting that into `class`, when you find commonalities between objects. That's the bottom up approach a course should use. You can also use various classes before you know what they are, like `List(1,2,3)`.So yeah, I think Scala is top notch as a first language.#Well prof. Mark C. Lewis at Trinity University used Scala to teach CS1 and CS2 courses, and published several books about that...

Two months ago I started a new job where my life became a living hell. Some software engineer made the initial investigation for the project and it turns out that the plan he made was not very accurate. It is very tight and now we have to fulfill his plan. Not only that but also the projectr is a fixed time / fixed amount project so we dont have a lot of leeway in the amount of time we can use for our own learning. In my last job I was given a lot of freedom with the time in the first six months because I was new and they gave me time to learn the domain. But in this job they are already asking me when I go a day over my current tasks in the sprint. I am constantly late due to lack of my knowledge and my task estimates are always wrong because I dont really know the existing domain/software. **Thankless guy to ""help"" me**Recently they added a new guy to help me. The guy has 20 years of experience so I thought to myself ""Great, finally I will get some help and this will take some pressure off of me"". Well, this has been totally opposite. The guy literally does not know a lot about the programming language we are using and I have to tell him basic things like why there is an error with the ""precompiled headers"". Yesterday I told him how to add a new class to the project. He is taking a couple of hours away from my day every day. That is all ok but what pisses me off is that  he is thankless and says things in the meetings like ""it takes a couple of hours for me to explain things to him and do basic things like add a project"". This is because I have to do magic things with Jenkins, xml and other infrastructure things to get things ready for that ass. When I started two months ago then no one was there to help me. But I am there to help him with every question he has. They probably planned him as a replacement for me because I was going slow due to lack of domain knowledge and I am a temp employee.**Health**The last few weeks have been terrible for my health. I have high blood pressure for the last three days and I wake up stressed with my remaining tasks. When my girlfriend comes to my house I am thinking about how I can speed up my task or how I will manage the delayed tasks in my meetings.**tl dr**I am tired of my current high pressure/tight deadline/no time to learn domain job and I want to change to an easier position where I can also enjoy my life. I am not looking for a testing job and I am ok with software engineering, management, big data or any other cs career position.  **I dont mind the ""CRUD"" jobs or easy jobs if the pay is good.

Performance is important, particularly when one of the models may have an update frequency of around 1 - 3s perhaps.;"You don't need an NVMe ssd for games. The difference is negligible.

For a PSU I went with the Corsair H1200i ... there's some crazy PSU sales going on and I'd recommend going above 850 as that what I swapped from an EVGA T2 850. Power delivery is more consistent between 40-60% in my understanding. If money is no object I'd go 2080ti. I already had a 1080ti Seahawk X IE Watercooled thus didn't need to spend on a GPU. The 2080ti would give you the FPS back that you lose by going Ryzen over Intel.#Don't go with an AIO that isn't specifically designed to cover 100% of the IHS - many reviews online have shown that tower-style air coolers like the Noctua NH-U14s, Cooler Master Wraith Ripper, and DeepCool's Fryzen cool better than most AIOs without the Threadripper's rectangular coldplate design.  You don't have many good options for AIO with TR, to be fair, but your current choice isn't going to be anywhere near the best for what you're going to pay for it, and push/pull on a rad so thin probably isn't worth it either and will have, at best, negligibly-better performance on cooling the CPU (although it might provide better airflow inside the case if you mount the RAD in front as intake).  Since you're looking at a large ATX case, you will probably be better served with a TR4-specific AIO if you truly do want to go that route, but you can probably save $ and go with a (good) tower air cooler and do just as well.See for yourself:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FffaOYQpI6k#Well the only reason I selected it is because its random read/write is much better (relatively) than the 860 EVO Sata, which I thought did matter in games?#It won't matter :P#It matters for load times, but negligibly.

Swapping back to 1TB 860 EVO I originally had thought of.#Agreed - I go with NVMe SATA drives for the lack of cables and to use smaller case designs, but the performance is on par with the SATA variants and SATA drives are cheaper at the same capacity.Yes, I'm paying the ITX tax, but it's my choice.  You certainly won't get more performance in an NVMe SATA drive, and you'll pay more, so only do that if you have a reason to.  I'm not sure my desire to only use ITX systems is a ""good"" reason, to be fair, but it's a reason..."

Most of the time I didn't have to consider Big Data. Example problems I would solve are things like detecting topics in a corpus of text or determining sentiment and things like that. I worked with Python and would use the library Spacy a lot rather than NLTK, this does a lot of the tokenization and stemming work for you, you can detect sentence structures with POS tags and entity detection. Learn Spacy and also look at word2vec with the gensim library. That should be a good starting point that will be relevant to most jobs in text analysis. Try simple tasks like topic extraction, also be aware of differences in language and how to make analysis language agnostic.There are loads of jobs in NLP, it's so useful in so many areas. You should be able to find plenty of work if you can demonstrate knowledge with a few examples on github or a blog or something #Cool thanks. Yea I'll be interested in analyzing comments.

Thanks for sharing, it really helps. I'm planning to start a new project involving topic extraction, so I'll see how it goes.#You don't need a data science certificate. I've never come across a time where any kind of certification would have been particularly beneficial in my 10 years in the industry.

Didn’t say the name out loud, didn’t have it written on my phone’s shopping list, didn’t use my loyalty points card. Just paid by debit card and left. A few hours later, I see an ad for the same brand’s conditioner on my instagram app. It’s spooked me out a little! Is this is coincidence or is it big data at play? I don’t understand how the advertiser even knew that I bought that brand. ;"Card purchase histories are now for sale.  It's not impossible for FB/IG to buy them to ... ""better serve you ads.""https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/31/google-and-mastercard-reportedly-partner-to-track-offline-purchases/#[deleted]#I get sms ads *from my carrier* for things like gym memberships, clothing sales, or movies when I'm anywhere near businesses like that.It's so fucking invasive.#Have you bought this kind of shampoo before? Do you allow Instagram to have access to your location? Did you buy anything else?My first bet is that they used instagram's analytics to profile you. Read this article about target:https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#66ad1ae66668In it, it describes how target's analytics are so good that they could determine that a girl was pregnant and knew which items she would statistically like to buy based on data they had on her despite not telling anyone of her pregnancy. Most people aren't unique and you might fit into a category of specific people who actively use that product.  If you are taking pictures of yourself, and chatting with friends, and using an email account across multiple social media sites, it wouldn't be hard to build a consumer profile. If your friends buy a product, they might try to push ads to you for the peer pressure effect. It is possible that your debit provider is selling your data, but I kind of doubt that it would correlate that fast to specifically only your Instagram account. #My Bluetooth was on. Thanks for your response!#Good to know. I didn't know about this one, though I know they do the same thing with WiFi frames and high pitched sounds and daemons in apps. #Haven’t used this kind of shampoo before but Instagram location was on. On a related note, if people were to turn location services off for a particular app, is there a way to check if that app still taps into location?#Good question. First, you need to know that apps can track you through GPS, WiFi, and apparently Bluetooth. If location is enabled on your camera, photos have that info in the metadata. If the app has access to network connections, you can rest assured that they are pulling your known WiFi hotspots from your phone. The name of your home router is probably unique enough that it can be looked up in wigle database. There are more techniques, but pretty much be assured that if your phone has location services enabled, you are being tracked. There is a setting in the iPhone that allows you to see an arrow on the top bar of your phone next to the time. If you ever see the arrow, some app is accessing it. I don't know if you can see if a specific app has asked though.  If you are using android, in the settings and under apps, you can see all of the times an app has requested a given permission. "

We have had enough problems with our firewalls even without a huge proxy farm running on it as well.What are your opinions?1 - One big firewall which handles everything (Firewalling, Proxy, IPs, Application Control, VPN, ...)or2 - a slightly smaller box and dedicated services (the classical approach).or3 - Or maybe something between, e.g. IPS as blade, but dedicated proxy farm.​thanks,max;Firewall which only performs basic firewalling functions + Zscaler / Cloud Security. This also eliminates the need of back hauling and you can use something inexpensive like SRX300 if you’ve got a lot of branches as a router which connects to your central security platform.You can also directly let end users connect to it who are outside your network, so we found this more flexible and scalable than a huge central security stack.#pfSense, but would run multiple installs to break up the rules as needed.#I would go 2 or 3.Or 4 : firewall on prem + proxy SaaS#Help me understand your proxy farm.. are these subscribers that get their own environment and you need to segment? #This. Currently moving from Bluecoat + Sourcefire/ASA for URL filtering, firewall and IDS. Dropping the Bluecoats and the URL filtering on the sourcefires. Moving to Zscaler for proxy/content filter plus ASA/Sourcefire for firewall IDS.&#x200B Zscaler is so much easier to deal with blocking or allowing applications granularity wise.  #Our proxy farm is basically a huge shared forward proxy, statically configured in all the browsers, which is doing Kerberos authentication, SSL interception, URL filtering, virus/malware scanning, .... Internet access is restricted and based on AD group membership.#That’s too easy.. Palo Alto with userID and SSL decryption. You can make the rules based on groups to limit what you want and you can build profiles for URL, Virus/Malware, File scanning with Wildfire.. super easy setup. For this setup.. you could do a pair of 3020s unless there is some other requirement I’m not seeing.

homeautomation;9lfflr;1538683852.0;/r/homeautomation/comments/9lfflr/introduction_to_alea_air_smart_hvac_product_for/;Introduction to Alea Air - Smart HVAC product for comfort, air quality monitoring & energy savings;Hello All,As part of the team at Alea Labs, I wanted to introduce[ Alea Air](https://alealabs.com/), a new entrant to the 'smart HVAC' space. After over 3 years of R&D, we're taking a different sensor-based and big data approach to solve the problem of unbalanced heating and cooling in the home with dynamic air distribution.Alea Air transforms basic HVAC systems by replacing standard registers with smart vents that, based on room-by-room preferences, track and adjust temperature, monitor air quality, and sense other environmental variables.To address the common problem of rooms that are too hot or too cold, Alea’s vents use the vast array of sensors they contain to collect key data that’s streamed wirelessly to Alea’s cloud. There this and other data (eg. users preferences, weather and pollution forecasts) are carefully analyzed using machine learning and data analytics techniques to enable Alea’s proprietary algorithms to determine each individual vent’s operating instructions. These instructions are then transmitted back to each vent to meet the homeowners’ preferences.  Alea Air is the only integrated solution that can generate a thermal profile of the entire home, assess the HVAC performance, and provide, room by room, unsurpassed comfort while working with the home’s smart thermostat to run the central heating and cooling systems at far higher efficiency.**Alea Air sensors include:*** Two thermometer and one infrared sensors for accurate tracking of room, duct air and vent surface temperature in each room* Air quality sensors to measure volatile organic compounds* UV and ambient light sensors for room environment monitoring* Pressure sensors to monitor static pressure in the ductwork and protect HVAC systems from air pressure damage* Humidity sensors to accurately measure moisture and ‘feels like’ air temperature* Audio sensors to monitor and eliminate annoying “whistling” sounds* Bluetooth and long-range wireless for easy setup and reliable long-range connectivity to a central Airhub.[Alea Air Product Video](https://reddit.com/link/9lfflr/video/rrjtilfz68q11/player)Alea is now available for Pre-order and the first batch of vents are scheduled to ship in January 2019. More details can be found at[ https://www.alealabs.com](https://www.alealabs.com/). We look forward to sharing more with you and answering any questions you may have about our solution. Thank you,The Alea team;"How does it address the issue that other  smart vents have of causing extra stress on the blower fan/other components and potentially causing problems down the road? #Hey, I k ow I’m late to the party but I’ve been researching smart vents and you guys look interesting.  How long have you been developing this product?  Have you done internal testing concerning effectiveness, efficiency, and safety for HVAC systems that you could present here?  You seem to be saying all the right things, so the one lingering question is: does it actually work?  Thanks#These guys seem like a scam. I would avoid purchasing from them. They look like they stole the Keen Smart Vent IP and made a knockoff smart vent. How can we just filter this subreddit to avoid crap scams like this?#Thanks for the question.  The solution to avoid condensation, or harm to the blower and compressor is to continuously monitor key operational parameters. This is why we incorporate 11 sensors in Alea systems to keep track of critical variables such as static & differential pressure, room & duct air temperature, and humidity to ensure that we never cause excess pressure that could harm the blower or compressor. Our sensors and algorithms continuously monitor these variables and coordinate & adjust the system’s vents appropriately.#There are many ways we are differentiating ourselves from other smart vents.  A few bullets include:• Alea does not require any external sensor pucks -- Each Alea vent includes 11 sensors for broad data capture capability.  • Our sensors allow us to model each room’s thermal profile and the home’s air distribution pattern and provide us with valuable data necessary to monitor the performance of the system and alert owners as to when to change their filter, top up their AC refrigerant, service their HVAC, etc.   • 3 of the 11 sensors are dedicated to determining accurate air and room temperature (taking readings from the incoming air temperature from the duct, surface temperature of the device, and the room temperature using IR thermometer.)   • Air Quality sensor in each unit to monitor healthy breathing conditions of the home.  • Alea has Bluetooth for direct control of the vent from the mobile app and 915MHz radio for gateway connectivity (130 ft range) to the cloud.  • Alea vents include our energy harvesting technology to recharge the battery and enable a multi year battery life.   • 7 initial vent sizes and a modular design for scaling.Thank you.#I'm supposed to get mine shipped March 2019, so I hope it doesn't get delayed like other start ups that I've encountered before... like that crappy Kanoa earbuds.  Right after the second delay, I got my money back immediately.  However, many other folks weren't so lucky.  For these guys, if I don't hear anything about shipping in the promised timeline... then money back immediately.  Hope they don't end up as another disappointment.#There are 3 other companies making smart vents and they're all nearly identical. Ecovent and Keen released the same year (2015), so who's IP is it?The ""IP"" is just a battery powered cloud-connected knockoff of HVAC zoning tech that's 40 years old.#u/nothinrandom Can you pin/sticky/make a calendar reminder to LMK how the setup/initial experience is? I'm about to fit out my house (10 vents/8rooms) and seriously considering Alea. My only hesitation is as yours  early adopter of a ""pre-order"" product. Even though they're already supposedly shipping, they're still listing everything as pre-order status.u/alealabs give me the hard sell. Your additional sensors, lack of pucks, machine learning etc are what's putting you above Flair in my current decision making, do you have any white papers, or data other than the sales material on your website? (do you have any discount codes for the guy about to drop $1500 on your product? lol)#Sure thing.  Though, I'm a bit worried because I haven't seen any online reviews nor have seen the app in either android or apple store.  If some people should already have received this product, then wouldn't the app be made available?  I'm going in with a big investment just like yourself, so I hope this all works out in the end.  Either way, I'll keep you posted.#You raise a good, and troubling, point.  Apparently though, there is an app...somewhere. I found the app developer:http://joelpaynel.com/portfolios/alea-labs/#Thanks for sharing!  Wow.  This scares me even more.  The product is about to get shipped in a few weeks and this is their ""app""?  This is just a UX design.  My neighbor a few houses away, who's an UX designer, could also design this without any integrated code.  I'm going to shoot an email to get status update.  Something doesn't quite add up here."

Why? It leaves the most doors open. Any PhD in ML is competitive as hell because every undergrad and grad school hopeful wants that. It's good to get started early in case you ever do want to apply for it. Plus it's actual research experience so you can see first hand whether you would like to eventually get a PhD or not. My general advice is explore as much as possible while still early. This is the best way to find out your goals, interests, your ""specialization"", etc. The only way to find out whether you will like something is to try it.Oh you didn't like research? Fair enough. Just apply for a data internship next year. No doors closed and now you know what you like or don't like. Plus you just upgraded your network in ML and data science by working in a well-connected lab. As opposed to an internship, you get no connections with data scientists.#Can I ask why you think I won’t? I have no experience in this area so any expertise is appreciated. #This makes a lot of sense and really affirms what I was thinking. I think I’m just hesitant because the internship opportunity came from a really good connection at a career fair which is rare, especially for a freshman.#You almost certainly don't have the breadth or depth of knowledge to do independent research work and no ones going to hand you a paper on a platter because research is very cut throat. Even if they did, the idea would most likely not work/be worth publishing because it would be something other researchers didn't want to work on. Even if it was a good idea, I really don't think it would be feasible to read & digest all the related literature, code it, obtain results, and iterate on the paper enough times to be something a research lab would be willing to stamp their name on. If all the stars align and you've taken 2+ deep dive ML classes so you can hit the ground running, and get a saint for a mentor you'll be lucky to get a last author in exchange for grunt work.&#x200B Hope that didn't come across as rude, I'm sure you're very talented to have landed those two offers I just don't think it's a reasonable expectation. Just look at how long it takes most first year phd students to publish their first papers, and that's with way more years of experience under their belts & a stronger support system. You should definitely still take the research offer you'll learn a lot more and data science @ startups is often a complete shitshow where you're likely to pick up antipatterns.#Not rude at all, totally understandable.

That means a future where my children can also live in a healthy and peaceful world. Luckily I had the chance of working for private and public organizations. Also I have experience working in the construction of fiber optics networks in cities.Within Parksen I bring the knowledge and the experience in creating smart and sustainable cities.**Does it seem like a logical background to what you do now?**Yes! As a professional I see possibilities in creating smart and integrated sustainable cities. A platform like Parksen and ParQ really helps.**Give us a one-minute pitch for what you are doing now.**We are developing a green, smart and connected parking platform with smart IoT devices, AI and blockchain technology,  and a parking app for vehicle owners and cities all across the globe. We also collect big data with which municipalities and commercial parties can create policies or more.The platform will make money based on a kickback fee every time a parking session is started from our platform, but will be free-to-use for cities and commercial parking providers.Making the platform free-to-use for cities and commercial parking providers will help them save a lot on costs for development, hardware and maintenance costs, and gives us an edge while implementing the platform to cities and providers all across the globe.As we already work with 113 municipalities here in The Netherlands, we are looking to finalize our expansion to 14 EU member states, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.Moreover, after our business trip to China, we are happy to see our negotiations to enter 60 Chinese cities moving forward towards their final conclusion, allowing us to start a pilot in Xiamen during the beginning of 2019.As we grow both here in the EU and outside the continent, we aim to bring a global parking solution into fruition.**Why did you get involved with this Parksen and ParQ?**The ParkQ mission, a Green, Smart and Connected City Platform is the next thing for me. Working from a city development perspective in realizing the mission statement is great fun and rewarding. It also helps that we have a fantastic team.**Why do you think it is such a powerful idea?**Saving time, money and preventing someone getting unhappy of not getting a parking spot in combination with really helping the environment. With IoT gathering big data that will serve as a reliable source for creating policies or more.  What is not to like about this idea.**How can people find out more about 1. The Parksen and ParQ 2. you & your work?**You can always check us on our site: [www.parqtoken.com](http://www.parqtoken.com/)Moreover I would suggest going to the “All you need to know about PARQ” as well as Parksen:[https://www.parqtoken.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-parq/](https://www.parqtoken.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-parq/)There you can find our executive summary, token economics, whitepaper and all related docs are available for you to read and of course join us by buying our PARQ tokens with 30% discount.**Anything else you’d like to add / we should have asked?**The Green, Smart and Connected City Platform utilizes the IOTA and Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts, IoT devices, artificial intelligence and a real-time parking app.The Parksen parking app, running in over 113 Dutch cities, allows drivers to find and pay for their parking spaces, showing them the closest one to their destination, saving them money, time and frustration, as well as helping to reduce CO2 emissions.For those investors who ask, correctly, “how do we make money?” Well, we receive a 5% kickback fee on all parking transactions that were activated by our cloud-based (SAAS) solution, and by distributing smart, low priced IoT devices and a free-to-use platform to commercial parking providers and local, regional and national governments, you can imagine how much we can generate when we disrupt a 100 billion dollar industry.I’m confident that with our team, a mixture of seasoned professionals and young upcoming people, we can make a difference in realizing a green, smart and connected city.**How can people contact you & learn more about you?**You can get in touch directly on social media and of course on Telegram.As well as via mail : [support@parqtoken.com](mailto:support@parqtoken.com)Don’t hesitate to ask anything and even better invest![https://www.parqtoken.com/](https://www.parqtoken.com/);

However, the key is not one specific data tool, but using a combination of several different data techniques to increase the efficiency while reducing the production cost. The ever-evolving technology has already bought installation cost of renewable power plants (solar and wind) to the lowest point in history. The big data tools will not only bring it down further but also make such projects more bankable. The bottom line is big data is changing the renewable energy sector for better.

learnprogramming;9n2hgm;1539198653.0;/r/learnprogramming/comments/9n2hgm/hard_time_to_make_solid_tests/;Hard time to make solid Tests;Greetings !&#x200B I am currently working as fullstack developer with Codeigniter, i always had some hard time to make good tests before releasing to production, in your development team we dont have too much time to make tests with stability and product rules.   When i push my applications to production i always had to fix several bugs, even if i make several tests in development process, sometimes this make me feel sad, because we all wanna do stable applications with small bugs.&#x200B My questions are: How you guys make your tests? How can i make a good application even with low time to develop?   I really wanna be a great developer working with big data etc etc in the future, but if i cant make a app without large bugs and without a good stability, this dream is almost impossible :( . I dont wanna transform in a perfect developer in some days, thats why i am asking what is the best pratices to be better :)&#x200B Sorry for me english, i am currently from Brazil and trying to improve.;It sounds like you are not thinking about the use cases thoroughly enough and not doing enough error handling.When bugs occur, it is because we do not understand the requirement or use case well enough.What I personally do is that if it's a small feature, I'll spend some time thinking of every use case that I possibly can and trying to map them out to tests.I cannot over-emphasize how important it is to understand the use-cases. This is where it all starts. I've spent hours bouncing use cases on major features with a team member. If you don't fully understand how something will be used, you will get bugs.#I’m by no means an expert on making good tests, but the few programming classes I’ve taken that have required us to make tests emphasize writing good tests.Since methods are meant to only do one thing, your tests should only test one thing.Start simple. Don’t test basic things that the language you’re using does for you (getters/setters, etc.) but make sure that everything works at a basic level before scaling up so it becomes easier to identify where problems occur if you have a solid foundation.Something else that I’ve been experimenting with is Test Driven Development (TTD). Instead of writing a bunch of code and then trying to write tests, write your tests as you’re going along. If you can’t think of a way to test your method before writing it, then you may want to rethink your method.Lastly, what I’ve found is that you need to distance yourself from your code and the fact you worked hard on it and want it to work and really try to break it. Don’t take anything for granted because users can come up with some really dumb things that could potentially break your code. Obviously you’re on a time crunch, but like someone else said, focus on use cases and think about where things can begin to go wrong.Hopefully I helped! I’m still learning how to write good tests in my undergraduate studies, so i’d love to hear others’ feedback as well.

We mostly use SQL scripts and data analysis based on health care data.I have been trying to switch career. I know basic core java but then I felt Adv/JEE is a little too much for me and the number of tools they ask for Java position are way too many. Eventually I quit that. Then, I started hadoop with Scala (in the middle of it). Now, I understand what my strengths are (after experimenting with a couple of courses and making some mistakes/wasting time actually). I am very good with SQL/querying databaes. Though I am bad with syntaxes, I am very confident with logics/analysis (logical thinking). I talked to some of my friends working on big data. They told me it is very difficult to get into big data without knowing programming (either Java/Scala). I want to work something related to data but not really confident about my programming skills. Any suggestions on possible career path for me? TIA.;Big data without knowing java or Scala? I would say Python probably is the best language for Big data. At least that’s what I have seen on job postings and etc. As far as I know python is the most popular language foe that#thanks!!

excel;9myqli;1539172177.0;/r/excel/comments/9myqli/finding_duplicates_in_datasets_with_address/;Finding duplicates in datasets with address information (customer data).;Hey guys, I work daily with relatively big data sets where I have similar addresses under a single customer account where I have to check which addresses are duplicates and which aren't (please check the link below for an example). To further elaborate, usually an address has 4 main address lines, a City, a County/Province and a Postcode (and a country). My task is to decide if and address has matching data with any other on any of those address fields - there is a specific way in which addresses are set up - USPS for the States abbreviates items like street, avenue and parkway and usually everything is supposed to have its place in one of these address fields. But that is how it's supposed to be done and not how it is in most cases. What I want is to find a method or a tool through which I would be able to more easily juxtapose all these cells and find which ones are duplicates and which aren't and if possible to automate my work a bit - I have seen Fuzzy Lookup and other similar stuff, but I am not really certain how these can apply to my case. https://imgur.com/rj4uFn6Thank you in advance, guys :^);"I’m probably speaking out of turn here but the real merit of Fuzzy Lookup (at least as I’ve seen it) is around typo’s or variations in spelling (translations etc). So it might help you track down instances of “6300 LegacyDrive” or “6300 Lecagy Drive”.Here though it seems that the strings are consistently entered but where they’re entered isn’t, so they’re not fuzzy so to speak. You might be better off with formulas.    =COUNTIF(Table[Addr_2],Table[@Addr_3])    =COUNTIF(Table[Addr_3],Table[@Addr_2])     would give you a very simple quick indication of duplication of a particular record.Edit: another way might be to concatenate the address together for each row, and for each search if particular strings show up in the concatenated range. So =Addr_1&Addr_2& Addr_3&Addr_4 run down your data, and then in each row:    =COUNTIF($that$range,""*""&Table[@Addr_2]&""*"")#Hey, thanks for the quick advise. It sounds good and applicable to my case, however I am looking for typos and mis-abbreviations as well. As in the example with Street where it usually has to be abbreviated as St or Avenue - Ave. #You probably will want fuzzy lookup in that case!"

Advice;9mir8c;1539032166.0;/r/Advice/comments/9mir8c/do_i_need_to_tell_my_bossprofessor_about_my/;Do I need to tell my boss/professor about my supervisor?;"Hello.&#x200B This is going to be asking advice and ranting.So I am working at a research lab in a university as a research assistant and I am also a student in the same university. I have a supervisor who is a postdoctoral student. We both working with a professor who is just giving us a big picture of project and we pretty much carry out whole project. I am from Japan and my supervisor is from China. He is smart in a way working with like big data and running arcane programs. I have some professional career having master's degree and I am in a Ph.D program. He works full time and I work half time. He does speak English but sometimes I feel I need more detail (I even might not convey enough detail here though and I will skip or vaguely say on purpose for my security) when he speaks to me or asks to do something. &#x200B So here is a problem. His working style is really not suit with me and it really stresses me out and I can't spend my time for study.Event1: We planned an experiment with college students and during a meeting he asked me what I would do for some moment of experiment. So I told something and he criticized my idea (I was expecting though) but said if you wanted to do it then do it. I was little confused because it is team project and I don't think I can conduct my own research in the middle of team research which is run by grant. And then nothing was decided during the meeting. But this happens all the time, he always set a meeting but never sit down together and talk about agenda. He just asks do you want to say something? Then I just say something that I have done related to experiment and then he said same thing again, if you want to do it do it. I am exhausted there is no progress because he always acts like if that's what you thought do it when my opinion is not even viable to act in research. I had three meetings for the same thing which is significant points of experiments and logistics and instructions.Event2: So I was supposed to write logistics and instruction to give our experimenters. Our experiment started on Monday and I finalized writing the last Thursday before the onset of experiment. I emailed him my writing and asked feedback. (Because I work only half-time, it is better not to show up in the lab even though I have work to do. People in my lab don't like people work overtime. But it is kind of usual that I work during weekend. :p) Anyway, he didn't emailed me until saturday night. So I sent reminder, if you don't have anything to comment I will send to professor and then I went to sleep. Next day, in the very early morning, he sent me email with a lot of comments and more work which was to prepare materials for experiment which would not complete for one day and said please finish today and sorry I didn't know there is this. I was so angry. He usually just texted me if something is emergency. But he didn't text me or email me anything about work he missed. And missing in action for a while when I asked feedback and throwing bunch of work when there is only one day to finish is not cool. Just not cool.Event3: He looks down on me very implicit way and I don't think he even recognizes it. Also, people in lab like him. What I mean by people in here is who does not directly work with him but more like people do administration or do other research project. Okay it is inevitably true that he knows better than me. But every time I ask something, he always snorts like if I am seriously asking. For instance, does it sound like a joke if I ask how many of college students he wants to have in experiment, or if I ask comment about my writing in research paper. He always snorts at my question. And that really drives me crazy. Also, one day I needed to set up new computer in the lab and asked how to install program. He snorted again and asked you just go to install.. I was like.. is this supposed to be instruction? So I asked other people in the lab and eventually, since he was the oldest who was in the lab, people told me to ask him and asked him by themselves. And then he was like suddenly furious and kind of looked upset and said ""I told you you install can't you do the simple thing? why you make me work?""I just can't work with him like this. The only reason I am remaining this lab is because I like their research itself. But now because of the issue with him, I am losing my motivation and enthusiasm. My professor asked me in front of him, if I like working in the lab. I said just yes because I had no choice and he and my professor had longer relationship and trust and I know I can't be a tattletale and I can't really intervene in their strong relationship.Please advise me what to do.. I was going to tell my professor in private one time, but I lost my courage because I was worried if I got fired and kicked out from the program.";"He sounds like an impatient arrogant idiot. You are there to learn/work not get stressed or anxious. Definitely talk to your professor about this guy#Okay so lengthy story but a lot of those things sound very familiar to me, having been in that whole environment (chem, but you'll find similarities anyhow).On the first point: 'you can do it if you want to' to me it seems like maybe a cultural thing. I've worked with chinese before and they can be very hard to read to a dutch person like me as we're generally very direct and immediately say what we think. It's not the case for a lot of chinese people (at least in my experience) who are taught to say things in a more polite way, similar to the british.Basically, 'you can do it if you want' means 'no, I don't like the idea, prefer if you do something else'. I know that sounds silly, but no doubt this guy, like many others, has their own manual and sometimes you have to learn that the hard way. However, if it is unusual, feel free to urge him time to time to say what he really thinks. If his answer is not clear enough, you have to say that as I don't think he will be default.Second point: It's impossible for us to assume we know somebody's schedule through and through. He likely had a good reason he could not get to your work earlier. And of course, as unfortunate as it is, I want to remind you that working in the weekend is already going beyond your normal working hours. I know, as a PhD you will probably do it plenty of times, but it should not be the standard. However, once again the guy is not doing his communication properly. He should have said if he had little time ""I will look over your assignment at this or that date"". This is for me the standard way my supervision has always done it and it makes it easier to plan ahead for you as well. And of course you should also make it clear to him if he has an unrealistic standard for something. If you cannot complete something in one day, say it, or alternatively: do what you can do and tell him that you could not finish it. If he has anyone he should be angry on it's himself for failing at planning.Third point: Hierarchy to a point is normal and I too was very used to phds looking down on masters who look down on bachelors etc etc. That does not make it good behavior. It is unacceptable for him to treat you like you are a child. You are an adult!He is showing signs that either he has some really big problems going on in his life or he simply lacks sleep and it is seeping into his personality. He is screwing up the most detrimental tasks of communicating and planning. I do not automatically assume there is a bad intention. It may really be that he has little control over it and just cannot focus properly. All the more reason to urge your professor to take contact with him. You can let it be known you are worried about him and the way he does things makes your work inefficient. You don't have to be rude about it. You can be very polite. Your intention is to do your job properly and in order to do that you need a good relationship with this guy too. Your professor understands that. #Wow. Thank you so much for such a detailed advice. One thing I concerned is that my professor thinks this work is hard because it is ‘work.’ And he thinks that we are very good friend...? I don’t know where he got that impression. Lol Anyway so I am worried he just think I try to sabotage him. Also english is my second language so I am not confident if I can deliver this subtle inconvenience in polite way..#Of course your work is supposed to be tough. That's kind of the point...You just have to stress on the fact that you are concerned about him and you feel as though something may be going on in his life which is affecting his ability to communicate with you and it's making your work tougher. You can feel free to cite those examples step by step and urge him to make a separate talk. That is all you can really do."
cscareerquestions;9mbk9s;1538970652.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9mbk9s/competitive_cs_branch_in_the_future/;Competitive CS branch in the future ?;"Did a brief search on a similar topic (for example [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8e2tu4/whats\_the\_best\_field\_to\_specialize\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8e2tu4/whats_the_best_field_to_specialize_in/))Where the OP talks mainly about specialization in AI. I have a slightly different question, that more or less relates.Consider the current state of the field:* CS/Engineering is currently widely considered to be a great field with high pay and lots of opportunities -> probably high number of college graduates* Tons of ""bootcamp"" programs that take your standard Accounting/Math/Electrical majors and train them for a couple months to become ""developers"". (probably something like Web devs with ReactJS experience and the like)As a fullstack, I can't help but feel that it's becoming more and more saturated. This is an assumption, I mention fullstack, because, well, I believe that's where the entry level developers go into, although I love fullstack and the mobility it gives you to work around the product end to end. Which makes me wonder, as an engineer that's already in the field, is there a branch of CS that will possibly maintain it's competitiveness in the future? Something that requires your prior experience, something that you would consider to be the 'next' level? For ex: Big data, ML, AI, blockchain, security, fintech etc.Thanks";"[deleted]#>Which makes me wonder, as an engineer that's already in the field, is  there a branch of CS that will possibly maintain it's competitiveness in  the future? As long as these jobs continue to be high paying, no. People follow the money. It's just a fact of humanity. Even the fields you mentioned as ""next level"":>Big data, ML, AI, blockchain, security, fintech etc.these are all hot as hell right now and everyone wants to get into it. Imo, tech jobs that pay well or are trendy right now are saturated, i.e. machine learning at Facebook making $150K+ in NYC. Those jobs are tough to get because everybody wants them. But if you apply for a software engineer job at a bank in Florida using legacy code that pays $77K, those are much less desirable, and hence ""easier"" to get.So basically, as long as you are aiming for the big paying jobs, it will continue to remain ""saturated"". It's true most people who apply won't be qualified. But money draws in everyone, including the really smart and capable folks. So there are more smart and talented people going into these jobs now more than ever. For example, instead of John at Harvard accepting his PhD offer at CalTech, he's gonna join a quant finance firm because, well, money. Or Harry with the high GPA in every class, who decided to quit pre-med to become a software dev because it's the much easier route.#Thanks for chiming in. Just to be clear, when I say saturation, I mean that there's an increasing number of people that can do that job, making it less in demand. When I say competitiveness, I mean that it's a job that will be high in demand, but low in supply. Whereas nowadays you need fullstacks to build up the infrastructure, the UI and etc. You may not have the same demand for them in the future, there may be enough 'web templates' (think like squarespace or such) hence shifting the demand somewhere else.&#x200B But I do see your point, you need at least some base number of people within some branch for it to be considered needed or useful. Otherwise it's just niche.#> So basically, as long as you are aiming for the big paying jobs, it will continue to remain ""saturated"". It's true most people who apply won't be qualified. That's exactly what I mean. Sure, let's say they're qualified, that's alright. Those are going to be very smart/competitive people. But what I mean is, which parts get saturated by less competitive people. "

I've personally found that someone with an amazing portfolio with no degree beats someone with an average portfolio and a bachelors degree. If I get to choose between two people one has a bachelors degree and the other was the lead programmer on a successful AAA or even indie project. I'll go with the latter.Typically in programming though, most people have at least a bachelors.I may be wrong take my advice with a grain of salt.#If you search here on the forum for “degree” and “career” you’ll find a lot of notes on that.  )Short answer: It helps with visa, salary, understanding CS, and in case you want to work in a few specific research/dev areas.I think due to the high competition these days it would help, my colleagues in AAA typically have a MSc CS.#I think the foundational skills and knowledge are more useful than you would expect. Especially on small teams, you have to be more of a generalist not a specialist. Now you do need to spend time learning some of the game dev specific stuff, but those other things will eventually be useful as well. If we're taking statistically, a bachelor's certainly increases your chances of industry. But if you had an in already, you wouldn't need to rely on it as much. #> my colleagues in AAA typically have a MSc CSIn my second gamedev job, I talked to some coworkers and my tech director said a masters actually devalues you because people think you're too specialized (he had a PhD). Other programmers were a bit more positive on a masters, but generally agreed that it was only equivalent to 2 years programming experience.Now that I've been doing it for a long time, I don't have much interest in masters candidates, but I do want a bachelors (at the very least it shows you can stick to something and complete it).#Yeah, I think a bachelors might often suffice.My last few companies and I are biased anyway and on top of that getting a degree is really not expensive around here in Canada (or in Europe where I started) ... so there’s an abundance of people with good CS degrees.On my current team a typical profile of a junior is 50% programming, 30% communication, 20% tech design, code reviews, etc. But we do also engine and service development for other teams, so I guess that’s more like Epic or Microsoft I guess (also the way they do interviews).  )

(“HTS”), a technological world leader in computer vision image processing-based solutions for Security, Safe Cities, Traffic Management, Parking Management, Law Enforcement, Surveillance and Access Control.HTS’ groundbreaking AI-based vision solutions are currently in use for sensitive Homeland Security anti-terror projects and discerning customers including: the Brookhaven National Laboratory for access control, JFK Airport, Newark Airport, La Guardia Airport, Boston’s Logan Airport, the U.S. Department of Transportation for readers at the US/Mexico border crossing, as well as a Florida municipality, and a Middle Eastern Homeland Security authority for the automated monitoring of sensitive zones.Inspired by time-critical “friend or foe” decision-making processes, HTS’ patented algorithms are based on a combination of cognitive science and machine learning-based (Artificial Intelligence) pattern recognition arbitrated through a multilayered decision-making process which offers both speed and accuracy.The Company believes that integrating HTS’ patented and proprietary AI technology into Quest’s existing Supply Chain offering will allow for automated logistics monitoring and optimization, creating operational efficiencies at the higher margins associated with the AI value-creation paradigm for both Quest and its Fortune 500 clientele. For the first six months of 2018, Quest reported revenues of approximately $29 million.For fiscal year 2018, HTS is expected to generate approximately $10 million in revenue with operational profitability and average gross margin of approximately 38% -- significantly higher than Quest’s average gross margin of 21%. Quest is purchasing HTS for $6.3 million, mainly paid in restricted shares at the average closing price for the trailing 20 trading days.Shai Lustgarten, CEO of Quest Solution, stated, “We are thrilled to bring innovative AI solutions to our Fortune 500 customers in the Supply Chain market. Adding new technology with Company-owned IP was a key goal that we articulated when new management embarked on the turnaround of Quest. This acquisition provides higher margin growth and transforms Quest’s business model by positioning the Company as a technological leader with state-of-the-art solutions in two multi-billion dollar, high growth markets:* HTS’ original Smart City and Homeland Security markets, with applications such as Automated Access Control, Parking and Traffic management* Quest’s original Supply Chain Management market with significantly higher margins gained by the integration of HTS’ AI technology“HTS’ AI technology will take our Supply Chain solutions to the next level, addressing essential needs in Law Enforcement, Homeland Security, Logistic Yard Management, Automation of Parking, Traffic Management and Security.”Additionally, HTS has a Salt Lake City-based facility that manufactures ruggedized computers and other electronics products for a long-term customer base. Quest expects to utilize this facility to support the manufacture of new white label products for its own Supply Chain solutions. The introduction of white label equipment is expected to enhance customer service while driving higher margins and revenue growth for Quest.”In addition to his role as CEO of Quest Solution, Shai Lustgarten is also a major shareholder and the CEO of HTS, and as a result, the acquisition constitutes a related party transaction. Mr. Carlos Nissenson, a principal shareholder of Quest, is also a principal shareholder of HTS. A special independent committee of the Board of Directors of Quest was established to consider the proposed transaction, and on their recommendation, the Board ordered an independent valuation analysis and a fairness opinion. The Board determined that the transaction is in the best interests of the Company, that the consideration payable by the Company pursuant to the transaction is fair to the shareholders of Quest, and unanimously approved the transaction (with directors who are conflicted, abstaining).ThinkEquity, a division of Fordham Financial Management, Inc., acted as financial advisor to Quest Solution, Inc.Mr. Lustgarten concluded, “As an executive of both companies, I sit in a unique position to see the operational benefits of bringing these two companies together and am pleased that the independent board committee came to the same conclusion after careful consideration. We look forward to this new chapter in the development of our Company and believe this acquisition will enhance our offerings and our leadership position to drive shareholder value.”**About Quest Solution, Inc.**   Quest Solution is a Specialty Systems Integrator focused on Field and Supply Chain Mobility.

However, I read some comments on Quora said the developer need to understand Core Java and Spring Framework to work with Hadoop. I just graduated in CS with little experiences in Java from the school projects. Do I need to study Core Java to start learning Hadoop. My background is more Python and C# experiences from the internships.;You should skip Hadoop and move to Spark.

Advice;9n26xg;1539196722.0;/r/Advice/comments/9n26xg/should_i_quit_my_job/;Should I quit my job?;[deleted];I would recommend first trying to become healthy if you are working 40 hours a week at your job. Do you exercise? Do you eat right? For me if I don't workout after a day on sitting at the computer or in general I just get super depressed and can't do work. I know your passionate about developing your game but that's something to work on while you develop your career. If worse comes to worse and you have to quit DONT until you get another position. Get recommendations from co workers if your boss won't give you one and find another position before you quit, and stay strong!#Along the lines of what /u/MobileWriter said. A big issue i see is that you work at home and this can lead to health issues. I've had some hella depression recently as I live on my own in a city where I don't really know anyone (especially now my course has finished), and a massive thing I've found is going outside the house and walking. If you work at home, on a computer, I'd guess you don't spend much time outside and actually looking after yourself.Give yourself a bit of an exercise boost and see how you feel.On top of this you should look at going out and socialising, find a club of people you like or a group that plays a game you like or some society somewhere. Get involved, people help you become happier, it's just awkward to start with.After that you should consider the job - dreading dealing with your boss is a common occurence in many things and it fucking sucks, that's not a place you should work. But you should start looking after yourself first.Further to that, follow your dream if it makes you happy. &#x200B

socialism;9p1kox;1539802935.0;/r/socialism/comments/9p1kox/red_mirror_studygroup_about_technology_gender_and/;Red Mirror: Studygroup about Technology, Gender and Society.;Red Mirror is a studygroup based in southern Sweden. We wanted to bring the discussions we've been having online aswell. Check out our new subreddit:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/RedMirror/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedMirror/?fbclid=IwAR2hq5MpCyY-kn4KG1D3BElniy7qXVCck8PMaYzfn-k5STiDB08vId1REwc) We posed some questions in a text this spring which we'll add here aswell: **Introduction**The  modern world is changing rapidly.  The robots are coming and it is not  only the remaining factory workers  that may disappear: the jobs of  doctors, cashiers and teachers are  potentially at risk. At the same  time as sharing economies are born, companies like Spotify and Netflix  privatize  the free culture created by file sharing. While the medical  innovation  moves forward at a pace that makes the discussion of the  possibility of  human immortality more plausible then ever before,   millions die of curable diseases. Catastrophes amass as societal   development accelerates. As The Accelerationist Manifesto states: “In   contrast to these ever-accelerating catastrophes, today’s politics is   beset by an inability to generate the new ideas and modes of   organization necessary to transform our societies to confront and   resolve the coming annihilations. While crisis gathers force and speed,   politics withers and retreats. In this paralysis of the political   imaginary, the future has been cancelled.”. It is thus up to us to   create – or save – this future.   This is the beginning of a kind of [militant inquiry](https://www.viewpointmag.com/2013/09/25/introduction-to-the-study-of-militant-workers-inquiry/)  that we aim to run as a self-organized study group  both on- and  offline. Together we want to do things like read books,  articles,  sci-fi, watch YouTube clips, analyze statistics or whatever  interests  us. We want to find new points of view and lines of  questioning and do  away with the old. We want to create a space to  connect programmers,  migrants, communists, academics, transhumanists,  discarded superfluous  workers, cyborgs, factory workers, moms, union organizers and everyone  else who doesn’t only need to but who also must create a new world  before this one turns to shit.   In  this text we put forward our own  issues as a basis for future  discussion. Comment our text, share your  knowledge, study on your own,  invite us, join the our study group and  last but not least – fight! You have nothing to lose but your electronic  chains.**Post-Fordism and Political Visions**The  epoch we live in is post-fordist and has succeeded the previous fordist  era. Fordism was a society built upon the conveyor belt of the  automobile industry,  which became the model for hospitals, schools and  the rest of industry.  Fordism was built around relatively high wages  and the incorporation of  the domestic, national working class  into  capitalism, the expansion of the welfare state, the establishment  of  the nuclear family and the racist exclusion of minorities (Finns in   Sweden, black people in the USA). The vision of socialism created by the   labour movement of the fordist era corresponded the society that   created it: progressivism, democratic management of the means of   production and an end to wastefulness. Today, in a post-fordist society  these visions have faded by the way of on the one hand the triumph of  neoliberalism,  and on the other hand by way of the disappearance of  fordist factories  and modes of production. Therefore we have to ask the  same question as  Motarbetaren does in “Sisyfos klasskamp”(Sisyfos’  class stuggle): “What  proletarian believes that socialism and communism  could be about ruling  over McDonalds or Burger King? Who believes in  the democratic management  of a call center?”   So – we need a new  vision. Our question is, can we create this new vision by way of, for  example,  automation and big data? Is communism feasible in the form of a   digitalized planned or sharing economy or would it be something   different all together? Can we use Uber, AirBnB, the algorithms of   Amazon, Wal-Marts digitalized logistics etc, as models for new  possibilities in a global classless society? What do we have to hack?  How do we tear  specific capitalist technologies from their capitalist  roots? Is it  even possible? How can we create digital systems to serve  the people  instead of profit?**Gender Orders, Automation and Acceleration.**Instagram   filters, blue or pink children’s clothes, BBQ grills, birth control   pills, condoms, gender reassignment surgery and lipsticks  are all  examples of how the gender order is related to technology.  Without  these technologies it is difficult to see what gender would look  like  today. But what technologies are subversive or emancipatory and which  ones chain us to the gender order?   Fordism was built upon a specific  type of working class masculinity, in Sweden foremost in the form of the  “model worker” *(den skötsamme arbetaren).*  The male worker did the factory work, whereas his wife did the domestic  work (obviously things are more complicated then this, but generally  this an adequate description of the gendered division of labour). During  the post-fordist  era this division has gradually been erased, a great  deal due to  successful feminist struggles, but at the same time the  disappearance of  traditional male jobs has led to a “fear of falling”,   i.e. the development of reactionary tendencies in order to maintain   privileges and a relative position of power. At the same time more than   just classic industrial work is at risk of being automated.   Self-service-checkouts and robots to take care of the elderly are two   examples of how also feminized jobs could vanish. Could this perhaps   lead to development dissimilar to the masculine reactionary “fear of   falling”?**Global Perspectives**Automation  is part of a global trend. In China robots are expected to take over  tens of thousand of jobs over the  next couple of years. This will  potentially create huge changes for the  global capitalist structures  where the countries of the global south  maintain a form of fordist  production (with parallel political movements  and developments) and  ship their commodities to the global north. At  the same time economic  growth is shrinking in the global north,  presumably because of the  amount of dead labour that has taken over production. This is in turn a  major reason behind the decreasing state socialist ambitions of Social  Democratic movements: with shrinking economic growth comes shrinking  room for reform.  Global  migration is also shaped by technology, from  the self organized text  messaging chains migrants use to share  information on possible routes  and Frontex’ boats and guns, to the  destruction of local job markets or  the war machines that force people  to move. Kurds send pictures and film  clips from the whole world to  Afrin and Rojava and back. Creating  direct connections between people  and over borders is possible in way  unimaginable for previous  generations. The world is becoming ever more  connected and interwoven  at the same time as barbed wire fences and  walls are being erected.  Where are the holes in the fences? How can we  build a new  internationalism in theory and in practice from our small  city of Lund  to the rest of the world. In what way do the technologies we use affect  our efforts?  Environmental destruction is a process linked to migration  in which our world is laid to waste in varying paces from location to  location that in turn drives migration, for example due to drought. The  environment has been changed into a technical issue instead  of a social  one, a question of the amount of cans individuals choose to  recycle.  Yet the human race is not separate from nature (or technology  for that  matter). There is no “natural state of things” to preserve, but  there  is a world being exploited by capitalism. With the old slogan  “Think  globally – act locally” in mind we need to in a concrete manner   identify where and why this exploitation and destruction occurs at the   same time as we gain a scientific analysis and a social understanding   for environmental struggle and ecology.**Struggle and Revolution**Struggle,   just as any human relation always contains material and therefore also   technological relations. We need to learn from the insurrections of  the  last few years. Tunisia, Greece, Syria and Egypt are all situations  that  state and capital tried to cope with in different ways: from the  EU’s  austerity measures that went up against a SYRIZA completely  lacking in  political tools in the era of post-fordism, to the  militarisation of the Syrian rebellion which led to strict hierarchies,  masculinization and islamization of the resistance (all these   tendencies are interwoven). In Egypt the protesters won politically   against the military at the same time as they burned down around a   hundred police stations and thereby robbed the pigs of their bases.   After the protesters initial victories the rebellion was beaten in the   end in different stages by the ballot boxes, conservative islamists and   the military. In Tunisia “democracy” was the counter-revolution and   today the Tunisian politicians are on their hands and knees begging for a  bit of peace and quiet after the austerity politics the IMF has forced  upon the country. If  only the tourists could come back the nation (e.i  the national  capitalism) might rise like the phoenix from the ashes!  So,  counter-revolution has many faces, all of them interwoven binary,   materially, technologically and socially with each other.  Logistics   are central in the capitalism of today. Without a global network of   harbours, ships, electricity, trucks, computer systems, paved roads and   airplanes capitalism would collapse. “Globalisation” is really just   these things interwoven with a politically neoliberal push for   deregulation in order to maximize profits. Water is shipped from Austria   to Sweden  to be sold in grocery stores, oil is pumped in the Middle  East to be  used at a gas station in Lomma, mass quantities of plastic  garbage is  produced in China in order be shipped to us for a small  price, Volvo’s  factories are spread out all over Europe where each  factory and  subcontractor specializes on one small step of production.  This is the  weak link of modern capitalism:  [block one of ](https://beyondeurope.net/602/capitals-art-of-war/)these   nodes and everything falls like a house of cards. But where are theses   nodes and what is done there? What happens if we block them for an  hour?  Twelve hours? Ten days? Are logistical blockades, as a Danish  comrade  remarked, just possible as an activist version  of a short  strike in which you can strike at a particular company,  branch or  region while leaving the system itself unharmed?  How  can we wage  revolutionary struggle today when military drones and  aircraft are  dominant forces in war? We think that we need to study  insurrection as a  global, social and political struggle instead of  simply a military  struggle. This due to the hierarchization that war  entails which  quickly robs insurrection of it’s social character and  leads it back  into statehood. How can the revolution survive if Sweden’s  food supply  only lasts a week (since Swedish capitalism depends on food  imports)?  Could we coordinate a revolutionary uprising through Twitter  without  formal organizing? What do we do when they shut off the  electrical  grid, or when the workers at the nuclear power plants don’t  want to go  to work, or when they roll tanks into the cities? What  lessons can we  learn from the revolutionary wars of 1917 or 1936 and  what is obsolete?  These are questions that concern organization, what  knowledge we need  to learn and which social categories we need to act  together with  before the revolution comes.   The development in Rojava and the  neighboring territories might be the most important place to study.  As a  comrade who had visited Rojava told us: “The Kurds said that they   would have loved to call the international left instead of the USA for   help \[when Daesh/IS attacked\] but the international left probably didn’t   have an air force.”  These  are just a few of all of the questions  we’re asking ourselves. We hope  you will join our collective effort to  understand our digital,  technological world and also work to change it  with us!Organising Autonomously/Autonom Organisering, Spring of 2018;>  The male worker did the factory work, whereas his wife did the domestic worki want to point out this in particular,  is largely a made up 1960s TV image, the proletariat has always been had a large amount of womenAlso automation will slow down not accelerate, as it cannibalizes demand, as well as runs into resources constraints and diminishing returns from increasing technical hurdles.

canada;9pdhx8;1539898386.0;/r/canada/comments/9pdhx8/question_regarding_property_prices_in_canada/;Question regarding property prices in Canada;Hi   I have been researching property prices in various Canadian cities for a big data project.  I see certain sellers with postings like $100,000 + GST + QST .   Can somebody tell me the approximate amount that would be added to a property price due to  GST + QST so that I can come to an appropriate number. ;Laziest realtor ever!!!#GST is 5% and QST is 9.975%.This would only apply in Québec. The taxes at purchase depend on what province you're looking at. In BC, you pay 5% GST on new-built homes only, and you never pay PST, but you always pay property transfer tax (which is like 2-3% depending on the value of the house.)#Keep in mind that there are many fees involved in house purchases across Canada   each is very locale specific.Attorney Fees, Title insurance (optional), Homeowner's Insurance (situationally optional),  CMHC insurance (situationally optional) [Land Transfer](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/07/06/land-transfer-tax-inequality-canada_a_23476228/) and in some provinces HST is collected. (rather then GST/QST/PST)&#x200B &#x200B #It gets a little complicated. GST is 5% charged on new homes. QST is 9.975% charged on new and substantially renovated homes. There is a partial sales tax rebate on homes purchased as a primary residence.

Get a grasp on Python and R programming languages. However, I'm not a back end developer. I will do front end, and like to also specialize myself in stuff like, design for conversion.I do think big data is the future. Though it seems like very few agencies are actually making good use of it. Of course, you could say google analytics and facebook data. But I really mean getting the data from the cloud using Python. &#x200B Walmart collects more than 2.5 petabytes of data every hour from customer transactions alone for example.&#x200B Is it a good idea to do my minor in big data?;"In your Walmart example, they will generally partner with a data agency, sell them their data and then suppliers will buy aggregated data sets from the data agency.Whilst there's a lot of ""big data"" out there, unless you're working in market research, the hard works already been done.Even if you're working in market research, a lot of the data cleaning and processing which R and Python will teach won't be too useful. There's dedicated data science teams doing that.Having said that, it's good to understand how the process works when you inevitably have to work with the data.#Depends on the size of the agency and vertical that you might want to focus on. It sounds like you’re interested in a lot of different things - but, most companies will want someone that’s a specialist. For instance, one of the big4 consultancies will lock you in a basement for two years doing nothing but data work. They won’t care about your design or front end exp. But - for a smaller agency, you’d be awesome. Let me know how it turns out. I’d likely want to interview you. #Well, sadly I live in the Netherlands, so taking the plane to work won't be great!&#x200B But yes, I do think smaller agencies will be better. I do internship at an agency right now, they have around 12 people. Most agencies I see seem to be pretty small I suppose.  But yes, I might be interested in too many things. I study Multimedia Design, there we learn a lot about UX, IxD but also branding. But I also do a lot of coding. So I'd say I'm a Jack of all trades, but I think that can be quite useful, especially in this time and age. "

(xpost cscareerquestions);[deleted];My initial gut reaction would be to get out especially since I have more than a few companies like yours where the project keeps coming till one it is not and they lay off people. There is a 70% chance they will not get the project if they are only going after one project. But with more experience under my belt. I would say stick with it for a year so that you are no longer a fresher and then leave. While you are there work on side projects since you are free and build up your github resume. It will be useful when looking for other jobs.Just one thing do not leave this job without another job in hand, while you are working on your own things test the water go for interviews, see if you can find a company you like and if you do get one and get an offer then jump to them.

Most of their business these days is coming from Linux (Azure) and services (MSDN subscriptions, O365, Xbox). At this point, it seems like they could feasibly get away with open sourcing the OS and offloading the development process partially to the community and make bank Google-style.;I think it’s possible.  But I don’t think it’ll happen. If it did, I think it would be some new form of the OS. Open up the source of something that SO many people use especially businesses, means someone will be looking through it to make something malicious.Some might find a way to fix those things too, but with the current Windows environment and the many years of people and companies managing them and updates the way they do it’d be too unlikely that enough people would get those updates unless they got it though the usual Microsoft processes. But the damage would be done by then I’m sure.Plus all the hooks into their online services for synchronization and deep integration could expose other platforms like Active Directory, Microsoft Accounts, etc... to vulnerabilities.There’s a lot at stake for them to open the existing OS to open source.They do offer some source code to developers (don’t recall the requirements or what fees exist) already though. So it’s not impossible that they could make some things open source. But it seems risky to me.#Uh-huh. And the first thing would be done is deshitted fork without store, telemetry and UWP. Not gonna happen.

Two months ago I started a new job where my life became a living hell. Some software engineer made the initial investigation for the project and it turns out that the plan he made was not very accurate. It is very tight and now we have to fulfill his plan. Not only that but also the projectr is a fixed time / fixed amount project so we dont have a lot of leeway in the amount of time we can use for our own learning. In my last job I was given a lot of freedom with the time in the first six months because I was new and they gave me time to learn the domain. But in this job they are already asking me when I go a day over my current tasks in the sprint. I am constantly late due to lack of my knowledge and my task estimates are always wrong because I dont really know the existing domain/software. **Thankless guy to ""help"" me**Recently they added a new guy to help me. The guy has 20 years of experience so I thought to myself ""Great, finally I will get some help and this will take some pressure off of me"". Well, this has been totally opposite. The guy literally does not know a lot about the programming language we are using and I have to tell him basic things like why there is an error with the ""precompiled headers"". Yesterday I told him how to add a new class to the project. He is taking a couple of hours away from my day every day. That is all ok but what pisses me off is that  he is thankless and says things in the meetings like ""it takes a couple of hours for me to explain things to him and do basic things like add a project"". This is because I have to do magic things with Jenkins, xml and other infrastructure things to get things ready for that ass. When I started two months ago then no one was there to help me. But I am there to help him with every question he has. They probably planned him as a replacement for me because I was going slow due to lack of domain knowledge and I am a temp employee.**Health**The last few weeks have been terrible for my health. I have high blood pressure for the last three days and I wake up stressed with my remaining tasks. When my girlfriend comes to my house I am thinking about how I can speed up my task or how I will manage the delayed tasks in my meetings.**tl dr**I am tired of my current high pressure/tight deadline/no time to learn domain job and I want to change to an easier position where I can also enjoy my life. I am not looking for a testing job and I am ok with software engineering, management, big data or any other cs career position.  **I dont mind the ""CRUD"" jobs or easy jobs if the pay is good.

It’s been less than 30 years since the first website launched at CERN labs, but those three decades are comprised of nearly unbridled growth and participation in a web-based ecosystem. In virtually every way, internet services are becoming more prolific and more popular every year.It’s easy to see why. With nearly four billion users, two billion websites, and readily available access granted by LTE connections and extremely capable smartphones, the internet is the place to be.Moreover, participation is incentivized because the internet feels like an information superhighway where access is cheap, and in many cases, the services are free. Of course, that could not be further from the truth. The [digital](https://www.comparethecloud.net/articles/5-steps-to-embracing-digital-disruption-in-the-connected-economy/) economy is an expansive and expensive ecosystem that’s fueled and funded by user data. According to an estimate by Forbes, internet users create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day – a number so large that it almost ceases to have real meaning.Every click, view, like, and share is collected and catalogued to strategically promote products to improve sales. As Nicholas Confessore recently acknowledged in [The New York Times Magazine](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/magazine/facebook-google-privacy-data.html), “All of this…was designed to help the real customers — advertisers — sell him things.

BlockchainStartups;9lb35g;1538653063.0;/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/9lb35g/the_blockchain_big_data/;The Blockchain & Big Data;The blockchain originated as the accounting backbone for Bitcoin, and it’s risen to prominence as cryptocurrencies have burst into the mainstream consciousness, collecting mind and market share along the way.However, despite all the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies, the blockchain has successfully cut through the noise and established itself as the natural successor to the current, flawed internet infrastructure. Many of the blockchain’s inherent features including its decentralized network, smart contracts, and tokenized transactions reconfigure the possibilities for data security and usability.Most networks are compromised because they have a single point of failure. With a big, bold centralized network to attack and little deterrence or chance of being caught, cybercriminals use rudimentary as well as technologically advanced mechanisms to steal user data. The blockchain’s decentralized network thwarts many of these attempts, and it has other features that advance its security enhancements.More specifically, sharding techniques, which further divide and distribute data among the already decentralized blockchain network, offer an additional level of protection that truly differentiates data storage on the blockchain. Sharding is not a new concept, and it’s frequently discussed as a technique that can support platform scalability, so it’s able to accommodate platforms of different sizes and developmental levels.When coupled with a tokenized ecosystem, these security features make user data more secure and usable than ever before. What’s more, platforms that adopt this methodology differentiate themselves from the existing tech incumbents that currently dominate the industry.Consumers can only have so much patience with companies that consume their data while treating it irresponsibly. Therefore, It seems likely that the next iteration of the digital age will favour companies that build compelling platforms that also value their customers’ privacy and secure their data by allowing them to maintain ownership over it.As the pendulum swings in the direction of privacy and security, organizations should be looking to the blockchain as the obvious next step toward embracing that change.Author: CEO Pavel Bains of #Bluzelle: [https://bluzelle.com](https://bluzelle.com/);

ico;9n3fc0;1539204876.0;/r/ico/comments/9n3fc0/adoption_of_blockchain_technology/;Adoption of blockchain technology;Adoption of blockchain technology will enable faster, permissioned, immutable, transparentand auditable business-to-business interactions between companies and their suppliers,distributors, financial institutions, or regulators. We recommend that businesses consider thefollowing steps to get the most value from blockchain:• Position your business operation as an early adopter by:– Identifying the most compelling use cases by considering the highest-value opportunities– Identifying discrete areas where the attributes of blockchains drive rapid impact– Using design thinking to simplify the user experience and create agile proofs of conceptto drive rapid adoption• Collaborate broadly to achieve globally accepted standards by:– Exploring the role of alliances and how profit pools might be redistributed. Then, decideon your role in building and piloting broader business networks– Consider the blockchain as the new business environment and collaboration as theoptimal way of working, then consider with whom you should partner to create theoptimal business network• Scale lines of business with clear revenue models by:– Looking for new sources of revenue as business models are disrupted by blockchain,for example, consumption-based pricing, licensing and micro-charges and payments– Exploring how new blockchain-based services and apps can replace, complement orscale existing revenue models– Understanding how blockchain might extract further value from other technologies,such as big data analytics, the Internet of Things, cognitive and cloud computing.With the Permian Token we developed a solution to solve the working capital requirements of oil exploration & production companies and oil exploration and production economies, meanwhile democratizing the direct investment sector for the average investor.The result, allowing seamless and transparent reporting of our world’s energy reserves and oil transactions under an immutable trust protocol (the blockchain). The PermianChain also solved theoretical and technological issues of oil exploration & production by allowing public and private sector to sell proven reserves yet to be produced via blockchaintechnology under a closed-loop-B2B-Exchange (the “PermianChain”). The PERMIAN Token Offering will launch 10 billion XPR tokens. It is our intention that at least 8.0 billion XPR will be sold during the Initial Token Offering (ITO) stages at $0.10 per token. Where we anticipate that 87.5% of the funds raised will go into oil campaigns and acreage withproven reserves. Whereas over 6% will be used to invest in continuous technology including blockchain and artificial intelligence for oil & gas exploration and production. Therefore, the total value of circulating XPR will eventually equal to the total value of Proven Reserves that are listed on the PermianChain.The XPR token offering will issue up to 8,000,000,000 ERC-20 tokens for investor contributions. Meanwhile, we will keep 1,000,000,000 tokens for treasury reserves to fund the community’s energy initiatives, mainly for geologists and oil & gas experts who have solid data and studies to work on.The XPR tokens will be backed by Proven Reserves that are identified by the oil campaigns that the XPR will invest in from the funds raised during the Initial Token Offering (referred to as “Oil Campaigns”) and by the oil exploration and production companies that list their own Oil Campaigns and Proven Reserves on the PermianChain platform (referred to as “Platform Prospects”). PermianChain tokenizes Proven Reserves to support Permian Token (XPR) related assets and operations. XPR enables digital transfer of underlying assets value in the form of digitized value of oil under standard conditions. Thus, allowing the utilization of XPR's substantial physical and Proven Reserves as a means to facilitate commercial and consumer transactions around the world. As a reserve digital currency, we expect XPR will become a critical instrument for preservation of wealth and an ever expanding range of commercial and consumer activities using blockchain technology for digitized store of value. ;

ico;9ksc4g;1538499109.0;/r/ico/comments/9ksc4g/challenging_ethereum_dbx_public_chain_offers_a/;Challenging Ethereum – DBX Public Chain Offers a New Business Application Model;As many of new public chains became available on mainnet this year and openly compete with blockchain product like Ethereum , 2018 has been known as ‘the first year of public chains’. Public chains have been drawing lots of attention in blockchain markets. DBXChain might be a main competitor to Ethereum in the near future.DBXChain, released by an internationally well-known public chain research team named DBX Foundation, is a value-based ecosystem of data based upon blockchain. This new value-based ecosystem is a decentralized data community that provides a platform for users to explore and exchange data. It provides a safe data exchange process and users are able to own their data rights. This new ownership with data is based upon blockchain technology.**Original DDPoS optimizes the consensus mechanism of blockchain**DDPoS is a new consensus mechanism that is created by DBXChain for the first time in the world. It helps resolve oligarchy and security issues from DPoS consensus mechanism by EOS. As everyone knows, DPoS consensus mechanism is similar to a shareholding system and its problems are quite obvious: first, it has a low voting rate.More than 90% shareholders never voted. It is because it takes time, energy and skills to vote, which are what most investors do not have. Additionally, there are many challenges dealing with bad nodes. If interfering nodes can’t be checked during a community election, it will put web security at risk.Then, how does DDPoS help resolve security and oligarchy issues while keeping its capacity at the same level? DDPoS makes the whole node selection system “fluid” so that block producer becomes a role, not a node, and this role can be transferred to other candidate producers at any time.With continuous data exchange at the bottom level of DBX public chain, the coupling level between a node and the whole ecosystem will be counted into an election system using weighted algorithm. During this process, users can vote at anytime, and DBXChain thus helps dodge potential bribery and security issues under DPoS system.**Enhance TPS and improves consensus efficiency**Blockchain is a distributed system, and a main factor that affects TPS is networks. Due to a large amount of nodes in a blockchain network are scattered around the world, the web state of each node is uncontrollable and it is hard to set a requirement to their bandwidth or to make sure everyone have access to stable network. This kind of situation is absolutely a disaster to TPS.Compared with underlying systems of “classic blockchain” such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, DBXChain is able to support more nodes– more than ten thousand nodes, and allows users to sign up and quit at anytime. The algorithm uses a voting system among potential block producers and cryptography techniques to improve algorithm’s efficiency. Similar to PBFT Prepare/ Commit, the use of aggregated signatures reduces the size of voting signature from nodes and therefore reduces the use of bandwidth. It also requires to exchange data twice for a block among all confirmed nodes. In additional to provide a good security, it efficiently improves consensus performance of BFT.**Building a win-win ecosystem base on big data**DBXChain has massive data, also many users and clients as resources for support, which make this program special. Many projects invested by Top Venture Capitals had ecological cooperation with DBX. Thus, DBX Chain is able to merge a large amount of support and resources from these projects, which is absolutely a good starting point.As it shows, the consensus mechanism by DDPoS has a promising future. These well-known resources in China chose DBXChain because they all needed internet that not only had high capacities, but was also highly secure and was able to prevent manipulations and bribery. All these requirements were met by DBXChain. In fact, DBXChain will support many developed businesses, which already has a large volume of data on classical internet. These data will test the capacity of DBXChain internet and its security. It is also why the new consensus mechanism of DDPoS and its public chain can outperform Ethereum and EOS in terms of democratization and security.**DataGame benefits its participants**DataGame is a DApp for crowd-sourcing data collection , where DBX demonstrates capacities and feasibility of its public chain. Every data collector can launch a data collecting game using a certain amount of DBX coins in areas such as AI, purchases and IOTs. Owners of data can get rewards by participating in games. They can also search data needed with high accuracy and pay for a specific amount based upon data size.DataGame has largely lowered prerequisites to participate for data owners, making more valuable and long-tail data available for sharing. Additionally, DataGame has also reduced costs to obtain data so that more users are able to achieve goals and get a brand new experience in data exchange in the blockchain world. As we can see, for DBX to build a new data infrastructure, the first step is to use DataGame.Obviously, the third generation of big data ecosystem will be more common, but this area will eventually become the most competitive among blockchain tycoons. In the face of big rival, we are looking forward to seeing if Ethereum will still be a leader in the public chain competition.; Worth mentioning thing that 20 %  of attracted funds will be spent for PR, marketing services and expansion of the project.

I am a 24 year old living in California and I can't decide what to pursue as a career. My ultimate goal is to get a solid career making around 6 figures. I currently have a Bachelors in Business Management Information Systems and work as a contractor for Apple. I can't disclose the actual job title due to NDA reasons but it is a technician position working with software. The issue is the position isn't really the field I wanted to be in and only took the job because it was Apple and it paid decently at about 25 an hour. Based on the project I am working on, it is unlikely that they'll hire full time after the contract ends next year. I could try finding similar positions in the field since I would have a year experience at Apple and that would be a good stepping stone. I do kinda want to becone a data analyst/scientist since I find the field of big data to be quite fascinating. But it's kinda hard to find a position since my background isn't fully in data and my experience is quite limited. I am considering also going back to school for an MBA but wouldn't know what I would want to pursue after. The closest thing I have to a dream job is becoming a psychiatrist. I am a very empathic person and have personally dealt with/still dealing with depression to the point of almost committing suicide. If I could make a career in helping others where I have struggled would be a dream come true. However becoming a psychiatrist would require going to Med School and then training right after and I don't quite have the money to afford it. Not to mention that I don't have a degree in any sciences and it would be a huge uphill battle. So at this point in my life I have no idea which career path I should pursue. What would you recommend? TLDR: 24y/o with Business MIS degree can't decide between trying to go for Med School, following career in field I don't like but building experience for, attempt to be data scientist/analyst, or getting an MBA. ;

CryptoCurrency;9ksjfs;1538500424.0;/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9ksjfs/challenging_ethereum_dbx_public_chain_provides_a/;Challenging Ethereum — DBX Public Chain Provides a New Business Program Model; * **Challenging Ethereum - DBX Public Chain Offers a New Business Application Model***As many of new public chains became available on mainnet this year and openly compete with blockchain product like Ethereum , 2018 has been known as ‘the first year of public chains’. Public chains have been drawing lots of attention in blockchain markets. DBXChain might be a main competitor to Ethereum in the near future.*DBXChain, released by an internationally well-known public chain research team named DBX Foundation, is a value-based ecosystem of data based upon blockchain. This new value-based ecosystem is a decentralized data community that provides a platform for users to explore and exchange data. It provides a safe data exchange process and users are able to own their data rights. This new ownership with data is based upon blockchain technology. *  **Original DDPoS optimizes the consensus mechanism of blockchain****DDPoS is a new consensus mechanism that is created by DBXChain for the first time in the world.** It helps resolve oligarchy and security issues from DPoS consensus mechanism by EOS. As everyone knows, DPoS consensus mechanism is similar to a shareholding system and its problems are quite obvious: first, it has a low voting rate.More than 90% shareholders never voted. It is because it takes time, energy and skills to vote, which are what most investors do not have. Additionally, there are many challenges dealing with bad nodes. If interfering nodes can’t be checked during a community election, it will put web security at risk.Then, how does DDPoS help resolve security and oligarchy issues while keeping its capacity at the same level? DDPoS makes the whole node selection system “fluid” so that block producer becomes a role, not a node, and this role can be transferred to other candidate producers at any time.With continuous data exchange at the bottom level of DBX public chain, the coupling level between a node and the whole ecosystem will be counted into an election system using weighted algorithm. During this process, users can vote at anytime, and DBXChain thus helps dodge potential bribery and security issues under DPoS system. * **Enhance TPS and improves consensus efficiency****Blockchain is a distributed system, and a main factor that affects TPS is networks.** Due to a large amount of nodes in a blockchain network are scattered around the world, the web state of each node is uncontrollable and it is hard to set a requirement to their bandwidth or to make sure everyone have access to stable network. This kind of situation is absolutely a disaster to TPS.Compared with underlying systems of “classic blockchain” such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, DBXChain is able to support more nodes– more than ten thousand nodes, and allows users to sign up and quit at anytime. The algorithm uses a voting system among potential block producers and cryptography techniques to improve algorithm’s efficiency. Similar to PBFT Prepare/ Commit, the use of aggregated signatures reduces the size of voting signature from nodes and therefore reduces the use of bandwidth. It also requires to exchange data twice for a block among all confirmed nodes. In additional to provide a good security, it efficiently improves consensus performance of BFT. * **Building a win-win ecosystem base on big data****DBXChain has massive data, also many users and clients as resources for support, which make this program special.** Many projects invested by Top Venture Capitals had ecological cooperation with DBX. Thus, DBX Chain is able to merge a large amount of support and resources from these projects, which is absolutely a good starting point.As it shows, the consensus mechanism by DDPoS has a promising future. These well-known resources in China chose DBXChain because they all needed internet that not only had high capacities, but was also highly secure and was able to prevent manipulations and bribery. All these requirements were met by DBXChain. In fact, DBXChain will support many developed businesses, which already has a large volume of data on classical internet. These data will test the capacity of DBXChain internet and its security. It is also why the new consensus mechanism of DDPoS and its public chain can outperform Ethereum and EOS in terms of democratization and security. * **DataGame benefits its participants****DataGame is a DApp for crowd-sourcing data collection , where DBX demonstrates capacities and feasibility of its public chain.** Every data collector can launch a data collecting game using a certain amount of DBX coins in areas such as AI, purchases and IOTs. Owners of data can get rewards by participating in games. They can also search data needed with high accuracy and pay for a specific amount based upon data size.DataGame has largely lowered prerequisites to participate for data owners, making more valuable and long-tail data available for sharing. Additionally, DataGame has also reduced costs to obtain data so that more users are able to achieve goals and get a brand new experience in data exchange in the blockchain world. As we can see, for DBX to build a new data infrastructure, the first step is to use DataGame.Obviously, the third generation of big data ecosystem will be more common, but this area will eventually become the most competitive among blockchain tycoons. In the face of big rival, we are looking forward to seeing if Ethereum will still be a leader in the public chain competition.;**Ethereum (ETH) Basic Info:** [Website](https://ethereum.org/) - r/Ethereum - [Abstract](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Ethereum_basicinfo#wiki_short_description) - [History](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Ethereum_basicinfo#wiki_history) - [Exchanges](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Ethereum_basicinfo#wiki_exchanges) - [Wallets](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Ethereum_basicinfo#wiki_wallets)  **Biases:** [Arguments For](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Ethereum_pros) & [Arguments Against](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Ethereum_cons) | **CryptoWikis:** [Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/policy#wiki_cryptowikis_program_-_.28work_in_progress.29) - [Contribute Content](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/contributing)---*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

While its certainly not a simple task, its not incredibly challenging either.#These are basic class projects, definitely not final year project worthy.#If you wanted something challenging that fit into those categories, you could try doing something with the ethereum blockchain. I don't know your timeframe here but if you have a until graduation in the spring and you're ambitious enough, you could make a simple dapp. #I have until May 2019.

The I calculate the top 100 rows based on the total of each row and output the top 100 results to a webpage.here is the python code I'm using    import operator        def combine(dataFolder, getName, sort):        files = getName.split("","")        longestHeader = 0        longestHeaderFile =[]        dataHeaders = []        dataHeaderCode = []        fileNumber = 1        combinedFile = {}        for fileName in files:            lines = []            file = dataFolder+""/tableFile/""+fileName+"".txt""            with open(file) as f:                x = 0                for line in f:                    lines.append(line.upper().split())                    if x == 1:                        break            splitLine = lines[1].index(""TOTAL"")+1            dataHeaders.extend(lines[0][splitLine:])            headerNumber = 1            for name in lines[0][splitLine:]:                dataHeaderCode.append(str(fileNumber)+""_""+str(headerNumber))                headerNumber += 1                if splitLine > longestHeader:                longestHeader = splitLine                longestHeaderFile = lines[0][:splitLine]            fileNumber += 1            for fileName in files:            lines = []            file = dataFolder+""/tableFile/""+fileName+"".txt""            with open(file) as f:                for line in f:                    lines.append(line.upper().split())            splitLine = lines[1].index(""TOTAL"")+1            headers = lines[0][:splitLine]            data = lines[0][splitLine:]            for x in range(2, len(lines)):                normalizedLine = {}                lineName = """"                total = 0                for header in longestHeaderFile:                    try:                        if header == ""EE"" or header == ""DD"":                            index = splitLine-1                        else:                            index = headers.index(header)                        normalizedLine[header] = lines[x][index]                    except ValueError:                        normalizedLine[header] = ""XX""                    lineName += normalizedLine[header]                combinedFile[lineName] = normalizedLine                for header in dataHeaders:                    headIndex = dataHeaders.index(header)                    name = dataHeaderCode[headIndex]                    try:                        index = splitLine+data.index(header)                        value = int(lines[x][index])                    except ValueError:                        value = 0                    except IndexError:                        value = 0                        try:                        value = combinedFile[lineName][header]                        combinedFile[lineName][name] = int(value)                    except KeyError:                        combinedFile[lineName][name] = int(value)                        total += int(value)                combinedFile[lineName][""TOTAL""] = total        combined = sorted(combinedFile.values(), key=operator.itemgetter(sort), reverse=True)        return combinedI'm pretty new to Python so this may not be the most ""Pythonic"" way of doing it, anyway this works but its slow (about 12 seconds for two files about 6MB each) and when we uploaded the code to our AWS server we found that we would get a 500 error from the server saying headers were too large (when we tried to combine larger files). Can anyone help me refine this into something a bit quicker and more suited for a web environment. Also just to clarify I don't have access to the AWS server or the setting of it, that goes through our Lead Developer, so I have no actual clue on how its set up, I do most of my dev work through localhost then commit to Github.";

Abra’s Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Token (Bit10) will track the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and rebalance monthly. Abra stressed that the new token is not a fund. Instead, the token utilizes smart contracts to peg an investor’s cryptocurrency or fiat holdings to Bit10.  * Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange headed by the Winklevoss twins, has obtained insurance coverage for the digital asset holdings under Gemini’s custody. In a press release Wednesday, the firm detailed that insurance coverage is being provided by global professional services firm, Aon. Gemini also maintains Federal Deposit Insurance Corporations (FDIC) insurance for dollar deposits held by the exchange.  * IBM has been awarded a patent by the US Patent and Trademark Office for a blockchain-based secure system. IBM first filed for this patent in September 2017. The patent details blockchain technology that can detect security breaches within a network by connecting monitors to a chain configuration. In late September, IBM was awarded a patent for the autonomous self-servicing of networked devices that would form an Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry environment.  * In a press release Wednesday morning, TD Ameritrade announced they are backing new cryptocurrency exchange, ErisX. ErisX has plans to reveal their full business plan later today, although a report by Bloomberg details ErisX will begin selling cyptocurrency futures contracts in early 2019 while also offering services for investors to trade BItcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. TD Ameritrade currently provides retail investment services to almost 11 million clients. According to Bloomberg, high-speed trading house Virtu Financial and investing company DRW holdings are also participating in the investment into ErisX.  * JP Morgan’s recent efforts to expand blockchain technology operations is part of a larger digital technology roadmap, according to a press release published by ResearchAndMarkets.com. The press release details that blockchain technology is on the top priority of JP Morgan, while other technologies being pursued by the bank include big data, cloud operations, artificial intelligence, and robotics. JP Morgan reportedly has set aside USD$10.8 billion for technology spending in 2018, USD$5 billion of which is set to go towards fintech investments.  * The Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense has sent a questionnaire to cryptocurrency exchanges whose bank accounts were closed by major Brazilian banks. The Brazilian antitrust regulator sent questionnaires to 10 cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bitcoin Market, Bitambio, BitcoinTrade, and Brazilex. This move by the Brazilian regulator comes shortly after launching a probe into six major Brazilian banks for the alleged unlawful closing of cryptocurrency exchanges’ bank accounts.  * The Israel Securities Authority has begun to implement blockchain technology into its messaging system, according to an article by the Times of Israel. The purpose of the blockchain implementation is to improve the regulator’s cybersecurity. The Israel Securities Authority reportedly has plans to implement blockchain technology into an online voting system as well as an information database in the near future.    **Sources:**r/https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-abra-launches-fund-backed-token-product-for-investors/   r/https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-assets-on-winklevoss-gemini-exchange-are-now-insured/   r/https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-abra-launches-fund-backed-token-product-for-investors/   r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/ibm-awarded-patent-for-secure-system-based-on-blockchain   r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-brokerage-firm-td-ameritrade-to-invest-in-new-crypto-exchange   r/https://www.ccn.com/td-ameritrade-trading-giant-virtu-invest-in-u-s-cryptocurrency-exchange/   r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/jpmorgans-focus-on-blockchain-is-part-of-digital-transformation-roadmap-new-study-reveals   r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazil-antitrust-watchdog-sends-questions-to-crypto-exchanges-after-bank-account-closures   r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/israel-securities-authority-turns-to-blockchain-for-improving-cybersecurity   r/https://www.coindesk.com/israels-securities-watchdog-builds-blockchain-into-its-messaging-tool/ ;
CryptoCurrency;9kryq7;1538496598.0;/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9kryq7/dbxchain_dbx_public_database_x_blockchain/;DBXChain: DBX Public Database X Blockchain & DataGame DApp Set To Launch;**What Is DBXChain?**The DBXChain is a new public chain that has been created by the DBX Foundation. It intends to be a value-based ecosystem of data that will be made on the blockchain. This new ecosystem will create a decentralized community that will be able to provide a platform for people who want to use it.This network will be able to provide a safe data exchange process and to allow its users to own their data, unlike many companies that create products that basically steal the data from the user. The DBX Foundation believes that the users are entitled to the data that is produced by them and not the owners of the platform.According to the company, real decentralization can only be found when ownership of data is based on the rights of each person and this can be done via the blockchain technology.**How DBXChain DBX Public Database X Blockchain Works**DBXChain uses a new type of consensus mechanism that is still unseen in the community, the DDPoS consensus mechanism.  The DDPoS is an evolution of the DPoS consensus used by the EOS platform. It was created to solve issues with security and even oligarchies that can arise because of the way in which the technology is structured.The DPoS consensus system is similar to a shareholding system, but it has some obvious problems like a low voting rate. According to data, only 10% of the shareholders have ever voted, which means that 90% have not.It takes time and even skills to vote in a system and that is why most people will simply never decide to do it. Also, the way in which nodes cannot be checked sometimes might create security risks. The new DDPoS system makes the node selection to be more fluid and the block producers become a role, not a node. This makes each role able to be transferred to other candidates at any time.This way, the company believes that by having a continuous data exchange at the lowest level and combining the node system with elections, they can be more efficient as the users will be able to vote whenever they want.Also, the company intends to improve the speed and the TPS of the network. As the blockchain is made of many nodes that are scattered around the world, the web state of each node is not controllable and it impossible to ensure that anyone will have a stable network.DBXChain will support more nodes than classic blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, about ten thousand of them. Also, the system used by the company reduces the bandwidth used by the nodes by using aggregated signatures.The main idea of DBXChain is the creation of a public chain that can be massive and an upgrade when compared to other popular solutions like Ethereum. The company intends to use big data to create a win-win ecosystem that will be used for many projects.With its own consensus system, the company affirms that, after a certain period of time and tests, the network will be able to surpass the quality and the structure of the Ethereum and the EOS Network.**A DBXChain Dapp: DataGame**One of the examples that the company has used to showcase the abilities and possibilities of the network is the DataGame decentralized application. It was created to be used as a way to crowdsource data collection.Data collectors can use the platform to launch a data collecting game using DBX coins as rewards for people collecting data. They reward the participants of the game that help them to get highly efficient and accurate data. This can make more long-tail data available for sharing and help new data researchers with fewer resources.; Good idea and responsible team of developers. I think that there are no obstacles on the way to hard cap. Projects with the same ideas look not so detailed#All interaction in this system is based on the value of certain data, am I a parv? That is, it gives a different company the opportunity to trade it freely, right?
