IAmA;6eg4hi;1496248449.0;/r/IAmA/comments/6eg4hi/we_won_an_emmy_for_our_vr_animation_invasion_we/;We won an Emmy for our VR animation, Invasion! We are execs from Pixar, Blizzard, and DreamWorks. We are Baobab Studios, ask us anything!;"**Update:** Thank you all so much for your questions!! We’re thrilled to see so much interest in our studio, team and projects! We have to sign off for now, but we will be back to chime in and answer questions as our schedules allow. Thanks again, and we hope you all learned something today! -The Baobab TeamWe’re Baobab Studios, an Emmy-award winning VR animation studio!  Our first VR animation, “Invasion!” starring Ethan Hawke, just won the Emmy, with Roth Kirschenbaum Films (Maleficent, Snow White and the Huntsman, Alice in Wonderland) signed on to adapt it into a feature film. Invasion! garnered laurels from film festivals globally, from Tribeca to Cannes. It is one of the most downloaded experiences across the VR ecosystem, and is available on all major VR platforms including Oculus, Daydream, PSVR, VIVE, Samsung, Within, Hulu and others. Our second animation ASTEROIDS! starring Elizabeth Banks was an official 2017 Sundance Film Festival selection and our latest Rainbow Crow, starring John Legend, Diego Luna, and Constance Wu made its premiere at Tribeca Film Festival and Cannes Film Festival this year.  Proof: https://i.redd.it/69a6ctf5eo0z.jpg**Maureen Fan** (Maureen4Baobab)Hey reddit! I’m Maureen, CEO and co-founder of Baobab Studios. I love animation and took a circuitous path to get here.  FF8 convinced me to pursue a career in it (though 9 is my favorite), but my parents told me I'd be destitute if I worked in film and forbade it.  I was UI designer and PM at eBay, then assistant to Zach Braff and Joseph Gordon Levitt's talent manager, then got an MBA, interned at Pixar on the Toy Story 3 production team, then joined Zynga at the very beginning (crazy ride), became VP of games looking over the Farmvilles.  Still couldn't shake my first love of animation, so worked with my friends Dice and Robert from Pixar (and now Tonko House) on Totoro Forest Project, Sketchtravel, and then The Dam Keeper (2015 Oscar nom animated short).  I fell in love with VR when my game devs hacked animation into a headset.  Realized it was the future of animation and jumped head in.  In my spare time, I play Zelda (am a bit obsessive about collecting all the korok seeds) and hope one day Baobab will be so successful that I can ride Shadowfax in my own Shire.**Eric Darnell** (Eric4Baobab)Whats up Reddit?! I’m chief creative officer and co-founder of Baobab Studios. I earned my degree in journalism from the University of Colorado and my master’s degree in experimental animation from The California Institute of the Arts. My first ""real"" animation job was directing a music video for REM (""Get Up"", from Green). Over the past 25 years as a computer animation director, screenwriter, story artist, film director, and executive producer.  I was the director and screenwriter on all four films in the “Madagascar” franchise.  This was a DECADE of my life/career.  Today I'm running into adults who say that the Madagascar movies were a big part of their growin' up.  That's pretty cool.  Before Baobab, I directed DreamWorks' very first animated feature film, “Antz,” which features Woody Allen, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, and Sharon Stone -- and yes, I got to work with all of them!  Woody Allen was amazing, had great ideas and had more stamina that almost any other actor I've worked with.  When I'm not at work I like to ride my electic fatbike, hike, go to museums, goof around on my guitars, watch movies, go to Hanalei Bay and I still play TF2 on my PC -- look for Mr. Peppertree.  Okay, I confess to playing Hearthstone and Clash of Clans, too. I got into VR after my future co-founder, Maureen, put a headset on my head.  VR is definitely something you have to try in order to fully understand.  Well, on that first try I was blown away and together, with Larry, we formed Baobab a few weeks later.**Larry Cutler** (Larry4Baobab)What’s up Reddit! I am the CTO and co-founder of Baobab Studios. I admit to being a computer geek from a very young age, using my elementary school’s PET computer to create Star Wars video games. I studied computer science at Stanford, and as a grad student did early VR research into two-handed interactions with 6DOF input devices (a topic that is now relevant 20 years later). I never realized that I could combine CG and storytelling until I watched Toy Story. So I began my career in computer animation at Pixar as a Technical Director on the films Monster’s Inc.,Toy Story 2, and A Bug’s Life. After Pixar, I joined DreamWorks Animation, where I became the Global Head of Character Technology, leading character development, animation workflow, rigging, and character simulation. I worked on a number of films including Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, and How to Train Your Dragon. I left DreamWorks to be VP of Solutions at an early-stage big data analytics startup company Metanautix which was acquired by Microsoft. During this time I put on a DK2 and immediately fell in love again with the magic and promise of VR.  Maureen, Eric, and I formed Baobab soon after to redefine animation in this new storytelling medium.* Website: www.baobabstudios.com* Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/baobabstudios* Twitter: www.twitter.com/baobabstudios* Instagram: www.instagram.com/baobabstudios* Invasion! 360 Full Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ0fKW5PttM* Asteroids!

Does she act like she's the princess of the universe?#Hi Baobab! Love the work you've done so far. Any plans to expand on interaction in future titles or do you prefer the viewer-as-passive-observer role?Followup: Interactive story VS passive story, is there a difference in difficulty to keep the viewers attention?#Do you play TF2?Well crap, the original question was ""Do you play TF2?"" then I changed to it ""Favourite Movie?"" And I got an answer for the TF2 Question, oh well both questions are still open.#Film has always been a community experience-- people in a room sharing a movie together. Do you envision any way that VR films such as yours can be community events as well?#Hi! Thanks for doing this. Any advice for people who don't work in the most creative fields to be more creative at their work or life? Think your jobs sound amazing.#When can home VR owners experience Asteroids! and Rainbow Crow? No offense, and not to sound too entitled, but it sort of makes me wonder why I bought a VR headset when I have to wait months to see the good stuff. Can you please help me understand why we have to wait?#Any secrets to getting a foot in a door? I do 3d modeling/animation, and it seems like everyone wants experience, but nobody wants to give it! I absolutely love it and feel like I can really tell some awesome stories, but need a chance!!#Baobabs! Like the tree? Like in The Little Prince? Any correlation?#What movie always makes you cry? The movies you guys have worked on make me real nostalgic! Must be great to know the impact you've had on people. Also any current film recs?#Not VR specific. Some digital storytelling seems to suffer in end product with storytelling issues that were likely noticed in assembly or the editing room. How do you get around this? What is the turnaround time on a new scene or edit modeling and rendering vs a live action media's reshoot? Has it gotten much better over the past few years? Do you see this being reduced or will most improvements in technology likely go to quality rather then turnaround and rendering time for the foreseeable future?#Hey! Thanks for doing this AMA! You guys inspired me to start a little indie VR Animation studio: http://studiodisrupt.tv/You all are truly paving the way :) Where do you see the medium heading as the VR industry continues to mature? Longer/Shorter form content? Interactive/Passive? Additionally, how are you guys positioning yourselves to be a profitable studio while the market is still small? #What is the best thing a director can do for you on set?:~)Thank you!#What is a project you always wanted to do but never came to fruition?#What is the very best cheese?#Are there any VR development courses or books you would recommend?#Would you guys read my book if I sent you a free copy? :D#what do you think of the situation in venezuela?#Where do you get your patience for working in Animation?#What was it like working with Ethan Hawke? :~)#I'm a sound designer and have worked on a couple animations and a few games.  Can you speak at all to what it's like dealing with audio in VR?  Does Baobab source out their audio work to other studios?  Any advice to somebody trying to get out of freelancing gigs and get a steady job?  (realizing this might not be appropriate for this discussion... buuut i'm hitting enter just in case  ) ).#I love what you guys are doing! Can I come work for you? #This is a question for the whole panel: seeing how far we've come technology wise in the past 20 years, where does that leave you in terms of the whole 'pineapple on pizza' debate? #Who gets to keep the Emmy?#Did any of you actually work on this game beyond going to meetings about it? #what is the strangest expense you've gotten a tax write-off for in running or creating a studio? what is the most boring part of establishing a studio that can't be outsourced (or for whatever reason, you decided to DIY)?#What 2D/ 3D animated films have you watched that have professionally or personally inspired you?

What are your thoughts on how VR might push more diversity in media?#Congratuwelldone on your Emmy! Stupid question but: does VR have any negative effects on a person's eyes? #Hey there, loved Invasion! I'm a film student who also happens to be obsessed with VR. What is your take on the future of VR as a medium for cinema and television? What kind of content do you think it will take to push VR to the forefront of mainstream consumer media -- or would greatly broadening it's potential audience prove to be detrimental for the kinds of experiences one could fit inside of a VR headset? (These are questions I think about on the daily.)#We seem to be seeing a whole lot sequels now. When can we expect some truly new movies and ideas?#[deleted]#Hey guys!  My girlfriend LOVES Invasion! on the PSVR.  She has made me watch it over 12 times now.    Her question is:  ""When do we get more?!""    My question is:  ""Can you please say, 'NEVER!' ?""    Hahaha.  Thanks for the AMA!!#Your all time favourite deck in Hearthstone and why? :)#A question mainly for Larry -I'm a Character TD that graduated with a degree in animation last year and has been working for a small animation studio as a pipeline and rigging TD since then. I'm stuck in a small area without very much animation work for the next two years while my wife finishes her master's degree, so I'm curious what skills you'd recommend developing in the meantime. In other words, what skills really get you attention when you see them in a TD demoreel? Ideally, I'd like to be working for Disney or Pixar as soon as possible so I have somewhere stable to raise a family, if that affects the skills you'd recommend. Thanks!#Now you guys know know how NBA/NHL players feel showing up at the Olympics. Was this a goal or did it just happen? #How do you go about creating the initial storyboards for a VR movie experience?  If you have rough sketch 2d drawings in a comic panel for a 2d animation, how do you get all your ideas down for the rough idea of where everything will go and how it will move and interact in all dimensions before committing to the time consuming animation for VR?  I imagine that unlike an actual movie where the viewer is looking at the scene from a distance, in VR the viewer is in the middle of the action with stuff happening on all sides.Some movies are written very intricately where a small detail can be extremely meaningful (example:  origami crane from Blade Runner).  Do you think VR movies will introduce an entirely new layer to movies where key hidden story elements might be ""hidden"" around the environment so multiple watches will lead to previously unseen revelations as the movie goer watches at different angles?#Why is it taking so long for the Incredibles Part 2 to come out?#Are y'all hiring?#What do you think of VR pornagraphy?#Hello all!I enjoyed Invasion! and quite fancied the over-the-top cuteness!I have one question that has been bugging me since I saw it and I've been wondering your opinions on it.  My question is about why the user is made to appear as a bunny. When I viewed it on my HTC Vive, while it was cute to look down and see my fluffy belly, it honestly more frustrated me that I couldn't actually do anything in the world that I was now a part of. What made it worse was the fact that other characters acknowledged me, but I couldn't respond to them, and I felt very powerless.  What are you thoughts on this and do you have any plans to address these types of issues going forward?Thanks!  Keep up the good work!#How much did user data influence your design, if at all? What kind of user data is available to you in VR? #Outside of your work, do you guys do any ""traditional"" art like painting, drawing etc. as a hobby? Love your work!#[deleted]#You all have impressive achievements under your belt!Do you guys feel that VR is an interesting and exploitable niche, or the future of entertainment?Congrats on the Emmy!#[deleted]#What does Baobab actually mean, if anything at all?#Hi! What software do you use to create your content?#[deleted]#Thanks for the great experience. As someone who wants VR to really be huge, and successful, It to me doesn't feel like it's taking off. What are some challenges with pushing VR towards the future, and getting more support from larger companies with deep pockets? What are your goals, and how do you plan to be successful with VR being your niche?#Which Disney character do you identify the most with?#A Baobab is like a tree right? Like from Madagascar?#What is the story of your name?#Why did you choose the name Baobab Studios? Is it because baobab juice is so delicious?#But if the baobab has no leaves, how can it photosynthesize?!#For the group:What early games, animators (or animations) inspired your love of the art?  In the last 40 years of interactive storytelling in video games, technological limitations have helped define the parameters for the length & depth of storylines and characters.  In the modern era of gaming, as those limitations seem to evaporate, designers (in 2&3 dimensions) will be challenged to create innovative ways to tell compelling stories.  In these early days of VR & AR, what limitations do you think will help to define the next generation of interactive & collaborative storytelling? #I got one, er maybe a combo Having just bought the PS VR and experiencing how vastly different VR is, can you see it becoming our next leap in Media entertainment (games movies etc)Next question where can I get that movie to watch on my PSVR?#Hi! I love animated movies and I often doodle and draw a bunch of random things. what is a great way for people like me to get started in the world of animation? And also what's your favorite food? #What is the best advice you could give someone in their adult life who has no animation experience/education but is looking for somewhere to start? #where's the bunny from??#Congratulations on your success! With all the advancements in your field over the last years, isn't it getting more and more difficult to learn how to do what you do? Does this slow down further advanced, because it's getting too difficult to learn all the new things? Or are things merely changing with new methods and technologies, while things aren't getting much more complicated? #I belong to an organization called the National Stereoscopic Association. We are fans of anything Stereoscopic from turn of the century stereoscopes to View-Master to VR. We struggle to get the VR folks engaged though. Any ideas on how to get them interested?  We have conversations every year (California 3Dcon this year) and their is SOME VR but not much.#[deleted]#As your time as executives at these other companies were you personally involved in (the now exposed) collusion between these companies to artificially suppress industry wages?#the PSVR version of Invasion! is my favourite VR app on the PS4... and i have a question about an idea i got from it...I noticed in Invasion! on PSVR when you look down, you see a bunny body. I think this feeling of ""looking down and seeing someone else's body"" is such an interesting one that i wonder... **Could the virtual bunny-body experience in the PSVR Invasion! app be expanded into a body-identity exploration app?**If people considering gender-transition surgery could look down and see a gender-switched body that they customized to look like themself (using something like the Saints Row character creation mode) i think it would possibly help them figure out whether they really wanna go thru with the procedure.Same thing with people who consider themselves ""furries"" who wanna see what it would feel like to actually be an anthropomorphic animal and are considering whether they want to invest in a ""fursuit"".or just anyone who wants relief from their body dysmorphia.It wouldn't even need full motion controls, maybe just the head movement possibly combined with optional arm-tracking via the PS Move controller?what do you think?#Why ain't y'all make over the hedge 2?#Hi!

Supposed to be peasant right?#That's a super juicy puzzle to figure out.  I think there's room for both - there's room for just about everything in VR!  That being said we're doing a lot of exploration in interactivity because we think it's powerful that you can go further than just caring about the characters.  That you can act on your caring.    We like to use this analogy.  If there's a little girl on a park bench crying.  In a film, you'd feel real bad for her but do nothing.  In a game, you'd talk to her to get more information or to be a hero, etc.  In real life, you'd talk to her because you're genuinely worried about her.  In VR, we can have the empathy of films, agency of games, and the motivation of life.  <- we're just a baby step into tackling this but that's our goal. #We are exploring several different kinds of interactivity.  At Sundance we showed ""Asteroids!"" -- a VR experience where you, the viewer, are a class C menial task robot and you can interact with the characters and components of the space ship that you are in.Sometimes it can be tough to balance the attention the story might demand with the viewer's desire to interact with the world/characters.  It's a much bigger challenge than for a non-interactive experience.  At the same time, if the viewer is having fun you don't want to discourage them from having fun.  It's all about balance -- and it can be a very delicate balance.#I do!  I can't seem to stop after all of these years.  I am Mr. Peppertree.

Chris Milk made a cool two person VR piece called ""Life of Us"" that is really cool.  We are experimenting with stuff in this arena, too.Nokia has a live-action VR camera that can live-stream high def VR.  So I guess, in theory, you and your friends could go to a concert or sporting event together and watch it as it happens.That said, I think there will always be a place for individual viewers to go it alone.#People are setting up VR theaters when everyone puts on a headset and watches simultaneously.  I haven't been part of that but Eric has.  Eric, what did you think of it?I do think there's a lot to be done on ""social"".  Comedies are way funnier when I watch them in a theater with others laughing, so it's something that VR creators should be experimenting with.  I LOVED Within's Life of Us and hope there are more experiences like that.  I heard the Star Trek one that just came out is like that too - I need to check it out today. #I definitely think there is a place for shared experiences in VR - in fact there a number of great pieces that are tackling this. For example, in Within's Life of Us two people together experience evolution all in 5 minutes or so. #If you want to be a cop or a brain surgeon you have to get ""permission"". The great thing about being an artist is you don't need to wait for someone to give you permission to be an artist.  All you have to do is to make art.  (And you are still an artist even if you make crummy art!)  I made an awful lot of really bad movies -- ten years worth of them -- before I made anything that someone else would want to sit through.  I was working construction and waiting on tables at the time.  But I kept at it and enjoyed the process and somewhere along the way I must have learned a thing or two.  ""Just do it"" is such a cliche these days, but there is some truth to it, too.#when i was at ebay (UI design, cultural anthropology, and PM), i loved my job but really wanted to be doing animation.  I forced myself to draw something every day.  This ended up affecting my eBay work in a really great way, because it made me think differently and exercise diff parts of my brain.  Became more creative in my work.  On actually pursuing a job in the creative industries.  first, the best career advice i ever got was from my stanford animation prof, Lorie Loeb, who was in the circus once and even homeless.  She said whatever you do... do it well because you'll learn something from it that will be useful in the future and the people you work with will respect you for your work ethic and find some way to help you in the future.  That has been completely true in my life.  My b school classmates who became VCs helped me fundraise.  My first boss ever at eBay is doing operations for us.  My eBay UI friends helped me with UI.  I met my mentor Glenn Entis (Cofounder of PDI/Dreamworks anim and CTO of Electronic Arts) when he was consulting at Zynga.  He introduced me to Eric.  Stanford, my alma mater, introduced me to Larry.  It all comes round in the end.I also took animation night classes at De Anza Community College, figure drawing at the community center... took on internships in Hollywood, etc.  Basically found ways to ""do"" and see what I liked.  Doing side projects also taught me a ton - with dice and robert at Pixar. #Hah, that's how I feel honestly as both a CEO and a consumer of VR content.  I'm always saying make this stuff faster and Eric and Larry get mad at me!  ""It's just math, right?""  hehe, but it takes time to make cause we're a small team and this stuff is hard!  <- though to pat ourselves on the back, we're way faster than traditional animation studios :)   Asteroids! should be coming out soon.  We got a lot of good feedback from showing it at Sundance.  People liked it but we're perfectionists so we wanted to take some of the suggestions from people who watched it - gotta make sure we always put out our best quality stuff.  For Rainbow Crow, we've got several chapters, so trying to figure out if we should put them all out at once versus stagger.  #The reality is that creating content in VR is really hard and takes time. We are doing a lot of experimentation on each project and we also are building a lot of infrastructure to support creating our experiences in VR. Over time, we will be able to create experiences faster which means you will not have to wait months between projects. Of course, tackling these challenges is what makes me excited to come to work everyday.#It's all about the reel.  Doesn't matter how much experience you have unless you're applying for a leadership role.  If the reel is good then everyone will want you!  Just start modeling and animating.  We've hired people right out of school who had student reels that showed great promise.#Exactly!  I learned about baobab trees from Ranger Rick, an amazing nature kids magazine - it was a Madagascar issue.  Then learned about them again in my French class.  The word was so fun to say and looked fun as well.  Eric directed all 4 Madagascar films and baobab trees are native to Madagascar...  so that's how we came up with the name.  #Absolutely!  Maureen is a big fan of The Little Prince.  Also, the Baobab tree was the place in Madagascar with the wrecked airplane wherein King Julien would have his town meetings.  So it works on multiple levels!!#I have seen Pixar's Inside Out a number of times with my family and it makes me cry every time. #I cried watching Lion.  I even cried in the scene of Trolls where they were in the flambe pot.  I seem to cry more easily the older I get...   Thank you for the kind words :)   Nemo makes me cry probably because of my upbringing and what it's like to have anxious parents.  Hm, i'm really excited to Wonderwoman.  Guardian was pretty good.  Loved Logan, though it is so dark!  Baby wolverine is so badass.  Last year, I loved Kubo the most.  I'd also watch OJ Made in America.  Amazing piece about race.Whenever Mudbound comes out (saw it at Sundance) you need to see it immediately.  It was amazing and I sobbed.#Carol Reed's film ""Odd Man Out"", for one.  But I'm kind of a sap.#Storytelling can be difficult.  I've been doing it for a few decades and it still does not necessarily come natural to me.  Sometimes you need to get outside feedback.  Even after you have something cut together, in my experience, it is still helpful to get it in front of a test audience.One thing that is cool about animation is that the process is like ""filmmaking in slow motion"".  You have the luxury to be very iterative and tweak things until you get them right.  The same applies for animating in VR.  We can go over a performance many times, tweaking timing, expression, etc. until we are communicating exactly what we intend to communicate.  I think as the tools improve for VR the production process will benefit from both greater efficiency AND the ability to make creative changes more effectively.#Telling a great story is really, really hard in any medium! For example, on a typical computer-animated movie, we spend many years in story development before any actual production work on 3d assets begins. During the story phase, artists will draw individual thumbnail sketches or storyboards for all the scenes in the film. Then we can cut these together with scratch dialog and show the story reel to audiences for feedback.  We can iterate on story reels for several years and go through tens of thousands of drawings that never make it into a film.The great thing about animation is that we can adjust and change the story all the way through the production process.  We are constantly making adjustments to the story and to characters even after we have animated scenes.  This iteration allows us to hopefully get the best story onscreen as possible.  For an animated film, the biggest cost of a creative change is usually not the rendering time, but the redo time for artists to adjust animation, change models, re-simulate fx elements etc. The turnaround time really depends on the scope of the changes.  Could be a couple of hours of work or could be many days or weeks. But we ultimately have the flexibility to make creative adjustments right up until the end so that we can tell the best story possible.We hope that as we create technology and VR production pipelines, it will decrease our turnaround time which will mean that we can iterate quicker on creative notes which will increase the quality of our pieces.#Thank you!  I'm glad you're creating VR, because we seriously need more content in the ecosystem for VR to be a real business!  I think content will get longer.  That being said, younger generations love short form content, so there's room for both.  Right now people don't necessarily want to stay in the headset for too long, so we think short is best for now.  But that will change as the headsets get more comfortable and there is better content.Think there's room for both interactive and passive.  For us we're experimenting more in interactive cause that's what tickles us :)About making money, i think we're in the trough of disillusionment - which is totally normal and was expected.  It's why we raised money to last us as long as humanly possible.  In the meantime, we create content and experiment, so when the mass market comes, we're ready.  As to how to make money, that's gonna take experimentation.  there's making $ in the home (pay for download, in app, subscription, advertising).  outside the home, there are VR arcades and also licensing.#Be super clear about the goal and then get out of everyone's way and let them do what they do best.#always be right :) no pressure eric.  to have a strong creative vision and everytime something someone does aligns with that vision, explain how it's good and how it aligns.  When something doesn't align, explain that.  Always be reinforcing the creative vision so that people understand the choices you're making.  Also means others can make better choices on your behalf because they know what you're going for.#The director is the keeper of the story and the creative vision for the project.  The best directors are able to clearly communicate that vision throughout the project.  And they will evaluate work through this lens.  A great director inspires the team to push the boundaries on what is possible to help realize that vision.  Really giving the team ownership.#After ""Antz"" I started working on a movie that was the story of the Beatles coming to America, but instead of it being the actual Beatles it was penguins.  The plan was to use Beatles' songs.  It was going to be a sort of fable about the challenges of fame.  No humans ever commented on the fact that the Beatles were penguins, instead they'd say things like, ""They are just so different.""  ""They are something completely new""  etc.The Beatles have a rule that they all must agree to do something if it involves their music, IP.  Ringo, Paul and Yoko all agreed.  Before we could ask George he got sick and died.  Later, when we asked his wife she said that George had always said he didn't want to make any more animated films after ""Yellow Submarine"" and while she loved the idea of the film she couldn't risk going against what might have been George's wishes.  So I never got the chance to make the Penguins-Beatles movie.  My partner on Madagascar, Tom McGrath, had just come off of his own failed penguins movie.  The script for Mad 1 had the zoo animals crates washing overboard because of a storm at sea.  Tom came in one day and had the idea for the penguins causing the mishap.  Eight years later the penguins got their own movie!#There was a project at the end of my time at Zynga that I really wanted to do - don't think i'm allowed to talk about it though :(honestly rainbow crow was the first piece I wanted us to do, but it was too ambitious at the time.  I'm happy we're finally doing it.  I wanted to name our company Over the Rainbow after the best song ever written, but Eric thought it was too cheesy...  so that never came to fruition :)#definitely manchego.  firm, salty, and sheepy.#the stinkier the better.  I love epoisses especially with jamon iberico, which changed my life.#VR is so young that I don't really know.  Lots of Universities are either starting programs or are investigating the idea.  It will probably take a few years for some to get established.  I know there are students doing VR projects at CalArts.  Honestly though, there is so much to learn and we really don't know much of anything yet except that VR is not an extension of cinema -- it's a brand new medium.  It will take time for stuff to distill down enough to get into a book.  Right now the best classroom might just be doing everything you can to watch as much VR as you can.#My recommendation would be to just dive in.  Pick up Unity or Unreal and go through their VR tutorials.  There are also a number of great GDC talks as well. #I haven't seen any books, or maybe it's cause I have a short attention span and mostly read children's books.  However, I do find talks at these conferences useful.  Jesse Schell gives an amazing talk and mixes game design 101 in with VR learnings.  Meetups work really well too.  Though I think the most efficient way is to contact any VR developer and they'll be happy to share almost everything with you.  People in the community are pretty chill and we all talk to each other and help each other out to build this industry.  I first got my crash course with Ikrima and Cory at Kite & Lightning - I volunteered to do some production work for them to learn.  They were super cool about it.VR is pretty young (well old in terms of tech, but young for content) so I think best thing is to try lots of stuff and watch other people's stuff and develop an opinion for each experience.  #Yes if it's super interesting and has pretty pictures.  I have a short attention span :)  Eric likes to read so he will likely read it!  #I don't know much about it, but it sounds like a real mess.#because animation is the best art form of all time!  live action is still constrained by reality, but animation is constrained only by the creativity within your head.  that's freedom.  That all these people worked on this imaginary place and imaginary story for a bajillion years, but it seems like only 1 person made it is incredible.  After Finding Nemo, I truly felt I could live underwater - and now in VR, I can.  For me, I love animation because it brings me to a place of wonder.  When you're growing up, society has a way of pressuring you to conform to fame, fortune, power, beauty...  but when i'm watching animation or playing animation (games), none of that matters - it takes me to that 5 year old in me when I thought anything was possible - there were no boundaries.  I leave feeling inspired and that I can do anything.  #I find it to be kind of meditative.  Then there is this huge reward when you're done as you watch this character that you've been trying to breathe life into actually come alive right in front of you.  Suddenly it seems so much more real than you could even imagine.One guy said it's the closest thing a male can do to giving birth.  I'm not so sure about that.  :)#There is something really amazing to bringing fantastic characters to life and making imaginary worlds become believable.  For me, everything starts out with excitement for telling a great story. With each step of the process, the story and characters get richer, deeper, and more nuanced. And when we are finished, the final film is something way more amazing than what we could have envisioned when we started.  The best reward of course is that these films can become timeless. My kids enjoy some of the movies that I worked on 20 years ago which is really special.#Ethan was great to work with.  So full of energy.The narration for Invasion! is based on the intro to H. G. Well's ""The War of the Worlds"".  To give the narration credibility I copied the first page of the book and showed it to Ethan.  He lit up and said that we couldn't have found a better person to narrate Invasion.  It turned out that when he was a kid he ride his bike past Grover's Mill (a location from the story) every day on his way to school. Then at school they would play the Orson Welles famous radio broadcast over the intercom system every year.  Anyway, The War of the Worlds was a big part of his childhood.As Ethan got set to do his narration he said he would try to channel his best Orson Wells -- not do an impression of him, but get his tone and gravitas.  I think he nailed it!#Well, this is a sore spot for me, cause I was stuck demo'ing to a HUGE line of people at Silicon Valley Comicon while Eric got to go to Brooklyn to record Ethan.  Especially sore, cause Reality Bites and Gattaca are 2 of my favorite films and i'm a HUGE Ethan fan.  Not that I didn't love being at SV Comicon, but it was Ethan Hawke!  Eric can talk about it though#Audio in VR is super important.  It immerses the viewer in the world.  It provides cues regarding where interesting things to look at might be.  And then, of course, there is the musical score, which we've had in all the pieces we're developing.  Currently all of this stuff is being done by outside contractors/freelancers.  Even at a big company like Dreamworks Animation, the audio was usually done by people who were not full-time employees of DW.  Getting the foot in the door at an audio service house is probably your best bet.  And if you are serious about it then it is worth it even if the job you start with is stocking the fridge.  Good luck!#A bit of a side answer for you with audio in VR: you're mostly working with sound placement in Unity / Unreal / other gaming engines. For flat 360 videos made outside of gaming engines, you're looking at using something like FB360 to create a variety of outputs from your favorite DAW. Outputs are generally: binaural, ambisonic, or stereo depending on where the final product ends up. Sound is an interesting arena for VR, as it's currently an open battefield for people to figure out ""how"" to do it in the best way to create the best experience as well as solidify a format across the board (every single app, market, client requires a different format, which can get crazy). In my opinion, a great mix is one step forward into creating an even greater realm of immersion.#Thanks!

Please send your resume to careers@baobabvr.com and we'll take a look!#I actually think we need to come at this from another angle -- change our thinking on this.  For many, putting pineapple on pizza is the same as ""doing something"" to pizza.  For many pizza purists, nobody has the right to DO anything to pizza that threatens to make it something LESS than pizza as they define it.So I propose we ""do something"" to pineapple instead.  That is, take a slice of pineapple, cover it with tomato sauce, mozz cheese and the topping of your choice (do I hear ham?) and then bake it in a wood fired oven.  What you have is not pizza so the purists are happy and the rest can enjoy their pizza flavored pineapple thing. I propose we call it ""Cheesy Pineapple Bake"" so there is no confusion.#you mean robot pizzas?  cause that's a thing :)I don't like pineapple on pizza.  mixing up the salty with sweet and sour is a bit weird to me.  also i don't especially like pineapple.#Everyone who worked on the film gets to have an Emmy statue.  We worked hard to make that happen cause we think everyone deserves one.#NO COMMENT#Haven't done tax write offs yet.  But I can say I personally hate figuring out stuff like building insurance, directors and officers insurance, which benefits provider, etc.  The best way is to ask other entrepreneurs cause they've already done the research :) and you can save a lot of time that way!#I posted a couple in the ""favorite movies"" question.  Definitely check out Norman McLaren's stuff.  He was incredibly inventive -- a real explorer.  Worked at the National Film Board of Canada.Oskar Fischinger's work inspired me alot.  Check out Komposition in blau from 1935.Love Tex Avery.  Check out Northwest Hounded Police for a series of hilarious takes.Love ""The Street"" by Caroline Leaf.  Sand animation. It took her months to do and you can see he technique improve as the film progresses.Recently saw Palm Rot by Ryan Gillis.  He made it as a student at USC.  Pretty cool.""Your Name"" is on my stack of DVD's at home to watch.  I'll move it to the top of the pile because of your recommendation.#Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away because there's no bad guy and you can appreciate everyone's perspectives.  Also because they're so fantastical - he's so incredibly creative.  Because it taught me about Japanese culture.  Miyazaki made Spirited Away partially to teach a young bratty girl how she should become more mature.  Also the art is gorgeous - he loves nature and makes me want to live where Arrietty lives or even Howl's Moving Castle (he wanted to explore how society treats older people). Totoro because I watched it in Japanese, couldn't understand the language, but understood what was happening because of the great animation and filmmaking.Finding Nemo because it made me want to live underwater. Learned about the power of environment and mood.  Stanton is one of my favorite directors.  Amazing mood in WALLE too.Liked Your Name too!  Can't wait for it to come to the US.Also ""Father and Daughter"" by Michaël Dudok de Wit and ""Rejected"" by Don Hertzfeldt underscored how it's about the story and not the bells and whistles.  rather a good story told with stick figures than bad story told with beautiful art.#I will admit that I never watched animated films as a kid (my mom took me to see Bambi and it evidently did not go well). Seeing Toy Story truly changed my life. I was in grad school doing VR research at the time, but when I saw this film in the theatre I immediately knew that this is what I wanted to do.  I had friends who worked at Pixar on the film, so they helped me get a job there. #I have not, but (re: Until Dawn) lots of folks are exploring the horror genre in VR.Of the games you list, is there one that you recommend above the rest?#I played Heavy Rain and thought it was interesting.  Looking forward to making experiences that don't have as much of a barrier between you and the other characters (an interface, controllers, text prompts etc).  When we figure that out, you'll be more immersed and think less about the ""gamemaker.""  Check out Asteroids - it's kinda like that except the aliens speak an alien language :)  but the action doesn't stop to wait for you to respond.  It goes on like real life does, but the characters' relationship with you changes based on what you do.#I'd have to go with the duck sized horses.  I think a horse sized duck would rip me to shreds in seconds.#I love horses, which is why my dream is to ride Shadowfax.  So i would rather fight one horse sized duck. #I did work on HTTYD in the early days of the project. The original story matched the book much more closely.  I was creating the character setups for some of the dragon characters including the original Toothless which was the smallest and wimpiest dragon. Eventually the story changed and Toothless became the character that we all know and love.HTTYD and the sequel are two of my favorite DreamWorks films that I worked on.  I am really looking forward to the third one - I think it is going to be amazing!#Larry did!  It's one of my favorites too - loved both 1 and 2, can't wait for 3!#I did not work  on HTTYD, but you are right, they did a great job.  Maureen, in particular, is a HUGE fan.#Thanks!  was intentional for rainbow crow.  1. Thing Chris Milk's ""empathy"" hypothesis is real.  That means VR can get you to care more about others perspectives.  I know there was an experience putting you inside a woman getting sexually harrassed - am curious how that may affect people.  Excited to see all the experiences that get you empathize with others' viewpoints.  2. VR is still nascent so we can all be bold.  It was a huge deal to me to see Fresh off the Boat.  I'm Asian American.  Somehow it made me feel more accepted to see Asian Americans in leading roles.  I definitely think creators should be encouraged to cast more diversely.#It's not a stupid question, but I don't really know the answer to it.  It is definitely something that people are thinking about.#Thank you!  on the eyes, totally important question.  Honestly it's too early to tell.  I know they are doing a lot of experiments on it right now.  There was something about how some people in the army who wear certain goggles need time for their eyes to adjust back after, but I'm not super sure.  #Thanks so much!  I believe a lot of active research is being done to look at VR's affect on people from a number of different angles.  I have not heard of any definitive conclusions yet.#I think it will become mainstream at some point, but it may take a while.  We are at the ""chicken or the egg"" stage now -- there is little reason to fund content when there are so few headsets out there and there is little reason to by a headset when there is so little content out there.  Nevertheless, it will hit critical mass at some point, just don't know when.As far as content goes, it simply needs to be GOOD.  We've seen some interesting stuff, but some if it doesn't really have much meat on the bones -- more like tech demos.  We need rich, immersive and emotional content.  Great games and great stories well told.#VR will revolutionize every industry, not just entertainment - education (imagine walking with dinosaurs instead of reading about them), travel, shopping, even how to browse the internet.  I'm really excited about how it changes medicine.  For VR to become a real business, we need more content of every type, especially universally appealing content that gets more people into headsets.  Needs to be a reason (content) for people to purchase a headset.  Then there needs to be content for people to repeatedly put on the headset (more good content all the time).  Don't think it will be detrimental - will be awesome, because then VR creators will make money, which means they can create more experiences.  #Some sequels are good, like Godfathers! or Toy Story, but many aren't great probably because they can be motivated by $ moreso than the art.  The director and team need to be super into it to make it awesome.  There's an article that analyzed when it makes sense and when it doesn't but I can't find it right now.  Will post if I can find it.I think the blockbuster strategy - see Anita Elberse's book shows that going for the hail mary is the most profitable... so studios have all veered this way.   but this means that the smaller indie things have a harder time getting funded.  I'm really excited about all the indie stuff that's finding a home on TV now.  I think that's a new place to find new ideas.#I really liked The Stanley Parable.  I'll have to check this one out!#I haven't, but thanks for the tip.  I'm going to try it after this - what game system is it on?#hehe well hopefully the next thing we release will make her want to watch it even more times.  And hopefully you love it even more :)  Very soon - this year!#I am really a lame player.  I just try stuff out.  My Paladin murloc deck does pretty well if I get my hits in early.  I also have a warrior deck that is filled with self inflicted damage to draw xtra cards and activate characters like Grim Patron.  I suppose I could look online and find some decks that will help me get beyond level 17, which has been pretty much my limit, but I'm not that dedicated.  :)#Eric uses both script and 2D and VR storyboards.  the more you can work in your medium the shorter the translation time/gap.  he writes the scripts from a first person perspective#Not sure, but I'd love for it to come out sooner too!#you can check our website.baobabstudios.com#Thanks! We are hiring animators, engineers, production people, visual artists, video editors - both full time and contract. Please send your resume to careers at baobabvr.com and we'll take a look!#Thanks for the feedback!  Invasion! was our first piece ever and an experiment to see if we could make VR, so we're really happy with what we created.  Often in VR, you're a floating nobody.  For Invasion! we wanted to experiment with putting you in the experience as a character so you could be a part of the story (i believe we were the 1st for narratives), so you know who you are, and feel grounded.  So we tried it and the reaction was pretty awesome.People in the Rift or VIVE would hop around like they were a bunny around the room.  They would squat (your belly gets fatter).  It now made sense why the bunny would hop up to you and sniff you (if you were a human it wouldn't make sense and if you were invisible it wouldn't make sense).  Made sense why you were so short (to make the aliens seem more menacing as they towered above you).  When the bunny sniffed you and played with you, people would try to pet her, wave at her, and get on the ground to mimic her motions.  When she hid behind you, people said, ""oh my god I'm a bunny shield.  I'm the only thing behind the aliens and the bunny.  I need to save her!""At that moment, we realized a superpower of VR - that people's reptile brains made them believe that Chloe the bunny was real.  And because they had to protect her or played with her, they loved her more.  Like you said, you didn't have much to do - yet, we got that powerful reaction.  We thought, what if we amped up the amount of interaction you could have with the other characters.  That's what led us to Asteroids, which is our 2nd piece, where you are a menial task robot on Mac and Cheez's ship (same chars as invasion).  You're the lowest of the low and noone respects you... but throughout the experience you have the opportunity to help, save them, etc - and through these interactions, you can redeem yourself and earn their respect.  You also have an important role to play in Rainbow Crow.  We're experimenting on how to allow you to interact with these characters and act upon the caring you have for them.  Still baby steps but we have our north star.We're excited that others are now making narrative experiences that follow suit by making you a character.  A lot more to learn.#Invasion was created before there were hand controllers for VR, so we were very limited in terms of interactivity.  When the Vive came out we modified the experience to work with the Vive, but decided not to go in and change the experience to take advantage of the controllers.  We were already charging ahead with Asteroids, which is much more interactive.The positive that I take away from your reaction is the fact VR is super-powerful at suggesting to the viewer that he is a part of the world he finds himself in.  This is great news and really points to the fact that VR is so very different than other media.  I think you have hit on one of the biggest and most exciting challenges for VR.  How do you tell a great story AND seamlessly put the viewer/player into the middle of that story?  How can we take advantage of haptics, other forms of communication, etc, to really cement the relationship between the viewer and the other characters.I don't think there are any easy answers to this, but we are searching for the answers.  And being on that path of potential discovery is pretty exciting.#We showed Invasion! to a lot of people at many conferences given us a ton of feedback.  We went back and made a ton of changes based on that feedback.  That was super helpful.#Not as much as I used to.  Being an entrepreneur takes up a lot of time!  Before starting this company, yeah!  I did a lot of drawing on the side or did side projects with people like Dice and Robert of Tonko House.  #I draw and doodle alot.  Not very good at it, but can't seem to stop myself.  As I said in my bio I also like to mess around with music.  I've got a couple guitars and pianos (traditional grand and electric).  I've got a cajon, which is a wooden box that you sit on and bang with your hands.  I have a Uke that I like to travel with.  I have a cuica that I have a terrible time playing. And I have a mandolin that basically stays in its case at all times.#Congrats!  At Zynga, we mostly hired people right out of school, so I think it's about which companies you apply to.  Also, some of the best game designers I've worked with (e.g, Wright Bagwell) just designed their own levels for existing games or made their own games.  This really shows your passion and counts as ""work experience.""  #I think VR can become a big thing.  I'm not necessarily saying that it will  take the place of movies, tv, games, etc, but it will have an important spot alongside other storytelling/gaming/social media.  And then if you think beyond entertainment the applications could be huge.  Travel, medicine, real estate, education, manufacturing on so on.#Our name is indeed inspired by the Baobab tree.  Eric was the director  and writer for our four Madagscar movies.  Our name is in part homage to these films. You are right that we were also inspired by the ""The Little Prince"" which was one of Maureen's favorite stories. #I learned about baobab trees from Ranger Rick, an amazing nature kids magazine - it was a Madagascar issue. Then learned about them again in my French class. The word was so fun to say and looked fun as well. Eric directed all the Madagascar films and baobab trees are native to Madagascar... so that's how we came up with the name.#It's the name of the tree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdansoniaI like how there's a round shape in every letter and how the image of the tree inspires wonder (which is our mission - to inspire to people to dream by bringing out their sense of wonder).  I sent out a survey to my friends with a bunch of names and most people didn't know what ""baobab"" was - though it had to do with ""bao,"" the asian buns.  But they sure remembered it, so we went with it.#We use Maya to create our models, character rigs, and animation.  We have used both Unreal and Unity for different projects as our game engine.  We have created technology on top of these engines to build a VR production pipeline for our experiences.#Of course we want to do work that lots of people love, but BECAUSE there is no market and no ""rules"" we have lots of freedom to experiment and innovate.  That's one of the things that's really cool about VR, at least for now.#We realize that VR is in the ""trough of despair"" right now.  We expected this -- it happens with many new technologies when there is more hype than the actual tech can deliver on.  That said, the trough won't last forever.  Headsets will get better and cheaper and content will get better.  Companies with deep pocketes will be more willing to invest in content.  But until then Baobab must focus on creating the best content we can and doing everything we can (like being super frugal) to survive until the upswing/market arrives.#content!  there are other things like comfort of headsets and price... but if I had to choose 1 thing it's about content.  There needs to be a lot of high quality content out there for people to purchase the headsets.  And then there needs to be amazing new content every week to get people to keep coming back (and spending money).  To get more content created, creators need money to hire people or they can do passion projects. #original tube arm Mickey!#well i'm asian american so i look most like Mulan and I love how she saves China and doesn't have to pretend to be a man... but my favs are Pocahontas (the 2 culture thing) and Rapunzel from Tangled.  Love Moana's insecurity and how she overcomes it.  Nemo cause it's my favorite.  and Remi in Ratatouille - his dream was to create art and art is subjective.#You got it!#The Baobab tree was in the Madagascar movies that I worked on.  It was also an important tree in The Little Prince, which Maureen is a big fan of.#https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6eg4hi/we_won_an_emmy_for_our_vr_animation_invasion_we/dia9qp6/#I've never heard of baobab juice, but I have seen and tried baobab powder mixed into a smoothie.

The field of view and resolution of the headsets, the amount of data that we can use to create real time content.  Headset comfort.  Limits to what we know about and can do with AI.  And the list goes on.Of course live-action VR is even more limited in some situations because the content has to be recorded ahead of time and so cannot easily be modified in real-time.  This makes interactive live-action content much more difficult.  By focusing on animation and real-time rendering at Baobab, we can modify things on the fly so that the world can respond to the viewer's gaze and actions.  Of course, this introduces all kinds of new challenges and the solutions to these challenges are often hidden or unknown.#I'm hoping VR is the next big leap.  Time will tell!Search for Invasion! on the Sony store and you should be able to find it.#You should do some animation!  There are several inexpensive programs for the computer that allow you to animate and plenty of books and online advice to get you started.Favorite food:  Pizza -- no pineapple.#Like I said above, there are some inexpensive tools out there for your computer and lots of books for beginners.  A little research should lead you down the right path.  If you've never had an art or drawing class you can check with your local community centers and colleges for classes in life drawing, etc.  Good luck!#My brain.:)#Eric came up with Invasion! after watching War of the Worlds again.  He thought it was ridiculous that these aliens with all their advanced tech overlooked something as basic as the atmosphere of earth.  He wanted to push it even further and have the aliens get thwarted by the cutest cuddliest more innocent creatures of earth.  That's how he came up with the bunny#VR is SO different than other media.  It's not necessarily more difficult than before, it's just always difficult.  There are no roadmaps, books, schools that can teach this stuff.  Not yet anyway.  So we have to all figure it out as we go along.  Challenging, but exciting!#I would go to VR meetups, speak at VR conferences, and hold your own events.  #I would say absolutely.  VR should continue to grow and as more companies come online and current companies get larger, the need for PR is there.  You may not need to start in VR now.  Learning about PR in the gaming industry and entertainment in general could very likely translate.#I was involved in that I was one of a member of the class action group that brought the suit against the studios.#Yes!  This could be done.  In fact, some researchers have already explored the body swap idea with real people.  I think you should do it!#That belongs to DreamWorks, not Baobab.  You'll have to ask them.#If you love the idea enough you should be able to find a way to get over your fear.  Think about what is driving you down this path and lean into it.  The more work you do the better you will get.  And, there are many ways to be involved in games and animation -- artistic and otherwise.  But you gotta put the work in.  It took me almost 7 years from the time I graduated from undergrad to get a real job in animation, but I never gave up.  Success is as much about hard work and luck as it is about talent.#Lightning McQueen is Pixar.#""kawr-per-it shil""#In what way are you ex execs from Blizzard?#YES!No......maybe...#Heh, I'll ask our ex Blizzard girl when she gets into the office though I'm guessing she's not allowed to say if she knows.

Is it the challenge of being on the edge of this tech that thrills you, or is it the thought that baobab is literally helping to invent a new genre in storytelling? Or is it something entirely different?Also, as an avid golden age animation nut, I just want to say that I absolutely **loved** the Warner Bros. vibe in Invasion! Chuck Jones' comedy timing is hard to beat.#that was a response for the TF2 question.  I am sleepy.#If you ever need a pocket med give me a shout.#You should check out some mokoto shinkai movies (most likely butchered his name) like your name.#Miyazaki has some incredible movies. I would rate Mononoke as my favorite movie of all time.#Anime was not a mistake#It's hard to know how much the simultaneous viewing matters since everyone's eyes are covered, they wear noise cancelling headphones and can look at whatever they want.Nevertheless, I am reminded of an experience I had in college.  Stan Brakhage taught a class on film history and one day we watched a film by Carl Dreyer called ""Gertrude"".  It's a drama and everyone sat quietly in the dark for the duration of the film.  When it was over Stan came to the front of the class with tears in his eyes.  He thanked us profusely saying that he while he had seen ""Gertrude"" many times, he had never experienced the film as he did that evening.  As far as he was concerned, it was the people in the room that allowed him to have this unique experience.  I don't know if he was reacting to odors we were putting out or what, but he certainly felt like something ""magical"" had happened.  If you want to see some far out films, check out his stuff.Later in his life his eyesight got some bad that he decided to only paint directly onto clear film.  He used a very tiny brush that he would put between his lips to make the bristles into a point and then dip it in the paint.  He did this for years and didn't realize the paint was lead based.  I saw him shortly before he died of the cancer that inevitably came.  He laughed and said he was the classic definition of the artist who was killed by his art.  He was a passionate guy to the very end.#Resonate as I'm at a crossroad in deciding next steps, thank you for this - inspiring.#Ah, so it gets re-tweaked after viewing? I thought that was the final print and you were just holding onto it for some reason. See, I knew there was a reason.#Maybe I didn't phrase my question well enough. I was just wondering why there was a length of time between, say, a Sundance showing, and the release for home VR.#Awesome to hear! I refuse to give up hope! haha....any chance you'd give my site a little once over?   #Thanks for responding, Maureen! That's brilliant. I'll remember and look for Baobab in credits in the future. Cheers to your continued success!#I love that. I'll remember that when u rewatch!#I love this. Madagascar is hilarious and the penguins absolutely stole the show.

Are we talking about robots making pizzas, or actual robotic pizza? Either way I'm interested. #Oh well, Ain't you sweet? :~D Thanks! :~)#> is there one that you recommend above the restI would say ""Beyond Two Souls"" since it's no horror, but more a spooky fantasy story.I also mentioned those cinematic games because I like to hear your thoughts about doing this in VR but in your cinematic way and maybe with interactive choices... like those games. :D#If you find Heavy Rain interesting, than play the other games too, since they all are so much better than HR... IMO those have really good story telling for what it is!> the action doesn't stop to wait for you to respond. It goes on like real life does, but the characters' relationship with you changes based on what you do.This sounds exactly like what I meant! #Thank you for being part of something that is so special to me! It's an honour to have spoken to you. I'm so pumped for the third film! #I don't care of I'm 75 when it comes out, I'll be first in line to see it! 😃 They're such great films!#We're proud to have her as a fellow Dragon Rider! 😊#Thanks for responding! I'm still shocked when I watch FOTB and there's inside jokes that only Asian Americans would get, on network tv. Excited to see the potential with VR.#I'm both optimistic and nervous about Microsoft's partnership with Acer and HP and others to form a line of 6-7 AR headsets, all with varying degrees of quality. On the one hand, it lowers the bar for entry and (if successful) can push for all of those corporate accountants to start prioritizing VR budgets more! But, on the other hand, if each one of those headsets has their own individual marketplace, interface, drivers and peripherals that all might conflict with other storefronts and tech (knowing some of these brands this outcome is not entirely unlikely) then we could run the risk of heavy oversaturation and burn out the potential for at-home VR/AR experiences before they've even been given a chance to take off. That's probably me just overthinking it, though.And 100% YES to the good content! So many moments that I've experienced in VR topple most of those that I've experienced outside of a headset. There's even a noticeable difference when I play -- something about the tangibility of it all, occupying a *physical* space in the world as opposed to merely controlling a vessel really just adds to the depth and brevity that the medium of VR can achieve. #Y'know, I never considered things like travel, shopping and medicine -- there are definitely many, many avenues that you could approach in fields like those. Totally agree with you on the point of more content, but I personally feel that the whole ""quality over quantity"" sentiment should be stressed in VR content now more than ever. Whenever I demo my PSVR unit to other people I notice that their first impression of VR is a lot stronger than, say, a first impression of meeting someone or the kind of first impression a pilot episode of a TV show gives -- it can really make or break a decision to purchase a headset, moreso than most other things. #> that the smaller indie things have a harder time getting fundedYeah, so, I'm not buying that, right?This is Pixar we're talking about. They only ever scored a home run with every movie they made.Now we can't take a chance anymore? With the most successful and brutally talented group of animation makers since Tex Avery? OMG, we might actually make another incredible fortune?Come on, Maureen. You're breaking my heart here.#Thanks!  Can we expect it on the PSVR?#You should try purify priest. Loads of hilarious moments but also a viable deck. It's nice to see that there are people that just want to have fun in Hearthstone. Also, compliments on your work and i hope to see a lot more in the future!#I thought maybe you elaborate on why it might be taking so long. Is the process of generating the content a time consuming process in terms of computer graphics, resources, etc.#Thanks Maureen and Eric!  I appreciate you taking the time to provide thoughtful answers.  I also agree, there aren't easy answers, and you don't learn anything if you don't try.  I look forward to what comes next!#Thanks for the quick reply!I feel that it'll become it's own thing in time, IE that people will have separate TV's, Games Consoles, etc, and then have their VR Unit.I hadn't thought about applications for it outside of entertainment though!#Hehe cool.

There is so much to discover and so many preconceptions that you have to toss out once you get into it.  Yes, we are focused on storytelling and also on finding ways to put the viewer inside the story.  We're finding it to be a pretty tough challenge.  I always liked what Robert McKee said about storytelling, ""It's all about revealing inner character through the choices that the character makes under pressure.""  This implies that you (the viewer) are connecting with the character(s) in the story and care about what happens to them.  That said, most of the interactive experience we have is with games.  I love games and VR and games are a match made in heaven, but on average, games are primarily about being games.  The player is often the main character.  The goal is usually to ""win"" or ""get to the next level"".  Often the story in a game is more of a backdrop to support the gameplay.  These things are not ALWAYS true, but often are.I think that interactivity inside of a story -- where having a great story and telling it well through characters that we really care about -- might need to be a little different.  Perhaps the viewer's urge to interact could be less based on personal goals and driven more by the connection the viewer has with the character(s).  In other words, it's not about the viewer getting what she wants as much as it is the viewer recognizing what the characters in the story want (or, perhaps more importantly, what they need) and helping them to get it.Hey, and thanks for positive feedback on the Invasion! animation.  I'll pass it on to the animators!#Yeah sorry about that, still nice to know that you play it.#thanks!  will definitely check him out.#Man, thank you so much for sharing this  I started watching Brakhage sneaking into Bijou screenings at CalArts (was in Theatre) and found out about his long years teaching at Boulder. I do think that who you're with (or in the case of VR, ""with?"") when you engage a piece, be they friends or strangers, intimately shapes the experience.#Yeah, re-tweaking.  Hard thing is when to say pencils down.  As creatives, there's always more you can do to make it better.  #Yes, me too.   There's a few VR movies I've heard about at festivals that we can't watch yet so maybe that's why for more of them. #It was received very well at Sundance.  But we're perfectionists and after showing it to so many people we saw things we wanted to make even better.  Always want to put out the highest quality stuff so we decided to take some of the suggestions that people had.  Will come out soon though!#In terms of a reel, the best piece of advice I can give is to showcase only you *best* work. It is better to have a shorter reel with high quality work vs. a longer reel with inconsistent quality. A common trap is that people will put everything they have ever done on their reel.  You only want people to see the stuff you are most proud of. Also put your best items first on the reel (in case someone does not watch the whole thing).#HA AS IF THERE WOULD BE ROBOTS HERE ON REDDIT TO ASK SUCH A QUESTION. SUCH A QUESTION HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE ABSURD BY MY ~~PROCESSORS~~ HUMAN BRAIN. #I think you could be on to something.  We've also been inspired by the TellTale games.#So she Knighted you. :_)#This guy needs a raise, I mean he does run everything and all.#Omg, so in love with this. Using Lord of the rings as an example I would spend more time with Sam, Pippin and the One Ring itself. And as a Nazgul that would be heinous. How. ABOUT. SHADOWFAX? Tending to his secret herd and a run with his sons? Yes please! #Han shot first.#That could be beneficial too. I feel like many VR games, although encouraging replayability,  dont do enough to coax players into jumping back into the world regularly  perhaps everything's too static, which ultimately makes many VR programs seem gimmicky. Just saying that maybe *never* truly saying ""pencils down"" might become big in VR, that is constant updates or more interactivity between VR users to keep playera wanting to continue to be immersed by the same VR world. #Awesome! Thanks for the reply! What are your thoughts on sound for reels? I've heard people say it's necessary, and then others say it's a huge no-no...#> I think you could be on to somethingxDThe idea is from u/r0b456's thread:https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/comments/6e1wy6/vr_interactive_movies/#Well now we are sure he kneeled low at one point :)#In my experience we always turn off the sound so I would not spend extra time on this.

In economics, useful probably means profitable.  #This post is really saying nothing.  1. Current economics is heavily empirical.2. Even theoretical economics is trying to explain parts of the world.  #What is the point of a map? Maps don't show you the real world. The real world is 3D, maps are 2D.The real world is endlessly complex, while maps are so simple, just lines on pages.The real world is changing, while maps are static.Maps don't take into account human behaviour or irrationality. Yet map makers continue to make them, and hold great sway over politicians! Maps are not scientific, but they pretend to be. #The advantage of free markets is their capacity for self-correction.The problem tends to arise when markets are far from free.The reason why capitalism works overall is that it is an inherently homeostatic system in the long term in many ways, and it encourages a lot of positive behavior due to its very nature (i.e. building up additional capital, which raises productivity).In fact, this is recognized as an overall advantage to capitalism, and is why it works while many other systems don't.All systems are not going to be perfectly efficient, but capitalism tends to be more efficient because there are more players with individual motivations which push for efficiency.#Oh boy, another comment about how economics is bullshit. You know what? I think medicine is a bullshit field.1. They base all their theories on a flawed base model, *homo medicus,* the perfectly healthy human being, even though none of their patients resemble this. For example, in experimental trials for antidepressants, no one who regularly drinks is allowed to be a subject, despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of depressed people drink.2. It isn't an empirical science. Most doctors don't actually keep up with the most recent studies on how to treat a particular illness, and instead rely on what their mentors taught them to do. This is known as eminence based medicine, and it's the same thing the Greeks practiced thousands of years ago.3. They don't agree on anything. As a result of #2, doctors will learn different treatments and protocols for many illnesses depending on where they have their residency. 4. They've massed up in the past, and seem to have no predictive power. They couldn't figure out what caused the bubonic plague. They couldn't figure out what caused AIDS. They've released countless flawed and dangerous drugs as a result of sloppy research, and are more to blame than anyone for the epidemic of prescription drug abuse.5. They're all in the pocket of Big Pharma. Almost all of the medical research done in the past 50-100 years has been funded by large pharmaceutical companies who have a direct interest in their own products success.6. It's impossible to do an experiment on something as complex as the human body. It's so expensive to do long term trials for real outcomes that most medical trials are short term and track ""fake"" outcomes. For example, most diabetes drug studies chart whether a drug lowers blood sugar, but don't track the effect on strokes, heart attacks, etc. even though those are much more important. The few long term studies we do have show that some drugs can reduce blood sugar while increasing heart attack risk.7. Doctors only pretend to understand how the human body works in the first place. Many admit that something like 30-40% of it is a mystery to us. We're talking about an organism that is composed of the actions, reactions, and functions of billions of cells, millions of tissues, and dozens on organs. It's pure hubris to think humans can ever understand it.#[deleted]#Any comment on the actual substance of the article?#Should be titled, ""Dishonest Economy. Woops.""#I always loved the ""people make rationale decisions"" assumption. My professor had to stop and laugh every time he read that. Occasionally for one of his classes they run an experiment. During midterm they set up a table in the commons to sell/give away pencils for exams. One side gives away a pencil for free""free"". The other side sells them for .25 cents. Technically everyone should get the ""free"" pencil, but the data is all over the damn place. #Every economy class I took (I have a BA in economics) emphasized that imperfect information means that the market is not efficient. Why no one listens to that, or considers it, including some of my professors, always confuses me. It means, for example, that healthcare cannot be an efficient market. #Hahaha, too real...If only ceteris paribus wasn't just theoretical#This is pretty much true. If you talk with almost any respected economist, they will tell you how they dislike every inch of the political spectrum. Every political slant imaginable simplifies economic reality and ignores entire areas that run counter to their ideological position. #I heard both of these rumors and have specifically seen the airline ticket one busted. #This was widely reported, but it turned out not to be true at all.#You're driving your car and inside it there's a chip that says how much fuel you have left, every car has this chip. Every gas station has this data. Every gas station charges for fuel according to how much you need it, and prices jump up substantially when you're too far from the next gas station.Customers still have a choice.Now suppose that gas stations also know where you're going, because they know your gps data and they know you're going on a long road trip. Oh, and they also know the price of the airline fare for tonight that you turned down. And they know you need to refuel twice, so hey. They know your budget for your journey, and they all know your budget for this journey.Basically it turns a price inelastic (almost necessity) good associated with good competition into one that suddenly can become a hotbed of economic profit, without the quality of service changing.You might say ""but people can enter this market"", sure. But to maximise profits, they'll want that data too.Which, brings me onto the point that this is the most competitive necessity good I can think of. There's little in the way of brand loyalty, and you can go to another filling station.But what about water? In the UK at least there's only one choice for water utilities in any area. What if they knew how much money you earned and could discriminate on that basis? That monopoly position just got really strong, because you can now charge every customer X% of their earnings. People *need* water, and moving is expensive, so you just need to charge less than it being profitable for someone to move house...These are both markets where price discrimination isn't so good. Unlike, say, airlines, where price discrimination can be achieved in so many ways already it doesn't make a difference.#There is when the time value of money really dwarfs the delta in price. I'm not gonna spend 45 minutes, 2 gallons of gas, and the depreciation on my car to travel to compare 5 dollar widgets.Analytics in advertising is getting to the point where they ""know"" you want to buy something and so are likely to squeeze an extra percent out of you. Say you are buying an extension cord on Amazon, you put it in your cart with other construction stuff. A few days pass, you come back, the extension cord is now a dollar more, you aren't gonna ditch that cart and go to walmart.com or whatever. You are just gonna shrug and buy it.This doesn't have big impacts to a person, but on a economic scale, a 1 dollar increase in average Amazon order profitability means really really big bucks. #Consumers are almost ALWAYS lazy. Many do their homework on big purchases, but in day-to-day pirchases laziness prevails. That's why we have things like Amazon and TaskRabbit.#Here's some [economic evidence](http://evonomics.com/corporate-mergers-strangle-economy-jordan-brennan/) substantiating that article's point.#Yeah, Uchicago economists are notoriously garbage.Come on. It's not an academic paper. It's a casual blog post.#[deleted]#How does that prevent the case where there's only one firm to compare?#> This is the kind of shit people who stopped at econ 203 freshman yearYou're being too generous.

Economics at the macroeconomic level is about net SOCIAL benefit. Maximizing efficiency. Helping the most at the expense of the least that you can. Never has any real economist said that no one is harmed, they say it is in society's best interest that we use our resources to do something else.This is sorely misunderstood and why we should invest HEAVILY in higher education. Retraining is going to become more crucial than ever in the future and we need to find a way to make it as little of a burden as possible. Fighting it for purely political reasons will be far more damaging in the long run.#Society, or GDP?      How do you differentiate technological advancement from higher wealth? Economists seem to commonly credit 'markets' for improvements in technology.#""Society"" can be averaged out ... But made up of very few winners.#> Big data, algorithms, and artificial intelligence, they argue, can all be used to potentially harm competition and consumers. Big data and analytics could lead to “near perfect” price discrimination. They could also lead to behavioral discrimination: Firms that harvest users’ personal data could tailor their advertising and marketing to target them at critical moments, “with the right price and emotional pitch.” Super-platforms, like Google, can potentially exclude or hinder independent apps and favor their own rival services. None of this is new. The gas station nearest the highway charges more. Target gives you a discount to use their credit facilities. Etc etc. That price discrimination point in particular. I assume it's included to argue that is anti competitive in some way. But it's an age old inefficiency simply done a different way, not something new and not clearly anti competitive. It'd be nice if one can assume away the lack of information the consumer has in this case but it has always been there and arguably is at its least with the **Internet** (which Google cannot exist without, so analyzing Google in a vacuum without the rest of the internet is pointless).#My favorite stats quote.

So we should not rely on the government and just let people do what they value because, after all, they're rational.But then game theory demonstrates that there needs to be some way to coordinate and enforce decisions in order to reach the optimum outcome. And we have that technique -- it's called regulation.#Alot of people have incentive to keep things the way they are. Pretty much the answer to that imo.#> You're driving your car and inside it there's a chip that says how much fuel you have left, every car has this chip. Every gas station has this data. Every gas station charges for fuel according to how much you need it, and prices jump up substantially when you're too far from the next gas station.Then I'll only buy 5 litres at the expensive no-other-choice station, and then fill up the rest for cheap at the next station.I outsmarted big data. Where's my prize?#>In the UK at least there's only one choice for water utilities in any area. What if they knew how much money you earned and could discriminate on that basis?Since you don't understand what a ""utility"" is, you really shouldn't post about them.People understood this problem 100 years ago. Which is why we have ""utilities"" - regulated providers who, in exchange for a monopoly, give up the power to set their own prices. *That's how utilities work.*  That's what they are. Utilities can't price discriminate *because they are utilities*. #It would be awesome if gas stations started doing that. I would immediately take out the biggest loan I could and I would start a line of gas stations that didn't do that and I'd make a killing. Gotta love capitalism. #Well, you're also imagining a market there that would require some kind of force or fraud in order to get consumers to the point that they agree to have this chip in their car in the first place. It's at least a very unlikely scenario. Markets would certainly always fail, if they only operated in one, fixed sphere, like you're describing...but in reality, substitutions and solutions tend to occur out-of-band.I think that, beyond the reality of information assymetry, and the market mechanisms to correct such, youre ignoring the abstract nature of ""goods"". You can't just simply classify gas from gas station A here next to the highway, as being the same good as gas from gas station B over here, cheaper, but a half-mile in  and then start doing economics, comparing the two and chalking up the price difference to market failure.  To each individual consumer who knows of both stations, the gas from the two stations is not the same good.  The gas from A is more convenient (i.e. monetary factors are not the only factors... the fuel cost of fuel expended for pulling a half mile off the freeway is not the only cost considered). The gas from B is coupled with the better cleanliness and safer feel of the location. The gas from A comes with the value of a free air pump.Viewed like this, marketing and even price discrimination just as often provides valuable signalling to the consumer as it creates inefficiencies. #Your example is so far from reality that I can't take anything you said seriously.#> Say you are buying an extension cord on Amazon, you put it in your cart with other construction stuff.Why did I put it in my cart and not buy it?>A few days pass, you come back, the extension cord is now a dollar more, you aren't gonna ditch that cart and go to walmart.com or whatever.Actually, there's a good chance you will. Consumers aren't always rational and hate the feeling that they are being taken advantage of. Even consumers who would have paid more for the extension cord in the first place will be resistant to paying more for it *now*. #Exactly- the point is to provoke thought, not flesh out the argument in its entirety. It's based on a panel discussion, for Pete's sake#you will be *shocked* to find out there were no chicago economists on the panel! but that might require reading the whole article...#I rarely see advertising online that's for a product I haven't heard of before. If I was just on on a site like Amazon it's usually for products I recently looked at first. As time goes on they start cycling back through past purchases or viewed history and throw that at me, and show it when it's had a price reduction.#Is that necessarily a problem?#Let's not forget to include the obvious historical reductionism that is far too frequent (including the OP of this comment thread). Making broad claims about not only the history of economic through, but also the history of mankind as a whole. #But you commented on Economists as a whole instead of the article. What's specifically wrong with this article?#The problem with economics at the macroeconomic level in this day and age is that the policies most of that community has been championing since the late 1960's has come at great expense to the vast majority while benefitting too few to matter in a meaningful way, especially in the U.S.  U.S. macroeconomic policies are supposed to benefit most Americans, not foreign nationals and U.S. oligarchs at their expense.  Suggestions to the contrary fly in the face of the very purpose and goals for U.S. economic policies as dictated by the U.S. Constitution.While I'm a firm believer in the virtues of education and training, I can't help but notice that the business community willfully abandoned investments in those areas of its labor costs in recent decades.  Beyond that glaring history, what and where are these ""magic jobs"" that the economically disenfranchised in the U.S. are supposed to fill?  We've heard the retraining meme ad nauseam since NAFTA was negotiated/implemented but those ""efforts"" have done nothing to replace the economic opportunities destroyed by the macroeconomists who claim to be experts on economic matters.  Quite frankly, it's time to fire any economist or influential adviser who persists in championing the very same failed U.S. economic and fiscal policies as if those disasters will ever produce a different outcome than ongoing economic deterioration for most Americans. #There's a big difference between useful higher education, and learning about something at  a bachelor's level that cannot generate any value. #Yes, that's true. But free trade is beneficial for the masses as it increases the consumer surplus by decreasing the prices of commodities. I'm not read well enough to make definitive statement but I think current issues of inequality are not free trade related.#You're wrong, actually. Society is made up overwhelmingly of winners.The losers of free trade are the dregs of society (because why hire the dregs here when you can hire better people elsewhere?) and the monopolists (whose monopolies are threatened by free trade).The winners are everyone who isn't one of those two things - they enjoy more and cheaper and better goods and services and have much greater opportunity.Indeed, in the long run, the dregs end up benefitting as well, though their benefits are more indirect (i.e. living in more prosperous societies has an overall positive effect on the dregs).#Ok, but what if gas stations charged more based on how much fuel you had left in your car?That would be new.Or the local shop charges you more for the fruits and vegetables that you need for the recipe that you had just read in a magazine and decided you want to make.Or you talk to your friend about how you really want takeaway tonight, so the special offer that you might have been emailed isn't emailed. Or it is, but it's smaller.These are the new phenomena. Price discrimination is fine, but how price discrimination occurs matters. And the way to put a stop to it is to stop companies from tracking where you have visited when you're not on their site. (Or legislate on how this data can be used). #[deleted]#The argument is not that firms with market power can't price discriminate in the past, or price discriminate reduce comprtition. It is that they can do it better now, and that means if a firm has market power, consumers are worse off. #You shouldn't compare maps to economic models they really aren't similar.

You obviously have never seen this type of comment 100 times before. I'm assuming **maximum** stupidity because every single time someone has said ""economic models don't real"" they always mean ""economics is bullshit"". You don't even need experience with these comments to tell, you can get it from the overall vibe.  #You're right. Developmental economics isn't supposed to help people in developing countries. It's designed to oppress the proletariat masses.#Wow that's some real insightful information you have there, Michael Gove. You should give Yale, Stanford, Brown, Berkeley, MIT, and and Harvard's deans a call and tell them they're wasting money on their economics departments. I'm sure they'll value your opinion and give you a full-ride scholarship for that ground-breaking revelation, and for being the first eighth-grader to disprove the usefulness of a science.    #His thinking was that at a certain price point, and given a certain timeframe, that yes people do make very rational decisions on the whole. However if you put them on a time crunch (getting to class or missing a mid term) or you offered a price difference so low, that most people just don't care (.25 cents vs free).Then rationality goes out the window. Basically being rational has its own price points and rather than assuming people were rational, you had to ask at what point and when do they become rational. It was some really cool shit. I never fully understood it, I only took Econ 101 and 102. #I have a partnership with the next station and those in the surrounding areas. We share metadata for a nominal fee. I just sold only 5 liters of fuel for X price. By the time you get to the next station the price has been adjusted. Your prize = the good feeling that at least you're not supporting THAT company. #Except you wouldn't. If you draw your supply and demand graph, a gas station that had all of this information would be able to tap into the higher end of the demand curve. You'd be able to compete on the lower end only.Because the gas stations identify those who are willing to pay the most for petrol and target them accordingly, you're basically not competing for the same passengers, you're competing for low profit customers only. And if you own enough of the petrol stations to actually disrupt that practice, you'd be in a position where you'd benefit from it. And remember, also, that the other companies can cross subsidise their high-paying customers to get the smaller profit from price scrutinising customers.Like, a company dreams of being able to charge exactly how much customer is willing to pay for a product.Also, let's be generous here, under current petrol stations in the UK you have a +/- maybe 5 pence a litre on petrol prices between petrol and diesel. And people still go to the BP that charges 2/3p more per litre than the Tesco, on a 50 litre tank that's an extra £1/1.50. And these are **literally** a two minute drive apart. And half of that is tax. So we're talking 1%-2% difference in revenue at maximum (the upper bound is where all customers pay the higher price) from the normal revenue.In an industry that's struggling (we've lost about 1/3rd of petrol stations in the UK since 2000) that's not enough to actually justify taking loans out to establish businesses. You'd probably be better off setting up a company that used drones to deliver petrol and use that to cut down on overheads as a way of competing.#> require some kind of force or fraud in order to get consumers to the point that they agree to have this chip in their car in the first placeConsidering how many people are totally fine handing over their data for similar uses to web services, it's likely they would just accept this, especially if the tracking program was a mandatory inclusion in the best car software.Especially for self driving algorithms, developing them to a functional state is going to end up having been an investment of decades and many billions of dollars.

The data collected on the population for marketing purposes has much higher fidelity than that of information publicly available to the population about products. Advertising firms and marketing campaigns work to erase negative data and reinforce/promote positive data for their products, and have the resources to do so on a massive scale and believably enough to offset whatever valid reviews or information might exist.You see this happen with Yelp (and Amazon recently took a stand against it), and even Yelp is in a unique position to offer ""cleaning"" services to companies that want to remove negative reviews and improve their image.Until the consumer has access to the quality of data with the same level of reliability there won't be parity between consumers and corporations within the system.>Another post mentions an ""information imbalance"". I definitely believe the imbalance is in the consumers favor. We have a huge advantage on data analysis because we know what we want to find.I think 15 years ago this would have been true. With the advances in available computing power and algorithm research that's gone on behind the scenes, paired with the (frankly) obscene amount of metadata available to pull from the corporation/advertising side is much easier than it used to be. At this point the consumer is at a decided disadvantage against the top tier tools, so it becomes a question of who has access to the necessary tools (or the money to pay for access). Those that do have an easier time establishing and maintaining market dominance, possibly to the detraction of smaller competitors that might offer a better product. Market forces are subverted by this kind of technology, and it's the consumer who loses.>I don't believe it's quite that easy and also believe these companies are soon going to be talking about some of the principles of quantum physics with their attempts to measure this stuff (ie you influence it too much by measuring it).An interesting question, though I think that only becomes an issue if consumers know the kind of questions being asked by marketing and advertising. If those questions become public you might see a backlash against specific types of products, a particular industry, or even an individual company - but it's not going to affect the metadata regarding buying habits.#> Or the local shop charges you more for the fruits and vegetables that you need for the recipe that you had just read in a magazine and decided you want to make.This is just speculation. You can also imagine a world of targeting couponing on specific recipe ingredients to get you in the store (or more likely, buying off Amazon kitchen).#> but then, if you can charge more to people who like black things, it becomes a hot mess of legality and I suspect it wouldn't be as favourable to consumers as we'd want.Why wouldn't you be charging as much as you can for those products *already*?

Due to the Internet, people have *vastly* more resources available than they ever had before. 25 years ago, if you wanted to buy something, the best research you could do was to read about it in consumer reports, go to the store, and hope that they had the CR recommended model. You can still do that...and CR is still a good resource for some things. But you can look at many other resources now. And, more importantly, you have the option to purchase the item online if the B&M store is too expensive or doesn't have what you want. Being able to purchase online is a *huge* shift.>These days, advertisers and others know things about you that YOU don't know about yourself, often quite personal things and they use that knowledge against you.Bullshit.

Including those with low wage jobs overseas and their demand for labor domestically.3) There is no reason that those overseas jobs and wages will generate local jobs.  They would need to last.  They won't  generate more trade demand .. because they are shifting down repeatedly.  Wages are decreasing ... So there is little new benefit from free trade.   (There are shocks if a trade war opens up, but those are indiscriminate).4) If wages never go up except in a small and mostly poor area of the world, no demand at home will exist to prevent deflation and liquidity traps.   As it is investment is already decreasing odor the long term.  Why?  No wage increases nor new demand.  No benefit from any increased trade will help.So Mr Z and Mr G are correct.  Free trade has done its job but no new increases will likely help as the consumer class is being depleted evenly.Trade supply either benefits those who consume goods and services with too strong a currency and have too much demand, or it opens up easier access to raw materials.Both are not an issue.#You didn't produce any credible evidence to substantiate those beliefs and claims.#Why would China be poorer-than-ever??

With the advances in available computing power and algorithm research that's gone on behind the scenes, paired with the (frankly) obscene amount of metadata available to pull from the corporation/advertising side is much easier than it used to be.Again, it's like you have no idea how things were even 20 years ago. *At a minimum*, if I'm at a store and am thinking about buying a product, I can check on Amazon to see if they will sell it to me for less. Price is a hugely important factor, and the consumer's ability to instantly price check gives the consumer a huge advantage that he never used to have. Advertising - and misleading marketing - is not new. It used to be much more difficult to resist because many people were simply unable to advertise at all. TV ads were very expensive, and newspaper ads large enough to be informative were as well. You could read about products in magazines, and some products in newspapers...but these media were largely beholden to their advertisers.  And - with the notable exception of CR - there weren't really alternate media to get out real information.Things are *much much* better today, even if they aren't perfect. #>No. Just no. Due to the Internet, people have vastly more resources available than they ever had before. They do, potentially. Its still comparatively less than producers can access, and the amount of data producers can access is going up all the time.The difference ofc is that consumers can't hire a professional to sit down with the data and work out the best way to use it to manipulate producers, but producers can and do field whole teams of professionals who spend all day every day working out ways to manipulate the consumer.>If advertisers are lucky, they might know one accurate thing about me that is relevant.

Look at Amazon's recommendations to see just how hit-or-miss that is. Recommendations generally suck...and that's based on a lot of detailed information.There's a crucial difference between Amazon and a standard retailer/company - Amazon doesn't care what you buy as long as you use their service, while a retailer has  a specific product it wants to push. Amazon tailors their recommendations based on what you've been searching and what you've bought, but they don't necessarily recommend specific brands. As a marketplace they instead want to cater to retailers as a place where something for sale can get maximum exposure. As a consumer you're part of the product that Amazon sells as well as part of their audience.>No. This is almost entirely bullshit. It is ridiculous to believe that all information we read is compromised by all powerful corporations. They try to neutralize negative information, and spread FUD, but they are far from entirely successful.So the fact that Amazon has openly been [fighting extensive fake reviews](http://fortune.com/2016/10/27/amazon-lawsuit-fake-reviews/) doesn't mean anything? How about Yelp and their tendency to [charge people](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimhandy/2012/08/16/think-yelp-is-unbiased-think-again/#47b7472e11d1) to remove [poor reviews](http://sfist.com/2014/09/04/yelp_is_allowed_to_manipulate_ratin.php)?As a anecdotal example backing up both of those links about yelp, the last job I worked at was a small mortgage refi company. The owner had spent about $10k over a 2 year period removing bad reviews from yelp *and* unhiding positive reviews.Then there's the ability to [buy upvotes to get a front page post](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5ihyvu/reddit_for_sale_how_we_bought_the_top_spot_for_200/) on reddit. The number of available accounts ready to upvote paid content would seem to indicate a rather large submarket for advertising organically on reddit, and that video only touches one particular set of companies when plenty more exist.I don't sub to /r/HailCorporate but I understand the reason for their existence. Reddit is a huge target for advertisers who want positive coverage. If you don't think it's being manipulated at any kind of scale then you need to do some more research.>The consumers are still ahead  it's not that hard to detect astroturfing, and consumers can also use things like ""fakespot"" to do their own data analysis.Never heard of this until just now, looks interesting.And honestly if fake news and reviews were that easy to notice then something like Fakespot wouldn't be necessary, Trump wouldn't be president, and the UK would have voted to remain in the EU. I think the evidence is stacked against your assertion that it isn't that big of a deal.>Again, it's like you have no idea how things were even 20 years ago. I said 15 years ago for a reason, that's right around the end of the tech bubble. That's when Google (and their search algorithms) started to become the major players in online search, and as a result in online advertising as well. What I said was that the ability of companies to push marketing into every corner of the internet didn't exist then due to technical limitations, not lack of desire to do so.>At a minimum, if I'm at a store and am thinking about buying a product, I can check on Amazon to see if they will sell it to me for less. Price is a hugely important factor, and the consumer's ability to instantly price check gives the consumer a huge advantage that he never used to have.Most people don't do this, or if they do they're going to trust the reviews they see on Amazon or Google rather than question them. Again, if fake reviews were so easily spotted then they would also be easily marked for removal as fake both by users and by Amazon/Google. These companies are attempting to improve their image that they see as having been tarnished by fake reviews.>Advertising - and misleading marketing - is not new. It used to be much more difficult to resist because many people were simply unable to advertise at all. TV ads were very expensive, and newspaper ads large enough to be informative were as well. You could read about products in magazines, and some products in newspapers...but these media were largely beholden to their advertisers. And - with the notable exception of CR - there weren't really alternate media to get out real information.There's definitely a difference in terms of who has access to be able to advertise, but the major problem is variable access to different qualities of advertising. Whereas before you knew you were getting an advertisement for a product (or at least one particular source on a review that you could choose to trust or not), now advertising attempts to disguise itself as a real review (the ""organic advertising"" model). As I said before, companies that have access to the most powerful tools and can spend money across multiple advertising firms have an insane reach into the deep corners of the internet.Working as a cloud server engineer I see this technology in use almost every day, not to mention the recruiter emails that come in several times a day looking for big data engineers to work for marketing firms. It's now about a question of who has data about you (like Facebook, Google, etc.) and how useful that data is as a product for companies.>Things are much much better today, even if they aren't perfect.In some ways they certainly are, but I think that fake reviews (and news) have caused a larger problem than you're willing to admit to.#> we will invest in a startup which makes autos which don't do the chip, and take advantage of massively undercutting all the other auto-makers who do, and who now have captive consumers who want out of the deal after they realize how much it allows gas stations to take advantage of them.In a world where self driving vehicles are the norm, like I was saying, doing this would be prohibitively expensive in terms of both time and money. You would need to replicate many years of intensive research and development without violating existing patents. A startup is not going to be able to make it happen, only a large, established company could hope to do it, just like a startup is not going to be able to successfully launch an entirely new commercial computer or mobile operating system, game console, credit card or cell service provider, except probably even more difficult than any of those things.Also, at that point I would expect companies running gas station chains etc. to collude against this by making the price for consumers who do not provide data artificially high.>And anyway, I personally know enough people, who like myself, hate and don't use facebook, that if the world somehow really came down to zero car-makers who don't embed the devil chip[](https://www)>And at that point, who are we to say that these people don't value what they get in return for allowing the chip, more than they value the previously lower prices.I don't use facebook either, but of course I still use multiple tracked services (including very likely this one). It is the norm, it's expected  there are people who are turned down by employers for not having facebook accounts. I wouldn't say consumers are allowing it if it is the only practical choice. Imagine someone trying to get by without a cell phone  in the past they would have had the option of using a pay phone, but all the pay phones have been torn down since everyone is expected to have a cell phone. How often is the answer to a question 'just google it'? Google Search is another service that tracks your data and provides it to advertisers, but it has become an essential part of modern life, and its competition is steadily dying out.#You conveniently missed>This makes pure natural monopolies very rare, but they do exist, and most often as a single player in an industry. But just because a company operates as a natural monopoly does not explicitly mean it is the only company in the industry.and>Companies that realize a natural monopoly sometimes exploit the benefits. For example, monopolies can restrict supply of a good or service, thus inflating prices. A railroad company can increase freight prices or increase the prices of passenger tickets since it is the only company offering this type of transportation. #I just looked around and unless i missed it I cannot find an easy graph of consumer spending that (1) accounts for population growth and (2) even has constant dollars.The stagnation of wages versus other costs (health, education, housing) make the net deflated value (I'm pretty sure) a big problem.The reason I generalize is that said free trade and oversupply-powered low inflation is becoming a devastating problem inany countries.Lower prices don't help someone with a worse job and fewer assured wages to count on.  Gen Y is very bad that way.#Average wealth is not the same as median wealth ... and that average wealth can go overseas.   It evades taxes.

Modern economics is not classical economics.> There are many many schools .. and genuinely ... truly ... and really... they do not predict the bubbles that keep coming. The Great Recession was a vast vast failure of economics. Yes. It's that bad.Classical economics is not the modern economic model. It hasn't been the dominant economic model since sometime before World War II.Modern economic models do take into account the idea that bubbles happen and that recessions happen. Heck, even classical economics did.""But why didn't they predict the Great Recession?""First off, a number of people did in fact predict the Great Recession.So why didn't everyone predict it?There's a [well known graph](https://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch7en/conc7en/img/stages_bubble.png) that shows how bubbles generally work. [Here's a comparison of the 1980 gold bubble to the 2000 Nasdaq bubble.](http://www.itulip.com/images/goldVSnas.jpg) You can see the similar shapes. A lot of bubbles follow this general form.Some bubbles are obvious - beanie babies are a good example of such. A lot of people recognized it as a bubble and stayed out, some people tried playing suckers, and a lot of people bought in and lost a bunch of money.The reason why some bubbles are hard to predict, however, is because in the real world, the early stages of a bubble can also look like competition over an increasingly scarce and valuable resource (such as, say, land in the middle of a city). Remember, the housing bubble primarily and most heavily affected certain urban areas which had limited space to develop in.This is the trap. If there's a scarce resource being competed over, and it is genuinely scarce, you can end up with big increases in prices over pretty short periods of time.This is why it is hard to predict a bubble well in advance - generally speaking, it only becomes clear that a bubble is a bubble when it is well underway, as it becomes clear that prices don't closely resemble reality. Moreover, a lot of non-experts will talk about what an awesome time it is to invest in (thing X), and thus people like yourself, who lack any expertise whatsoever, will gullibly believe that these people actually know what they're talking about.The reason why economists aren't all rich is because economics is very much a probability driven thing which contains a lot of hidden information. When the information is not hidden, and the probabilities become clear, then the number becomes the market consensus - and at that point, there's little money to be made on it.In other words, economics more or less functions at the speed of the actual market, which means that if you want to get ahead of the market and make money, you have to make bets and guesses based on incomplete information. It is hard to make money listening to economists, because everyone who knows economics can do those calculations and do that analysis. You have to do it faster than the economic consensus - which requires you to take risks.> always assume that ""interference"" is the only cause of disruptionThe thing is, this isn't necessarily wrong.People lying en masse about their ability to pay, people fixing real estate prices, people distorting land use laws, ect. are all forms of interference. And indeed, all of these things played a role in the mortgage crisis.A free market is an idealized model, and every competent economist knows this. IRL, markets are never truly free, and there's a lot of things which cause market distortions.So-called ""free market fundamentalists"" are people who basically cargo cult economics. They don't really understand it at all. If you believe that people are *actualy* rational actors all the time, you're an idiot who didn't study properly.The problem is that human behavior is very complicated, and even in times when something doesn't seem like rational self interest, it actually can be *percieved* as rational self interest from the actors in play, based on the infromation that they have. Indeed, one of the problems with bubbles is that a lot of the people who buy into them believe they are behaving rationally - the problem is that incomplete and incorrect information leads them to the wrong conclusion.---The biggest problem with economics is the fact that it is not something which readily lends itself to experimentation.Macroeconomics is basically immune to running controlled experiments - you just can't do it. People aren't willing to be part of a ""control"" or ""experimental"" group, so the only way that economists can observe anything is to see what people do and then note what the effect was.They can make predictions, and some of those predictions are quite good - even classical economics saw many of the flaws in socialism back in the 19th century, and it turned out that the economists were right that socailism doesn't function. People foolishly tried to put it into practice, and it failed, time and again, in the ways predicted, as well as in ways that were traditionally seen as outside of the domain of economics.Economists make use of some markets - like looking at MMORPG markets - to get at least some experimental data about very different conditions. And they can look at various countries and look at what the general effects are.But giving a specific answer to what seems like a simple question - like ""How will raising minimum wage effect the economy?"" - is actually ridiculously difficult. There are all sorts of models you can used, many of which are in fact in part derived from or checked against real world data. There are numerous economic papers about whether or not raising minimum wage had an effect on such and such a region.There are some things which are clearly good, and which economists can tell you are good, like free trade. Time and again, it has proven itself to be beneficial, and indeed, it is beneficial for exactly the reasons why economists would *predict* it to be good.But a lot of specifics are a lot harder to nail down. Economists can tell you that there is such a thing as too low of a tax rate or too high of a tax rate, but they cannot tell you what those numbers are. Likewise, they will have to tell you that your tax rate has to be proportional to a large number of other things, including wants and needs.I mean, at the very core of economics is value, and *value is subjective*. Value is not something which exists in the universe  it is a human invention. It is based on certain empirical factors, but ultimately value is ""what people are willing to give up in exchange for something (or in order to retain something)"". And that isn't some empirical thing, that's based on human psychology, which isn't terribly well understood.Looking at big things is useful because it allows you to average out minor person-to-person fluctuations. But it also means you're still dealing with it, just more abstractly.Economics is far from perfect as a scientific field. It isn't in the same dire straits as sociology, let alone some of the liberal arts like English or Gender Studies, but it is fair to say that it isn't empirical enough at times.But the argument that there isn't a lot of views on economics isn't really correct. It is probably correct that a lot of economists treat their way as the right way, which isn't surprising, given that, you know, they wouldn't believe what they did if they didn't think it was correct. But it can be problematic.That said, I've not felt like my own economics education was stunted by teachers who didn't talk about various models for things. Some people surely have shitty teachers, but I didn't feel like I was subjected to such.I was always made aware of the limitations of economics, and I've always been aware of the limitations while reading. The problem is that many people - such as yourself - believe that economics can give you concrete predictive answers well in advance, which is simply not something it is capable of doing. But a lot of the reasons why have nothing to do with economic models and everything to do with real-world limitations. If you don't have the information you need, it doesn't matter how good your model is. And sometimes that data simply does not exist yet, because the only place in which they diverge is further on down the line.Look at present day housing prices, for instance. I feel that they're a bubble, and indeed, they match the pattern of a bubble (in fact, some have even argued that [the mortgage crisis was just the bull trap, and we're still in the same long-term bubble](http://rationalradical.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Australian-Housing-Bubble-1999-2015.png)). But I'm not 100% certain of that fact, because it is possible other factors (such as market manipulation) are at work, and we may see sustained high prices as long as said market manipulation continues.#> but just because you refuse to imagine solutionsMy point isn't that we're doomed, it's that this is a problem that won't be solved by doing nothing. Consumer choice and impractical startup ideas are not a realistic safeguard against a situation where companies can abuse their growing access to personal information.#I've made it into a more complete answer.#https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/US_Real_Household_Median_Income_thru_2014.pngThese are constant dollars.   It has grazed upwards but I have two things I lay as a thesis that would need better proof, but the contra-positive is *also* in need of better proof (i.e. that things are hunky dory and better).Firstly, Inflation as a consumer-from-wages is understated for much of the USA.  That is,  (1) health care and education are more significant to the middle class, (2) their increase has created a much higher inflation rate, (3) many areas under influence of rent increases also add to the higher inflation rate, (4) areas simultaneously without consistent rent increases are consistently without increases in wages.So the net inflation on the ""median American"" is actually higher than in the constant-dollar graph.   This is the ""gofundme-so-I-don't-die"" and ""i-will-never-pay-off-student-loans"" pair of generations.   Lastly, a new generation of Baby-Boomers with debt and costly health care is starting to become poor.  My own mom is one of them.My second thesis is that the ""dollar"" is almost best considered two different currencies.   One is international and exists almost outside the GDP because it relates only to temporary debt and security transactions of an incredibly huge speculation economy.   These are nearly untaxable and often never add to any long-term capital or property.   They do figure in the GDP ... but the vast vast number of ""failures that help advance us"" of Oil / Tech / Real-Estate are counted as losses but much of their spending is lost from any long-term value.  It's very strange ... but this ""finance dollar"" is inflating madly and causes connected valuations to go sky-high, but does not directly link to the ""wage dollar"" that is in a huge demand/velocity slump.   One is deflating.  The other is inflating.So as regards the Tech economy, I can assure you that all the innovation that ""The Internet"" did was over by about 2005, after the bubble burst.   A number of lifestyle changes (remote work, mail-order boom, on-demand video) that are now very much a cheaper and luxurious lifestyle, are real.  No doubt.   However we are starting to see the cost from those.   Retail is collapsing in a shockingly large way.   The ""Gig"" economy is efficient to the point of poverty and food stamps for all involved.  News as an industry is collapsing due to redundancy and being automated.   All of these are a natural progression from ""Advances"" .... but they offer only as an advance the glut of advertising techniques.   That is in a bubble state and will collapse too, as there's no added demand for *real* goods and services that hundreds more advertising venues will offer.In short .. we have gluts on all sides that will *shrink* the economy because it has saturated all demand for entertainment / effective-advertising competition and personal communication.   This is the other shoe dropping.So ... the wage-based dollar is only going to get more and more deflation (just as the rest of the world has been fighting, with Japan in the lead).   This is the demolition of the Middle Class as a pattern.It is a long term pattern ... but just as an entire town cannot ""give each other rides"" or ""mow each other's lawns"" in order to create wealth, we cannot have a society that survives on student loans, gig jobs, missing retail stores and call centers.   All of those are wages lost as they don't gain enough to add compensation that can pay increased rent, health care and even stable food prices.Meanwhile we chase shadows because the finance-dollar is flowing and flowing (with help, the best they can, from the Fed and overseas investors) ... and it doesn't create demand.We are in the USA's phase of the Japanese lost-decade .... and though we *are* very much in growth, the debt is going to overhang because later wages are arriving only for the top 20% and much of those are finance-dollar flows.At least ... that's my way to interpret the data: the wage economy with modern advances is due for a deeper collapse.   The Great Recession was a symptom of a larger problem: dropping wage-based demand  ---> no genuine investment opportunities ---> useless speculation investments ---> bubble-only economic activity ---> stagnation.The contrapositive is ""there *is* middle class and widespread growth"" caused by ""genuine productivity increases that advance the standard of living for average Americans as well as the top-1%"".   I say *that* cannot be proven consistently as debt / stagnant-wages and other cost increases make it difficult to even partly accept.#Great! Do something. There will be money to be made if this does indeed become a problem, and you'll help a lot of people if it is so general a problem.If you want to propose political solutions...well, then it's my turn to bombard you with all the things that can and will go wrong using those means, and how they will externalize negatively.#> it's that this is a problem that won't be solved by doing nothing. It's a *problem* that you made up. And that is completely unrealistic bordering on juvenile. Think about it...how does the gas station advertise the price? How do people react when they have to pay a different price? Probably by boycotting gas stations that do this. In case you haven't notice, people are irrationally price sensitive when it comes to gas.#Why didn't you just ask about the downsides of monopoly if you wanted a different answer?#Oh summer child. You have bought into the Big Lie. The idea of ""real dollars"" is utter bullshit. Anytime anyone tells you this, *they're lying*. There's no such thing.Here's a question:Did the average person in 1985 have a tablet?A smart phone?A cell phone?A PC?A high speed Internet connection?What was their TV like? How big was it? What was its resolution?How was their car? What was its mileage? What features did it have?How big was their house?How were their appliances?The list *does* go on, but here's the question:Do the improvements in all of those things, and the presence of all of those things, equate to a difference of only $8k/year?The reality is that the idea of ""adjusted for inflation"" is a lie. There are multiple inflationary indicies. Not only do people cherry-pick the highest of those, but they simply don't accurately measure inflation at all.IRL, people are vastly richer than they were in 1985. If you have 1985 quality stuff today, you would be considered to be poor as shit and horribly outdated.So how can someone in 1985 be making so close to modern wages?They can't.The reality is that the cause is simply that people are lying about it in order to manipulate people.If you use IPD instead, you find that compensation has risen by 77% since 1975.But the reality is that no inflationary index actually is designed to measure decade to decade inflation, and so every time someone tries to do such calculations, they're using the numbers for something they were never designed to deal with in the first place.The idea that people aren't getting richer over time is the Big Lie.IRL, people have gotten vastly wealthier.Disagree?Then never use anything made after 1985.Which includes Reddit, so you can't argue with me anymore.#> There will be money to be made if this does indeed become a problemThere is far more money to be made by creating the problem.#Because I already have an idea on what the answer was.In addition, my question was ""why wouldn't they charge monopoly prices"", a complete answer to that would include second bit about inflating prices through the restriction of supply. #> The idea of ""real dollars"" is utter bullshit.You're talking about one of the most fictional concepts that's ever taken over the earth.   You know ""dollars"" are a fiat and a concept that relates (via linear algebra) to tons and tons of goods.   You think it is a ""constant""?   Like ""gold"" ... that has fallen in and out of favor and oscillated all over the map?So you *really* think all-is-well is a thesis you can stick with, because ... YOU are wowed as an end consumer?   You don't know what competition is?   You don't know about the ""arms race"" of spending in marketing?   You don't know about overseas changes and disruption of entire careers?  You assume that any careerist with moderately new clothes in any area of the world .... is vastly wealthy and should thank his lucky stars.    Even if he has no work and competition has driven his company out of business?If they cannot marry because of wage issues.  Cannot buy a car because their normal income and credit is out of reach.  Cannot own property that his parents could easily buy.  Cannot go to school without a multi-decade debt?You ... really assume that the cheap nugget of silcon made in China is somehow a recompense?   A cheap TV?   Cheap TV shows?   Cheap websites?  Cheap News?   Cheap broadband (instead of high-powered TV broadcasts) .... are it?Then explain to me how Bangladesh and other places can have food riots, but cellphones?   How is it that we can see slavery on the rise in SE Asia?   How is it that the problems with climate and the rest .... seem to drive many in the third world (with degrees from Universities overseas) ... toward poverty and even, in ever-corrupt governments ... toward extremism.You are sure that all-is-well at all times, when every measure of all the experts is that there's something that vastly changed since about 1972?That's just an old fart talking who cares nothing for any but his barcalounger ... and has no idea what poverty even is.#If you say so.#> You think it is a ""constant""?No. I expressly said otherwise, in fact.However, I was pointing out that he idea of ""real dollars"" is utter bullshit, because it implies that they are really measurable. They're not. Measuring inflation is incredibly difficult and the idea that you can condense it down to ""real dollars"" is a fallacy  it doesn't really work that way. The world doesn't work that way.> You don't know what competition is?Competition is good. Only evil people are opposed to it.Competition says that if someone else can do something better than you for less, they win out. That is good for everyone except for you. Any other result is bad for everyone except for you.Thus, the world is always best when there is a lot of active competition. Competition makes things cheaper and more efficient, makes things less corrupt, ect.> You don't know about overseas changes and disruption of entire careers?You don't have a right to force someone else to employ you.Employment is a voluntary contract  you supply labor to someone, they supply you with money. Just like buying something, except they're buying your time and effort instead of a product (though, in the end, all products are nothing more than time and effort put into them). If someone else can do it better, why should you get the job instead of them?You shouldn't.Competition is good for everyone from all angles, except for corrupt people. Corrupt people - evil people - hate competition, because they want to divert resources towards themselves at the expense of the rest of society. They don't want to have to earn stuff, they want to be able to monopolize stuff and charge whatever they want for it.Abusing a monopoly in order to jack up prices on people is bad.> If they cannot marry because of wage issues.Getting married doesn't cost anything. In fact, cohabitation saves money - you don't have to buy as much stuff, you can split rent, ect. The idea that people ""cannot marry"" because of wage issues is pure nonsense.> Cannot buy a car because their normal income and credit is out of reach. You'd have to be ridiculously poor in the US to be unable to afford a car. My parents recently sold a car they'd driven a fair bit for $2k. Someone got a nice (if heavily driven) hybrid electric SUV for that much.Even someone making minimum wage can afford that.> Cannot go to school without a multi-decade debt?This is The Big Lie. Median student debt amongst those who have student debt at all is only about $12,000. Most people don't have multi-decade debt. If you do, it is because you're being dumb, not because that's normal. I graduated from a top-tier university with $12k in debt, and that was normal for my peer group.The people who end up super deep in debt are people who are going to extremely expensive  private universities which aren't particularly good and doing so without any sort of scholarship money. It is dumb to do. You cannot protect people from their own stupidity.Sometimes medical and law school students rack up a fair bit of debt as well being in school for absolute ages, but they earn quite a lot of dosh after graduating, so it isn't a ""multi-decade"" debt for them either.> Cannot own property that his parents could easily buy.You can buy property in lower-density areas for very affordable prices. It is mostly places which are vastly overcrowded which have ridiculous housing prices, and that is mostly because of regulations which prevent competition.> You ... really assume that the cheap nugget of silcon made in China is somehow a recompense? A cheap TV? Cheap TV shows? Cheap websites? Cheap News? Cheap broadband (instead of high-powered TV broadcasts) .... are it?Yes. That stuff is awesome and people want it.> Then explain to me how Bangladesh and other places can have food riots, but cellphones? Why are you lying?I'm curious here.Here's a big paper about them: http://foodriots.org/publication/view/the-food-riots-that-never-were-the-moral-and-political-economy-of-food-security-in-bangladeshThe reality is that ""food riots"" are typically not actually such, and most such things are typically protests over the rising price of food as a result of food shortages, typically a result of distribution networks breaking down or local shortages requiring food to be imported from elsewhere. A lot of them have to do with governmental stuff as well - the role of the government in stabilizing food prices.The argument ""But they have cellphones!"" is a total nonsequitor. People have houses, too. Why don't they eat them?The answer, obviously, is that houses are a durable good. So are cell phones.Food, on the other hand, is perishable and has to be shipped around and distributed constantly.If you have a cell phone shortage, what happens? Nothing, really. People are inconvenienced. But you don't need a cell phone *right now*.You do need food right now, so food shortages are a much bigger deal.It is very easy to buy a cell phone when things are good, and then to still have it when things are bad. Cell phones are not particularly expensive, either - the idea of them being some sort of expensive luxury item is nonsense and is terribly outdated. A normal cell phone is extremely cheap.Food shortages are temporary things brought on by disruptions - they're aberrations from the norm. And indeed, ""food shortages"" really are nothing more than food squeezes - it isn't that there isn't enough food, it is that the food is more expensive due to various factors. Famines are extremely rare and are mostly caused by armed conflict these days - breakdowns in ability to import food - as the world has enough food. But if you have to import stuff from elsewhere, it can be more expensive as a result as you're having to divert it from other things, ship it further, buy different products, ect.It is easy for places to have lots of durable goods and to have a temporary food shortage that drives up prices temporarily. The fact that they have cell phones or houses or whatever is really irrelevant - they need that food *now* and the price of getting it *now* is more than it would be later.> How is it that we can see slavery on the rise in SE Asia?It isn't.> How is it that the problems with climate and the rest .... seem to drive many in the third world (with degrees from Universities overseas) ... toward poverty and even, in ever-corrupt governments ... toward extremism.It has nothing to do with those things. Extremism has always been common. Look at communism. Before that, look at religion.It is nothing new. Modern extremism is not something people are being driven to, it is a result of people being jerks.> You are sure that all-is-well at all times, when every measure of all the experts is that there's something that vastly changed since about 1972?Yes. As every *expert* agrees, people are massively wealthier.#I described why I think so earlier, you never addressed it. Kind of pointless to just state claims about how things are without going any further.#All you've proven to me is that information is your enemy, like in a cult.  More of it ... you have to stop and stop it quickly, or you'll question if you are so certain.Starts with the Mises ideal that ""we don't know what demand and supply are really so we don't know currency comparative values over time"" and from there.There's no excuse.  There's no hope for someone who thinks some simple linear algebra is somehow a ""mistake"" or a ""hoax"".#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection###Psychological projectionPsychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. For example, a person who is habitually rude may constantly accuse other people of being rude. It incorporates blame shifting.According to some research, the projection of one's unconscious qualities onto others is a common process in everyday life.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Economics/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.2"

Thank you /u/kishi for arranging this AMA and the /r/startup sub-reddit for allowing this AMA to be hosted here.In addition, I've asked /r/CyberByte to join us. He is a very intelligent and knowledgeable AI student/researcher and will lend us more technical information and business cases that I won't know. AI is a huge field. He recently was asked by others and myself to join the /r/artificial moderation team and he has accepted and we are all very pleased about it.**Some AI Definitions*** **ML (Machine Learning)** ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)) - Is the sub-field of computer science that, according to Arthur Samuel in 1959, gives ""computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.""  Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence, machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a model from sample inputs. - Wikipedia* **AI (Artificial Intelligence)** ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)) - Intelligence that is artificially created by humans using computers.* **Weak AI / Narrow AI / ""applied ML"" / ""specialized ML""** ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_AI)) - This AI type is the general type that currently exists for the most part.

It is used to develop useful tools that can help solve domain-specific problems we have today.* **Strong AI / True AI / AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)** ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)) - This is an AI that is capable of operating in all domains that it is given to operate within such as a human does.  This does not exist yet but is a goal to achieve. For startups I would typically not recommend it, and if they are going to pursue AGI, they need to do it in a way that also yields some shorter-term results.* **ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence)** ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence)) - An AGI variation that is much more powerful than regular AGI with some theory being that it will operate differently than standard human intelligence because it goes way past standard AGI capabilities . The idea being that an AGI will be able to reprogram itself to be an ASI. *Lot of discussion about what this type of AI is defined as or if it needs distinction from AGI at all.***Mainstream AI Creations, Products, and Services*** **DeepMind** ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind)) - Google's Deepmind, has beaten the best Go player using it's AlphaGo program in 2017.

It might be worth looking at.**What AI Can/Can't Do**Quick AI + Human Relation OverviewHumans have a few factors in what we use to compute information. For instance we can only hold around 7 +/-2 data points at once within our mind such as tracking roughly 7 +/-2 people in a video. ([more about the ""magical number""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two))Humans also have a limited mental framerate/processing rate that a computer can blow out of the water. Humans can only remember x amount of data points at one time unless you have a very very special brain like that one guy that looks at a landscape, looks away, and then paints a photo-realistic replica of that scene.So a computer can basically just do way way more of what a person can do as the factors can be increased in ability. Like you are getting at though, it isn't magic, it's just more of what a human can do in various aspects. More sample sets, etc.The current state of ML is basically heavy duty stereotyping which is basically a thing called Prototype Theory in action using powerful statistical modeling which is what the subconscious of a person generally does without the person being aware of how that data is all being processed. Basically, current weak AI and the possible/eventual strong AI systems are not magic and are artificial representations of various capability levels of human intelligence from the simplest to most complex.Don't get me wrong though, powerful statistical modeling can get you quite far with giant big data sets of information. Current weak AI suffers from the problem of having to be given labeled data to learn from and the more complex of a piece of data, the more likely it is to not understand it well.**Some General Current Uses of AI**In the past AI was used for fun and games literally. They used it to play chess players and tinker with some other things. Now they use it for business and making money.* **Cancer screening** - Can more accurately figure out what images show signs of cancer vs doctors because an AI can scan every available cancer screening info and record given to it when a doctor has a limited number of samples he is drawing his conclusions from.* **Behavior tracking** - See who is not supposed to be in your parking garage/office building.* **Insurance** - Who gets denied, cost assessments, etc.* **Article creation and summaries** - Can create simple articles from data sets given to it such as sports. Other bots are able to use AI to create article summaries. These are even on reddit in many sub-reddits for a TL DR kind of overview. (uses fancy language statistical modeling)* **Recommended videos** - Netflix and YouTube use powerful  statistical modeling to figure out what you will want to watch next based on what you have watched, rated, watch time, etc.* **Drive cars** - Google has been working on auto driving cars for a while and has gotten them pretty good at driving. Other companies are working on similar things with similar success for cars and even semi trucks.* **CyberByte additions** - Web search, machine translation, spam filters, personal assistants (like Siri), ad placement (note that Google does all of these, but they're not alone), product/movie/whatever recommendation, vacuum cleaning (Roomba), Facebook's automatic facial recognition/tagging, etc.   Some slightly less mainstream that not everybody works with on a daily basis like general data mining/analysis and business intelligence (threat assessment, anomaly detection, trend analysis, etc.), diagnostic systems, sentiment analysis (e.g. on Twitter for marketing), automatic surveillance, various simulators/forecasts, etc.Basically, if a project can be done using algorithms, heuristics, and statistical modeling, an AI can do it for you if you give it enough labeled sample data to learn from and you've chosen or designed the algorithms, heuristics, and statistical modeling well enough or correctly.**Some Future Uses of AI**The future uses of weak AI are going to be able to automate the most redundant jobs there are. If it does not require creativity, it can do the job basically. Driving cars (Google Cars), making your fast food, helping you with customer support, etc.The problems that cannot be solved with weak AI are basically anything that requires creativity or understanding human nature really well. Weak AI uses algorithms, heuristics, and statistical tools but without layered abstractions of concepts and the ability to work in any knowledge domain you drop it in, it won't be able to do those tasks.When Artificial General Intelligence comes about however, that is when you will be able to do jobs that require cross domain ability that uses human level processes to operate on those cross domain pieces of information. Basically what people call creativity.It will then be able to take over engineering jobs, science, writing books, music, movies, etc. A video called [Everything Is A Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc) explains a bit about this abstraction to creation process.Additionally, if you'd like to see some views on automation on how it has effected the economy and will affect it in the future see this new video by Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell. [**The Rise of the Machines - Why Automation is Different this Time**](https://youtu.be/WSKi8HfcxEk)**What sorts of problems are impossible with AI**Some problems however cannot be solved with AI. It can't predict things when it doesn't have all the pieces of information that the prediction scenario exists in. It can't tell you when you are going to die or who you will fall in love with or what the weather will look like in 1 year accurately and precisely. If your problem falls into the following cases, you won't likely be able to us AI to complete the task you want it to solve.Three Scenarios AI Likely Won't Work1. Not enough information2. Too many data points - Massive sets of data or massive quantities of search paths to solve a problem will leave you with an incalculable problem to conclude accurately.3. Chaos effect - Tiny minute factors influencing each other to create a massive web of calculations that basically are incalculable.Then there is a P vs NP problem that has a whole mess of information tied to it. Suggest you just watch this video on it: [P vs. NP and the Computational Complexity Zoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX40hbAHx3s)Three P vs NP Problems Examples* Multiplication - linear progression of time/steps to solve and solution can be checked accurately* Sudoku - polynomial progression of time/steps to solve and solution can be checked accurately* Chess - non-deterministic polynomial progression of time/steps to ""solve"" and ""solution"" cannot be checked accurately**What should startups be focusing on, vis a vis AI?**1. Find situations where powerful statistical modeling can be utilized and doesn't require understanding the data like a human does such as biology or emotions.  There are many situations that you can apply AI to, but remembering that weak AI basically uses powerful and clever [algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpXaH77B8xg) such as statistical modeling, search, planning, constraint satisfaction, various kinds of reasoning, and even some computer vision and natural language processing, will help. [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and [Monte Carlo](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm) algorithms are two excellent examples of both processes and statistical modelings being joined together to perform tasks very powerfully. Even AlphaGo the Go playing system used statistical modeling but with Monte Carlo tree search to make shorter predictions because of the sheer quantity of routes it would have to predict and check. Just not enough computing power available and is predicted never will be available.2. Like with AlphaGo, any advancements in the actual statistical abilities of weak AI must be modified from the standard shallow level stereotyping/statistical methods to a more robust multi-leveled conceptual abstraction method that has time/processing limits on each branch.  More similar to how a human is capable of doing things without zoning out for a day at a time. You can always go back and check the assumptions made with the predictions so that future predictions will be more powerful/capable.Three key areas to remember to focus on improving and implementing in weak AI: Algorithms, statistical modeling methods, and heuristics. Humans use a massive amount of heuristics to get by and do well.##Question Time**NOTE:** Will start answering after a bunch of questions are asked at earliest and Tues 4pm PST at latest.There are many types of questions you can ask in this AMA. While I'm more of a hyper abstract/fringe AI researcher that goes deep into philosophy/psychology/logic/systems design, you will get more technical coding and mainstream academic answers from CyberByte. I do have some academic answers as well, as that is a bit required to get to the fringe.Quick note about the philosophy bit... philosophy is the source of calculus, biology, psychology, and science in general.

Thanks in advance! #What are your thoughts on Azure as a tool and what limitations would most people overlook?#[deleted]#Short answer: YesLong answer: There are many AI services currently and that will come on line as time progresses that are more user friendly to plug into. Much like how [IFTTT]( https://ifttt.com/) made it easy to interface many disconnected services together.You’ve got facial recognition systems, voice recognition systems, image processing, etc.It seems that as with many other software solutions, if you have prebuilt components that can take care of input to output tasks you need, then it will become easier and much more feasible for non-ai software startups to use AI in their startup product. The biggest thing is that you are using the services for doing some kind of information acquisition or information processing. Toss x into one side of the black box and get xyz on the other side of the black box that you can use.The listed Mainstream Creations, Products, and Services links should give you a great idea of what is available to you as just the tip of the iceberg. Lyrebird for instance is a great example of something a bit off brand that allows you to do cool things. More will be coming and any startup that is capable of providing even just little services like that to transform information or do something relating to AI that other software cannot, will likely be able to do well.NOTE: If you want to get fancy with modifications of things like using libraries and such, then you likely will need to do some AI research into what those things are and what they are capable of doing and not capable of doing and how you can achieve those ends you are looking to achieve. #Great question. Are you looking at getting in to this yourself? I'm currently working on a small service (won't really scale) that makes use of logistic regression using freely available libraries. The tools do a great job but the stumbling block for me so far has been explaining how machine learning is doing its predictions to non-nerds (old school marketing people) . It would be great to have someone on my team that could explain machine learning in layman's terms to potential customers of my service. I'm not 100% sure if that person would need a PhD but they'd definitely need to be able to answer really random questions from laymen. Hope this helps contribute to the answer that you're seeking, somehow. #I think there are a lot of companies out there who have some low-hanging fruit that could be plucked with fairly standard applications of existing AI tools. You would have to be an expert in recognizing these (business) opportunities, knowing your (tools') limitations, and using that tool. So I think you could have a profitable business without being an AI expert. However, I suspect that sooner or later you (or your clients) would like to take things a bit further, and then you would probably need an AI/ML expert to modify the tool and either tailor it to each client's specific needs, or to exploit patterns/regularities you've found in your experience in working with these companies. #> 1) What's the consensuses on when strong AI comes about, giving it access to the internet? Will it almost immediately bring about super AI?I wouldn't say there is much consensus about what will happen when somebody invents strong AI / AGI. There are a number of ways in which an [""intelligence explosion""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_explosion) could possibly happen. For instance, the AI could gain massively more hardware (processing power and memory) or knowledge, or it could recursively improve its own algorithms (e.g. if its a better AGI researcher than its creators). Certainly it would seem that connecting the system to the internet could help with all of these: maybe it could take over other connected computers (e.g. by hacking or paying for them) to get more hardware, or maybe it could incorporate all of the internet's information into its knowledge base, or maybe it could do better AGI research by finding articles and experimenting with copies of itself. Furthermore, access to the internet potentially increases the number of ways in which the world can be affected, and if the AI can make copies of itself, it would be very difficult to delete all of them. But all of this depends on the architecture of the AGI, and we currently don't know how best to achieve it. One possibility is that it will be a whole-brain emulation, in which case it would probably be highly similar to humans. With human reading speed, processing speed and memory capacity, we might expect that nothing *super* spectacular would happen if it's connected to the internet. Furthermore, just copying the brain may not necessarily mean we understand it, so it may be very difficult to improve upon (aside probably from speeding it up). On the other hand, if the AGI mechanism allows for huge reading speed, processing speed and memory capacity, then maybe it can read, understand and integrate the knowledge of all of Wikipedia in a very short amount of time, which would certainly make it more knowledgeable than any human. Whether all that decalarative knowledge will make it into a ""superintelligence"" instantly is another somewhat open question. For more about this and ""takeoff speed"", I recommend taking a look at /r/ControlProblem's side bar and wiki.> 2) Is there a strong possibility that once super AI is created, that it will be kept from the general public for a long time due to security threats?I'm inclined to say ""yes"". Being in possession of one of the most powerful technology on Earth makes you a potential target, and you can probably reap many of the benefits of having a super AI without revealing that you do. > 3) Being that we're in r/startups, is there a current possibility to take data points from a large number founders and companies with data points ranging from age, gender, profession, education, location of birth, etc and predict chances of success or failure to a certain degree?If you have a lot of this data, I imagine you could make a predictor fairly easily. Some of the variables you mention are almost certainly correlated with success, which could be used to make a reasonable prediction. One question is whether those variables tell the whole story (which affects how accurate you can hope to be),  another is whether you're measuring what you want, and a third is what you do with that information. For instance, if you're a VC who uses this to decide who to invest in, it becomes sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy: if you don't invest in women, then female entrepeneurs won't be (as) succesful, and future data will reflect that, which you may interpret to mean you shouldn't invest in women. Note that such biases probably also exist in the data before you started affecting things yourself. This is what I mean by knowing what you're actually measuring: ""past success"" is not the same as ""people I should invest in"". ##1Strong AI timeline is fuzzy. Many people say it is close, many people say it is about a decade off, many people say a hundred or so years, other people say never will happen. I personally think at the pace we are going and the conversations I’ve had with people working on AGI type projects, and such, I think it is closer than people will feel comfortable with, but that’s just my take on it. The biggest issue is that there is so many methods and theories out there on various sections of what would make up an AGI that it is hard for people to pull together a cohesive set of methods AND have that cohesive set of methods perform as an AGI.There is also two types of AGI where one is much closer. One is not sentient and just solves problems like a scientist would with pure information and not any knowledge of how humans feel or be able to have conversations either. Just a purely cold calculating system. The other is a sentient kind which is further off since it is much more complicated and includes things like self-motivations, emotional processing capabilities, empathy ability, etc. Both suffer from a control problem. The non-sentient kind suffers from the control problem that is easily explained through an example called the paperclip optimizer. The sentient kind is basically about how do you get something with self-motivations to always be good and not try to do terrible things for its own self interests.Will the AGI when created immediately become ASI capable when allowed to interact with the internet and information databases? Yes and no. Depends on how the control problem is solved and what version of AGI it is. You are however getting at a common concept in AI called hard takeoff problem. The idea is that if it can absorb and understand information much faster and better than a person can, then it would just absorb all of the data gathered from places like Wikipedia, Standford college lectures, the library of congress, etc. and then basically be a man made god. I personally believe that is exactly how it will happen, but others disagree. There is a factor however of how fast it can digest the information and in what order. Information changes depending on what information you learn first. Just look at how people are taught from a child’s age and how they are basically impenetrable as adults to change to a different set of viewpoints. It’s a lot like trying to start off with an internal combustion engine and turn it into an electric drive engine. So many components have to be swapped out, etc. Humans have all kinds of mental defenses so that they aren’t easily manipulated and changed every day. It allows a person to be at least somewhat consistent. A sentient AGI or even a non-sentient one would likely possess the same resistance.When it comes to an AGI transforming how it operates at it’s core to be better than a standard AGI... I sort of get off that ride. It all depends how good or perfected the AGI was in the first place. I mean if you are a low IQ person and find out you can become a high IQ person, then sure, you can make those slight upgrades in processes. Changing to something entirely not human in terms of intelligence processes and logic structures I do not agree with. Information works upon itself in very specific ways. You can’t really perform magic and do something that goes against information theory methods that are possible. Like trying to create your own reality or something equally perceived as irrational.#2It depends on who creates the strong AI. Many people say that the government always is way ahead of the private sector such as 20 years ahead. I don’t believe they would have it yet or war and things would be much different right now. If the public sector or a private citizen/group creates it, I can see it being taken by the government. There is a thing in patent law where if something is going to be good for the government to have or just is dangerous to national security, they make it confidential and then put a gag order on you. There is a lot of debate about what would happen though, but I’ve given my answer to you in this response so far. There is a thread about this here: [LINK]( https://redd.it/3wijx5)#3Sure you could predict things to a certain degree, BUT a person’s personality has a lot to do with if they will succeed in addition to the superficial factors you listed. You’d have to tear apart a person’s personality to a massive degree to achieve gathering hundreds to millions of axioms of a person’s character. Just one factor out of place could throw the entire thing. It’s a lot like that chaos theory point I noted in the main post. It would however be very useful tool to find weak spots and then rank a group of folks based on strong to weak. Sort of like trying to figure out if someone is going to die early. You are less likely to die of natural causes young if you are healthy, but it happens. It generally happens from various minute factors that were unknown to exist or even that they exist. Degrees of precision is important to remember. If you can’t hit a certain threshold of certainty in various scenarios, then it might not be worth it, but other scenarios it might be worth it. Just depends on the scenario.#1) humanity has no idea yet2) likely to be invented publically or in multiple places e.g. no3) of course. prediction quality varies with data, noise, complexity.#I'm really not an expert on marketing, but I get the impression that AI, ML and deep learning are big buzz words now, so using them is probably a good idea. ""smart"" sounds great too. As always, you should know your audience. I think that for low-stakes applications marketed at lay people, it's probably best to explain things in spectacular, flashy and vague terms where you can probably sound fairly human-centric (e.g. make comparisons to human intelligence / the brain) and up the sci-fi factor. Just make sure it doesn't sound creepy (""every breath you take, every move you make, the AI will be watching you""). Probably avoid Terminator/HAL 9000 imagery. For risk-averse audiences, you probably want to make it sound progressive, but well-understood, but not sci-fi and mysterious, so maybe it's better to say you used advanced math to fit a statistical model that detects patterns in their data (or something).#> As an entrepreneur and an AI researcher, do you think startups can effectively market ML to consumers? Yes, but it depends on what the product/service is. For instance Google has email, IFTTT has service/product connection, etc. Just like with anything sufficiently complicated, you either have to simplify it to sell it to mainstream folks or have to have capable tech folks use your more complex solutions. > Large companies like Apple and Amazon tend to market products as ""smart"" to avoid terms like ML, but often times, startups will advertise ML/AI as a feature of their products. How do you think ML concepts should be communicated to the layperson?It really depends on your audience. For people that know your thing is gimmicky they will see it as gimmicky. If the people see it as a legitimate AI product or service then you are all good. Some companies are trying to market themselves as having AI tech in their product but it is just a simple algorithm or two that isn't really at all AI or even ML. That ""crying wolf"" concept is going to get off putting very quickly unless people start using it correctly and ostracize those that do not.For most people in mainstream, they freak out being told something is AI as they think of things like Toy Soldiers or some other AI scifi movie that is going to get them when they are least suspecting it.  Knowing your audience is very important.> Do you think that the ""trendiness"" of ML is a business advantage right now?I think the trend of AI and ML being more mainstream these days at least in the tech community is a good advantage for startups. It isn't as alien as it would have been 10 years ago. So now it is a cutting edge thing instead of a ""I think it was aliens"" kind of thing. Similar to the previous section of answers for this comment, knowing your audience is massively important. When to minimize the alien components and when it is seen as valid and cutting edge and therefor the next valuable thing is important to be capable of doing. Like when you are in an office job trying to sell your boss on an idea you don't sell them the tech parts that they don't understand, you sell them on metrics and factors they understand like profits or cost saving or time savings or something that they can leverage with the marketing department.#Check out /r/artificial's new wiki page on [Getting Started with AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/wiki/getting-started).Short answer: there are a ton of materials out there that are freely available and will help you ""self""-teach. How long it will take depends on what your end goal is. One rule of thumb might be to look at how long it takes university students to get to the level of knowledge/ability you want, and subtract the time it gets them to acquire skills you already have. You may be able to take some short cuts if your goal is more specific than theirs, but they have help and guidance from experts and peers. #Yes, but start from the basics. Get a good grip on statistics first and then move on from there. #Definitely. It depends on if you want to work on theory, mainstream methods, etc. This question is asked a lot over in /r/artificial. Many people reference to check out Standford’s lectures. There are also many other courses and such online you can hunt up.Take a look at the sidebar of /r/artificial to see a few links and resources. I might try to dig up a link later if CyberByte or someone else doesn’t post it. If you search a bit you will find many posts about it there though.#I believe it's possible and I plan to do so myself, and maybe someone can correct me here, but with the amount of courseware available online for free, including programs by major universities it's a matter of finding the time and will - access to learning materials is abundant. When I've lined up a few pieces in my life I plan to start with the algebra, calculus and stats modules on Khan Academy and build my knowledge from there. I'm going right back to the very fundamentals. These branches of mathematics, from what I can gather, form the basis of the knowledge required to work with ML/AI algorithms.#watch the stanford online lectures.#I think this is amazing. APPS are almost a part of a person because it is on the phone that is almost a part of a person. We use the flashlight app to get around in dark and dangerous situations (Like me last night when I thought someone was broken into my dad's apartment and had to go hunting around it in the dark.).Enabling apps to fully utilize all the sensors and cloud capabilities all woven together with AI tools such as visual recognition, audio recognition, etc. that will greatly speed up APP production. Every time that powerful tools are given to the public to use to make stuff, we see a revolution in technology. 3D printers are the best example I have for that. 3D printers used to exist even 20 years ago for engineering firms that had enough money to shell out for one. They used expensive wax, layered paper, powder layering methods, laser sintering, etc. Very expensive but now people can buy a 3D printer, download a copy of Fusion 360 for free, and replace parts on things in their home, vehicle, make new variations of parts, or entirely new products. This speeds up prototyping for inventors like myself who would have had to contract someone to make an expensive prototype. That was very limiting.So in short, this is going to be amazing for startups who want to make powerful awesome and useful or even just fun apps. Before you had to have your own ML or AI team to develop such apps. Now you just use their building blocks and rock out.#I'm not really familiar with Core ML, but I think frameworks like this can make it significantly easier to develop AI-enabled apps, especially for non-experts. This may reduce development/maintenance costs and time. I think this is especially helpful to lightweight startups with not a lot of manpower and (AI) expertise, and for researchers who might like to develop apps, but for whom it would normally be too time-consuming or costly. It also mentions that ""Core ML seamlessly takes advantage of the CPU and GPU"". I don't know it it was previously possible to access these effectively, especially on mobile iOS platforms. If it wasn't, then certain limits on what was possible/feasible for apps to offer will be taken away by Core ML.#will be better at pattern recognition tasks than humans. strong support for doctors. doctors will still be necessary for a lot of human aspects, verification, and for interpretations that need a lot of general knowledge.#> as a doctor and tech enthusiast, i've seen many takes on whether and how effectively AI will be able to replace doctors. what role do you see AI playing in healthcare in the next 5 years? Next 20 years?I talked a bit about the future of the medical field [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/663mtz/what_are_some_objective_telltale_signs_of_a/dgizw6j/) based on some reports I found (and linked). Some quotes from there:> The WEF report seems to think there's a slightly negative (Fig. 11) but stable outlook (page 80) for employment in 2015-2020 (which is worse than other sectors). On the other hand, Frey & Osborne think the ""Healthcare Practitioners and Technical"" group has one of the lowest risks of being computerized (Fig. 3) and PWC says ""education and health and social work are estimated to face the lowest risks of automation"".> ...> But even if [AI technologies] succeed, these technologies are typically aimed at helping medical personnel rather than replacing them. They say ""spend less time searching literature and more time caring for patients"". And I think this is a general trend: there are things that AI will be good at (currently mostly related to narrow-domain analysis and planning) and things that human health professionals are uniquely suited for. And while increased efficiency can also lead to unemployment (i.e. 9 more efficient doctors can maybe do the work of 10 less efficient ones), you also have to take into account whether there is a shortage or overabundance of healthcare. It seems to me that a lot of people are not receiving all the care they want, and that with an aging population, there will be plenty to do in this sector.Another thing I didn't mention there is that current state-of-the-art AI typically can't explain itself and we often don't understand how it makes the decisions it does. This is very undesirable in domains where lives are on the line, like in healthcare. > As a second question, when I look at medical charts, i realize how many errors there are, from outdated information to flat-out incorrect information (example: often times, a patient with type 1 diabetes will accidentally be assigned the diagnosis code for type 2 diabetes, for example). How effective can machine learning be when it is learning from false or inconsistently accurate information?I know there's quite a bit of research on classification with noisy labels, so I think it's definitely a problem, but that there's also some progress on how to deal with it (I don't really know too much about this research though). I've also heard that data availability in some healthcare domains is a big problem. One thing to keep in mind though is that it should presumably be enough for AI methods to do better than doctors, even if some mistakes are made, and doctors are the ones making these mistakes. #> as a doctor and tech enthusiast, i've seen many takes on whether and how effectively AI will be able to replace doctors. what role do you see AI playing in healthcare in the next 5 years?I think people underestimate the need for a human when it comes to healthcare. At least the diagnosis parts. There are so many things about human biology that we don't even know about yet. Many advancements came from doctors noticing something that no doctor had before and then trying something out or even just using an unconventional but effective solution for the scenario.While AI will drastically improve redundant things and even create safeguards against detrimental actions, a doctor is necessary to move the medical field forward. Also, I'm not interested in a machine breaking down or doing some /r/softwaregore when I'm trying to get my health fixed. A patient can generally tell if a doctor is drunk or otherwise impaired. Not so much with a cold robot that has nonsense going on below the surface.AI is excellent for many things, but replacing humans in critical positions is not one of them. We need a person to be the last line of defense. The AI can be an extreme aid to the doctor but not a full on replacement. I mean, if a circuit goes bad, a tiny portion of code gets corrupted, or someone messes up like with Civic where Ghandi turns nuclear when a global value is reduced by 2 and Ghandi was at 1 happens... that would not be good.To be honest, I think any medical thing happening with AI needs to be redundant in parallel and NOT connected. That way if you get equal results or suggestions then you know things are ok. Also we need to be able to see the reasoning pathways and currently most AI is black boxed.> Next 20 years?If AGI comes around and is able to have redudant systems internally that merge only at the end, then maybe, but still I think most people will want a real person. /r/softwaregore is just too much of a look into what could go wrong to allow a machine to fully be in charge of a person's care.Plus... a human won't just stop if an EMP hits.> As a second question, when I look at medical charts, i realize how many errors there are, from outdated information to flat-out incorrect information (example: often times, a patient with type 1 diabetes will accidentally be assigned the diagnosis code for type 2 diabetes, for example). How effective can machine learning be when it is learning from false or inconsistently accurate information?Error fixing and introduction issues are definitely a concern BUT it seems that with the proper coding you could force it to figure out what is error and what is not with enough sample sets to work with. Also you can introduce error sets just to trip it up and see if it catches them. At some point though you have to allow error as NOTHING is perfect, EVER. Even your PC harddrive has production errors that make it so it isn't exactly the size you ordered. Tolerance in production will always be thing as well as in action. Even the FDA allows x parts per million rat hairs and bug parts and such because it is impossible to be hyper perfect.There are methods of figuring out what is an error or not through things like statistical probability. Like if you see a wild spike in a process you are likely to notice that is definitely not supposed to be there. Pattern recognition basically is relatively suited to finding what is supposed to be there or not. Like how a human sees something out of place or probabilistically not supposed to exist.#Self-driving cars have been ""almost there"" for years now, and maybe it will continue to take forever, but I would be very surprised if there wouldn't be a lot of them on the road in 10 years. Driving taxis and trucks will mostly be a thing of the past. I gathered a collection of links to reports on AI and the future of employment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/663mtz/what_are_some_objective_telltale_signs_of_a/dgizw6j/). #Many people say things like medical or personal assistants but I think it will be engineering and science. Those are prime to be overtaken by non-sentient AI that use more powerful processes than current narrow AI. Many people say those aren't going to happen BUT creativity is just a process of abstraction, correlation, connection between abstracted components. The Everything Is A Remix video in the main post covers this concept well.#**Network Security**If you are talking about computer networks in offices and such, I'm not aware of current implementations. However it does seem reasonable that an AI would give you some powerful abilities in network security.* Could figure out when intrusions are happening and then be able to do something about it. Things like create a fake environment and allow the intruder to think it is real. If the government, then anything they try to retrieve could be bugged with malware that would silently give away information about the intruder such as location, other files they have, etc. If not the government then faking an environment may allow them to take fake files thinking they are real all the while alerting security after starting to log details about the intruder.* Could figure out if someone has been stealing files covertly. Admins can track who takes files and when and such but it is easy enough for people to covertly remove files without detection. An AI could provide a much better coverage for this type of file stealing activity.* Could do a better job at protecting against malware and viruses that aren’t currently in the malware/virus protection software that is installed. While not an AI, there is a corporate software that does some pretty fancy stuff similar to what an AI could to. Check them out: [Bromium](https://www.bromium.com) is an interesting anti-malware and anti-virus software that can do it's job without a giant library of what those viruses and malwares are. ([video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlucytGx_Rw))  An AI could use a lot of heuristics in it’s detections of intrusive software behavior that a normal malware/virus protection wouldn’t notice. Like if certain files are being modified by different software other than is enacted from a user’s actions from a keyboard or mouse for instance.In general I believe that an AI network security agent would be a powerful ally for large computer networks. Hackers and malware is becoming much better. Also with the advent of more hardware level hacks such as putting in various chips into circuit boards like was talked about in the Edward Snowden movie and social engineering, an AI would be able to notice changes in network behavior and user behavior. Google is already doing some neat things where if I log into my accounts from different devices it notifies me to make sure everything is ok. AI could extend that type of over watch behavior.**IoT (Internet of Things)**We have started to see more things happening in the connectivity of our devices in homes and offices. Things like Nest, [Amazon’s Echo]( https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa/dp/B00X4WHP5E), Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant, etc.These devices use Natural Language Processing BUT have limitations in what they are capable of achieving. Some words work while others will not. The varied command recognition will increase over time. It does seem likely that soon they will start employing their AI cloud systems to start connecting more and more wifi devices as more wifi devices become available using AI. However with narrow AI, you will always have limitations of what it is capable of doing as the scope is determined by what they have programmed it to understand and do. It will be a while before you can have full on conversations that do not directly connect with utility type actions such as turning off things, changing the temperature of water, locking down your home, checking your bank account, etc. as that requires an AGI to actually comprehend and respond anywhere near reasonably.**Security** (BONUS)There has been a case that I've seen that uses AI to track people's behaviors in parking garages/office buildings so that it can know if someone is there that shouldn't be. It will only get better and be able to alert people to things like people trying to break into cars, rig explosives, commit crimes, etc. and will be able to use facial recognition to track them and such. It may even be able to have a predictive behavior component so that it could prevent crimes before they happen in those areas by either putting out a loud sound, turning off all the lights, calling security/police, etc. There are even some robots now that are designed as partial security forces so that may be integrated into such a system for security guard type capabilities.#I don't know too much about these things, but for netsec AI/ML can be useful by e.g. detecting anomalies in normal usage patterns or just generally classifying processes as malicious or not. And on the other side, attackers can also use AI to try to find exploits or try to avoid detection by e.g. trying to model normal user behavior or adapting based on successes and failures. I've heard people talk about AI being the future of cybersecurity on both sides of the issue, and fearing a kind of arms race between attackers and defenders. The Internet of Things will produce a ton of data that needs to be automatically analyzed (or ""mined"") in order to do something useful with it. When something interesting or out of the ordinary is detected, a device could contact some human, but perhaps in some cases we would want it to adapt its own behavior automatically. There is also a lot of research in knowledge-based systems on how to represent knowledge in a way that can be reasoned about, which can be important if the devices want to communicate with each other.#Glad you’re enjoying the post and hopefully you will enjoy the comments that CyberByte, others, and I will be giving in the thread.You’ve referenced: 1. http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v17/n3/full/nn.3655.html2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memoryThe general magic number theory is a basic theory on the working memory. You’ve referenced a more nuanced of working memory theory that talks about the working memory changing how many concepts it can keep in memory depending on domain and other various factors. They are both theories that are useful to reference. One is just simpler to reference and talk about as a generality. Fun fact, because of this kind of working memory theory, we tend to put dashes in long series of numbers such as phone numbers and social security numbers so that we can remember them easier. Otherwise it would just be on long series of numbers. Examples* Phone: 5-555-555-5555 OR 5.555.555.5555* Social Security: 555-55-5555#this 7 data points theory isnt really that relevant with regards to memory sports. A bit like the we only use 10% of our brain story.#Honestly, it's probably just Google search. Yeah, I know: boring. But many people don't realize it's AI, and I use it *all the time* and it works pretty good. And I should probably give a shout-out to my spam filter that I don't even use consciously, but it's pretty amazing at keeping out spam. I also use Translate a lot, because I live in a country where I don't speak the language, but I'm spoiled and just get frustrated when the translation isn't good enough for me to understand what's going on (which is often). Perhaps a little less boring: I think the [quick draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) game is pretty cool. And so is [lyrebird.ai](https://lyrebird.ai/) (which can produce speech in anyone's voice) and [style transfer](http://genekogan.com/works/style-transfer/). And I'm really looking forward to self-driving cars. #Data organization. This is a massive pain for humans as there are too many data points to look at all at once. There is a lovely method called Weighted Sum Model that can be utilized for this but other models are used for sorting things like Videos on Netflix as well as making video suggestions on YouTube.Although spam protection is boring, I think that is one of the most useful things AI has been able to be used for so far.#> How do AI startups realistically compete with the big players like Google or Facebook who have a lot more AI researchers and data?Figure out a method that hasn't been done before OR use current methods for an application that hasn't been done before. Basically the same rules of all startups in how to provide value that beats out the big guys. The big companies move slow, generally aren't as smart as people would hope them to be, etc. Small guys have to be brutally powerful and agile and generally are. They can use unconventional methods that a big company would disallow from the management level. Big companies HATE using unproven methods. A startup can whoop a big company in many ways.ALSO Deepmind for instance was acquired by Google but didn't start out massive.> Everyone says data = money now, but is there a realistic market for random data a company might be collecting?Data transformation can be used for many many things. Humans work all day to sort out the world they live in and do stuff with that data. With a system that can use more data and connect much further dots together, you can do some very neat things. One of my favorite uses is sentiment analysis used on twitter with the scope of what web hosting companies are bad or good and why. A massive pool of data to gather very good facts from.> Do you think there is an AI bubble? A .AI domain or company name is starting to sound like a .com.Most tech goes through specific cycles. I don't think AI is in a bubble right now though. We are just getting started. Hell, even websites aren't even anywhere near their end of what can happen. If you look at all the classifications of websites, there isn't a lot. Then a new one rages onto the scene and disrupts everyone's idea of what reality is.Humans are in a great period of time. The amount of advancement done in the last 100 years is mind blowing and is only getting started.> Do you think it would be wise go back to school tomorrow for 5-7 years and get a PhD in ML/AI? Can one build a career in ML/AI without a graduate degree in those fields?Yes and no. It's more of a gamble on when you think AI will hit AGI levels or the AI plateau. I do think that getting a computer science degree with a minor focus of AI is a wonderful option though. That will allow you to do coding and leverage AI for those projects. Otherwise you are just building an AI component for someone elses cool projects. Although if you are going for an AI degree you probably are going to be pretty stellar at regular coding anyway. I do believe that the field will become saturated however AND the tech changes so fast that it is very difficult to keep up on all of it. The field is expanding in breadth as well so perhaps you'd be able to do well.It's all a gamble like any other field you go into for over half a decade.#By having an original idea and/or catering to audiences that are too small/niche for the big players. Everything at Google/Facebook has to be ""big"", but as a small, agile startup you can be much more surgical. Also, Google/Facebook are not typically going to develop specialized solutions or consult for small/medium companies and clients. Edit: Sorry, my response was to your original post, which only had the first question IIRC. > Everyone says data = money now, but is there a realistic market for random data a company might be collecting?Well, not *random* data. It needs to be useful for some task. > Do you think there is an AI bubble? A .AI domain or company name is starting to sound like a .com.I'm not really sure, and I think here it's important to distinguish between commercial AI and AI/AGI research. I don't think this is like previous AI bubbles, because I think AI isn't just a promise now: it's really very profitable and can do lots of useful real-world tasks. Even if all fundamental research stops tomorrow, I think there will be companies that can benefit from current technologies for quite some time. But from a research perspective, I think we may be in a bit of a bubble, although I'm not sure. There is huge hype around deep learning now, and to be honest it keeps surprising me, but I also think there's a very good chance it's *not* the route to AGI. And if that turns out to be true, it may harm A(G)I research quite a bit, because it has drawn in so much talent/researchers and funding. In that sense, there may be a new AGI research winter, because I doubt that everybody will just switch to researching and funding the next most promising approach to AGI after such disillusionment. > Do you think it would be wise go back to school tomorrow for 5-7 years and get a PhD in ML/AI? Can one build a career in ML/AI without a graduate degree in those fields?I'll try to answer the second question first: it depends on what you want to do. If you want to be an AI professor, you need a PhD. If you want to apply to Google Research (or equivalent companies), you will probably need a PhD too (although they say you don't). Basically, to do really high-end research (and development) where you significantly push the state of the art, I think you will need a graduate degree (in Europe a masters degree may be sufficient). However, if you just want to build applications that are powered by AI, there are a ton of frameworks and tools for that, and you really don't need a PhD. I'm sure there are companies who would hire people without one, although I suppose they'd want to see some other relevant expertise (e.g. software engineering). Whether you should go back to school for 5-7 years also depend on what you want of course, but to be honest it sounds painful. On the other hand, I guess I did something similar: I worked for 3 years before going ""back to school"" for my PhD (although it's really nothing like being in school IMO, because I just do research and occasionally teach). BTW, if you do this, you better make sure you're researching something popular, like deep learning. But I don't know if it's a good idea for you. How settled are you in your current career, and in your family life? It will be tough if you have to support a spouse and children, and the opportunity cost will be staggering if you have to quit a decent career (like e.g. software engineer) in order to pursue a PhD. But of course, if you're super interested in AI and money/stability is a secondary concern, then you should go for it (I did). #Not OP, but I'm also an AI researcher. I would say it has a lot more to do with application and representation than sheer researcher and data quantities. The thing about AI is that the general concepts are commonly known (or at least easy enough to access) and the trick is tweaking that to any given problem. The vast number of possible applications means there is more than enough to go around. And even when it comes to the same problems that the big names are tackling, the problem could be represented slightly differently which can give you a competitive advantage...though this is obviously less likely. #We target niches that they aren't going after.  For example, my company is the market leader for AI in patient experience.  Google is focused on the clinical side (curing cancer).#Their releases of Gym and Universe are great services to the AI community, they're doing interesting research that is often open sourced, and their stated goal of ""discovering and enacting the path to safe artificial general intelligence"" is laudable. I was originally pretty skeptical, because I don't think open source AGI is a great idea if you're concerned about safety, but it now appears that they don't necessarily think that either. I also think they could probably do more to legitimize the superintelligence control problem in the eyes of other AI researchers (and the public), but I think avoiding those terms and associations with e.g. Bostrom and Yudkowsky is a possibly very intelligent strategy for not losing credibility. I have a long post on OpenAI [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlProblem/comments/63i7hx/openai_makes_humanity_less_safe_ben_hoffman/dfw9uau/). #What CyberByte said.#I'm still not 100% sure what you mean by ""semantic approach"" or maybe ""semantic learning approach"". Ontologies tend to be used in knowledge-based systems to represent knowledge in a typically human-understandable way. They represent an important mechanism for encoding our domain knowledge into an AI system. Relatedly, it used to be the case that a large part of machine learning was to do feature engineering: we used our expertise to extract salient features from raw data before we tried to learn something from it with an AI system. One of the great things about deep learning is that it basically does this feature engineering for us. We can just input e.g. pixels and the deep network will do its own feature extraction. In fact, when you visualize what nodes in an image recognition network respond to, it looks a lot like various edge detectors, which humans might previously have used to preprocess an image before learning started. In higher layers, the ""features"" tend to become more ""high level"", going e.g. from lines/edges, to eyes, ears and noses, to almost entire faces in a facial recognition network, or from lines/edges, to wheels and windows, to whole cars in a car recognition network. And perhaps we could even say that as these networks also encode relationships between nodes in their connections, it is a bit like an ontology. For connections between the two, I guess we could go in two different directions. On one hand, we might want to [learn the ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_learning) using e.g. deep learning. For instance, in this paper ([PDF](https://dkm-static.fbk.eu/people/rospocher/files/pubs/2016ekaw.pdf)) they trained a recurrent neural network to extract Web Ontology Language (OWL) formulae from text. Another somewhat related concept is word embeddings, where words are associated with a vector of numbers that encode semantics that can very closely resemble ours (cf. this paper [PDF](http://opus.bath.ac.uk/55288/4/CaliskanEtAl_authors_full.pdf)). And while that paper did not use deep learning, it's certainly possible to use it for getting word embeddings, e.g. by using the activations in some hidden layer of the network to represent a word (cf. [here](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/)). On the other hand, we might want to use ontologies (or at least some form of domain knowledge) to aid deep learning in cases where it's not so good at coming up with features and their relations. I'm actually not aware of much recent research on this, but it seems related to [explanation-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanation-based_learning) which has also been adapted for neural networks ([PDF](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/44c4/7c8c86c70aabe8040dce89b8de042f868f19.pdf)). Getting knowledge into a neural network is also studied in [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning), and one way to do that is to change the initialization of your ""new"" NN (this is e.g. done with pretraining on millions of images before learning a more specific task). I'm just spitballing here, but I think you could teach a neural network to encode an ontology by making it predict e.g. how/whether two input concepts are related (to encode our symbolic knowledge/ontology into the subsymbolic network), and then use the middle layers of that network to (partially) initialize some other network that you're going to learn the task you really care about. #They are useful building blocks and have some cross over traits. Semantic learning is more about conceptualizations of concepts using Natural Language Processing I believe than straight up deep learning is going to do. Deep learning is more of a trend learning kind of thing like how the subconscious picks up on information and tries to make sense of massive amounts of data. The utilization portion is the interesting part and generally is limited in scope of ability and tasks.I believe that you could utilize them together to create some pretty interesting applications however.Deep learning in my oppinion, while powerful, is a bit clunky for what everyone is hoping AI to be capable of doing in the future.I believe that having a system capable of conceptualizing things and then connecting them AND being able to interact with a human through Natural Language Processing is very useful. I think that deep learning can aid in the conceptualization stage and perhaps connecting the concepts together in vague forms, but not in very precise ways, much like any other deep learning black box type setup.#Could you clarify a bit what you mean by ""semantic (learning) approach""? Perhaps with some examples / links?#A paper at a recent AI conference I attended used similar data to manage greenhouse lighting to be cost and energy energy efficient.Link: http://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/en/catalog/2350920251You don't really need AI for this. Basic stats and Machine Learning algorithms should be powerful enough.#That's a huge conversation. I'll toss in my few cents on it but I think others have answered well on this question.I think a big thing in utilization is a few things: Organization of similar data pieces, correlation between different types of data pieces and how they interact, etc. #This falls under [data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining) (which is a part of AI). Your question is really broad though, and I'm not sure what to say about it. One thing you could do is detect anomalies/irregularities in your data and let the system warn you about them. If one (or more) of your variables can be considered as a goal (or anti-goal), you could find out how other variables affect it. For instance, if you (somehow) had data about how well your plants grew on a given day, as well as weather, location and type data, you might find that plant type A does better if it's standing in location X (where you know there's shade) when it's sunny, and plant type B does better if it's standing in location Y (where there's a roof) when it rains. This may then help you better spread out your plants (you can probably tell I know nothing about gardening). Generally speaking, you can do a lot (check out that Wiki page), but it depends a bit on your exact data and goals. #You could look at Amazons DSSTNE which is their product recommendation system. Trained as well I believe. Side question, would you pay for a product that implements that on your website?#From a business perspective I don't really know, but you could start doing [content-based filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-based_filtering) pretty much immediately, if you put in the effort of annotating the products you sell with different categories/properties. Then when you gather more data, you can start doing [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) (or some combination). For more sophisticated methods (like creating an entire user model using e.g. deep learning) you probably need a lot more data.#1. If you have a ton of money to toss at R&D then definitely would be useful for optimizations of both the website design as well as what you sell now, how much you sell things for, product research for what you should be selling and aren't, etc.2. If you are a newbie and there is a current solution you can buy/rent. R&D is expensive. You must first survive before you thrive. Otherwise you sink yourself.#I don't know if this is very probable, but if Google allows you to use their Earth data (I'm not sure what their stance is) and you can find some weather service to interact with in real time, I think it would be possible (at least in theory) to use some kind of [procedural generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation) to build a 3D game map from Google's limited data (e.g. they don't know anything about the insides of the houses, or what a particular set of trees in the jungle looks like), and add weather effects based on the weather. I imagine it's difficult on both the software engineering and AI/ProcGen end. #This is by far one of my favorite questions I was looking forward to answering.> What's the possibility of the integration Google earth and other world news/weather app information to create a game based on a map extremely like the world we live in?I've thought about this often. Especially with the recent Google Earth upgrade. I can look at my house from above at any angle and still see a fairly reasonable 3D graphic representation.It seems with the proper coding of AI you could have various AI agents take the current data and clean it up, tag what everything is, remap things as you dictate, and convert it all into something a current game engine could utilize. That is just one route. You could have the Game Engine have the AI agents and that would load the Google Earth, preprocess it, or if you get really good, have it all done on the fly.Definitely possible. I think that with Google cars there will be more data given as well. Also as we get better at taking images and turning them into 3D, that will also improve the quality and speed of such developments.Very excited to see it happen. It will be wonderful for people that want to travel but can't or old or disabled people that can't drive anymore or ever have been. It will allow for excellent driver's ed classes (because I refuse to accept that everyone will just use auto driving vehicles full stop without human overwatch).#If you train an AI system in one scenario, it's probably just going to learn to deal with that one scenario and perform very poorly when you change it. So if you always train with a red door, and then test the system with a blue door, chances are it's not going to go well. However, if you train it on red, green, yellow, brown, and black doors, and the actions are basically all the same, the system might learn that color doesn't matter and might do just fine on a blue door (even if it has never seen it). If the action is different for e.g. each door knob, and you train on 9 door knobs, then I think for most RL systems it would still be a bit of a crapshoot if it will be able to deal with a different 10th model. It will probably depend if the required action is ""in between"" the actions that correspond to the known door knobs that look the most similar. Generally speaking, it is incredibly difficult to get your (narrow) AI system to perform well in truly new situations. #Currently this is not possible BUT with some tweaks to current designs I've seen I believe it is possible, but when it comes to using NN's to do it, that is not so much available anymore. It comes down to creating prototypes of objects and scenarios in order to allow something to transfer or correlate such things. Jordan Peterson did an excellent video about this concept and used Autism as a premise. If very autistic child is in a home and someone moves a chair, the child sees the environment as a completely new environment vs a variation of the current environment. [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wNEy_Zffpc)#This also may be of interest to you. They trained an AI to pick up random stuff using a virtual training ground and transferred that knowledge to a real world scenario: https://futurism.com/an-ai-robot-learned-how-to-pick-up-objects-after-training-only-in-the-virtual-world/#In order to transfer anything you must first package it. Prototype Theory talks about how people put together concepts into little packages and then have variant factors that can be manipulated for the variants. Something similar would be necessary to dump ""knowledge"" chunks or processes from one scenario to another. Otherwise it's not very possible. That's the allure of AGI in that it will be able to cross domains and carry lessons from one domain to another.#I'm not really sure what you mean. It may help if you said what you're trying to do exactly. Since you're talking about weight configurations, I assume it's about training. Why not just store your entire data set, add new data points to it, and then retrain your NN on everything (or sample uniformly if the set is too big)? That way your weights will always be equally affected by your entire data set (both from the very recent and very far past). With recurrent neural networks, you can also take the (recent) past into account in your ""reasoning"" which affects the network's activations. In theory this should take into account data from as long ago as was optimal during training. However, it's very tricky to deal with multiple time scales, and it's often going to be biased towards being more influenced by the recent past. I think [Long Short-Term Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) can help with this.#You are very welcome. Thank you for the kind words. I have a question for you now. What are some things about AI in the video game industry that you think people should know about in terms of what is possible and what the current goals are of where they want to be possible?#Up to ASI with emotions and motivations merged with human minds in a biological-mechanical connection or form.#> What are your thoughts on intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning, and how does this differ from typical reinforcement learning?In typical reinforcement learning you have an agent that tries to optimize the expected value of some extrinsic reward function. Intrinsic motivation usually takes the form of an additional reward function that helps bias the agent towards certain states/behaviors. I think the most common kind is a curiosity drive that helps explore the state space more efficiently which is very important. Also, extrinsic motivation is usually fairly specific to a particular task, while intrinsic motivation tends to lead to more general acquisition of skills and knowledge, so it's especially relevant for AGI. > How big of a deal is Googles new TPU? Is it being overhyped or is it that good?Disclaimer: I'm not really an expert on deep learning or computer hardware. It sounds like a pretty big deal for the deep learning world. Deep neural networks actually have a ton of parameters, and choosing the right ones can be tricky. Better hardware for training allows you to experiment more in the same amount of time, with bigger networks and (probably) bigger data sets. Better hardware is largely what has enabled deep learning to become so successful to start with: most ideas underlying it are multiple decades old, and I think new developments were greatly aided by the faster feedback loop and larger problems that this hardware has enabled. > What's your favorite programming language?C# because I'm used to it, but I would recommend Python and/or C++ to people who are looking to learn a programming language for AI.> What's the best way for an undergrad student to get involved with artificial intelligence? It seems really hard to get involved in open source projects because a lot of the projects are really complex! (Case in point: TensorFlow)Check out /r/artificial's new wiki page on [Getting Started with AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/wiki/getting-started). First of all, I would recommend that you take classes related to AI (if your university doesn't offer AI, look at relevant computer science and math classes, and perhaps cognitive science and philosophy). Try to work with a professor who is interested in AI to do a project and maybe write a paper for a small (local) conference or something. I think the way to get into any field is probably to get contacts in that field. To that end it helps going to conferences and meetups, get into contact with people in the field (e.g. read AI papers and contact the authors with good(!) questions) and see if your university has any tech/hacker/CS/AI groups that you can join. To get started with open source projects like Tensorflow, I would recommend that you just try to do your own (simple) projects with the framework at first to get a feel for it. Join the dev mailing list. Look at their code occasionally, specifically the parts that ""touch"" your code. It will be difficult to make major contributions at first, but you can start small by fixing small bugs that nobody else has time for (look in their bug tracker). As you get more and more familiar with the code base, it will become easier to contribute. At some point you can start adding new features. There's usually a list of planned/requested features somewhere (if you want to add generalized features from your own project, it's a good idea to propose them here first, so that they can be discussed/approved).> Does your company offer internships?I'm currently a PhD student, but companies where I've worked in the past have all offered internships. #> How big of a deal is Googles new TPU? Is it being overhyped or is it that good?I believe that TPU is a processor like GPU, PPU, or the various other processing units designed for a very specific set of processes. It is a good thing that it now exists as it will aid in things BUT I don't believe it is like a holy grail or anything like that. There will be more companies coming out with TPUs and similar specialized AI chips in the future for sure. It is basically a massive shortcut to trying to bruteforce the current hardware into doing what you want it to do.> What's the best way for an undergrad student to get involved with artificial intelligence? It seems really hard to get involved in open source projects because a lot of the projects are really complex! (Case in point: TensorFlow)I'd suggest doing what anyone does when they are just starting out. Tinker around with your skills to sharpen them. Challenge yourself with small projects at the start and then add features or build more complex projects. There are a lot of excellent simplistic ML type projects you can do that are powerful and teaching experiences. My favorite being the sentiment analysis of web hosts from twitter posts. I'd really like to see an AI project that uses reddit content data or the biggest interesting one would be Facebook. You could map entire useful sets of things like:Connected sub-reddits, the general personality behaviors in those sub-reddits (there is a tool online that analyses small bits of text to give you personality information), etc.You could on Facebook analyze entire personalities, different vocabulary patterns and not even just words but what are called ""fixed expressions"" and analyze the personalities and how that affects the interaction of their friends or just random people, etc.> Does your company offer internships? I don't run an AI company, I'm an entrepreneur who is passionate about AI enough to research it and design AI systems for my business purposes. At some point when I get one of these companies off the ground I will want someone with the ability to do that kind of coding and has that background to help me. Specifically for the purpose of why I even got into AI. I was designing an advanced startup resource and methodology database and got tired of trying to update it when methods needed updated or companies/products/services would change or go belly up. #I'll hear you out and spitball about AI in PMs, discord, or skype.I myself wouldn't start an AI centered startup unless I had some secret sauce I could milk for at least 1 year before everyone else was able to replicate it in any reasonable level. Basically the same business strategy you'd hope for with anything at a maximum level of comfort. I think that a small AI startup is definitely possible as I have many small AI company projects in mind but you'd actually have to have the ability to code it and then you yourself turn that into a business or work with someone that can help you form that into a business. We can talk more about this if you want in voice chat on discord or skype. PM me if you want. If I don't get back to you in a day or two, hit me up again because I'll be getting lost in these inbox messages for a while.#Wikipedia has a good intro. Then look into videos online or the giant book written about it called women fire and dangerous things.#> Are there ""business models"" (involving AI) that have a great cost to society, that we should not mention in writing, since an AI could be reading and learning?Mostly no, but as with anything informational, there are things an individual can achieve that would take an enormous amount of luck and effort to get to in terms of solutions and methods. But basically no, because information can be operated on just like math does with numbers. It's a massive conversation to uncover all of the details that make clear what I just said unless you already have those data pieces in your own mind. :/> If so: How the holy f**k do we protect against them, especially if we really shouldn't verbalize them?If and only if there is that scenario that exists in the first place, you'd have to build the solution off the reach of the internet such as in person or through the physical mail.In the end however, you cannot put the genie back into the bottle. When it is capable of overtaking it will not be able to go backwards. Even EMPs cannot protect against this outcome. Only a physical parasite with an electronic detriment with a pure goal of destroying said AI threat could be effective. Shielding against EMPs is already been talked about by many people.Curious... what's your follow up question? I love fringe conversations that may or may not ever come to fruition to witness.#> How would we know if AIs were already active ""in the wild"" online, what would be signs of this? and are we monitoring for such signs?You'd see activity that a human or set of humans could not achieve at such speeds or complexity. Basically anomolous behavior. Some have said we should monitor for such things and I imagine some people have tried or do try and perhaps even maybe some more shadowy portions of the government of some country is doing just that. Considering the things Edward Snowden uncovered for the world to witness, it is possible that governments do almost anything wacked out we assume they are capable of doing.> What would be the most likely outcome if different AIs with different ethical strictures started manipulating the same objects or individuals online? (They would presumably learn to recognize each other's presence, but what would be the likely outcome of this learning&interaction process?)The same outcome as if two intelligence agencies were to do such actions. They would either accelerate their plans, try to negate the other's actions, or form an alliance.> What's the prognosis of all this for humans and democracy and freedom and stuff?It depends on the goals, actions, and outcomes of such advanced AIs. It definitely is an arms race of types in terms of pace, specific use, and format classification. Personally I believe that you will see a variety of scenarios crop up as time goes on but as with most of human history we will fight back against the dangerous bits until we perish in doing so or survive to see the next battles and wars.Until humans are fully capable of being manipulated by AIs, humans will continue to fight for democratic and freedom based goals. Sidenote, the USA is a democratic republic. Mainly because of the concept called [Argumentum Ad Populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) logical fallacy that parents use the cliche of ""If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?"" uses to prove such a point of logical failing.#> If someone was prescient, what additions or modifications would they suggest to the U.S. Bill of Rights, to address the potential influence of AIs?* prescient - having or showing knowledge of events before they take place.I think it would include that any political governing authority must be as a human and be human at the time of governing. Something more fancy and legally binding but with the gist being they must be human and not an ai with human parts in terms of the computations done relating to the governing actions such as finalizing bills, etc. It's a bit complicated as there are a ton of variations that allow loop holes so you'd have to close all of them.AI must only be a tool, not the wielder of control over humans. I gave a similar overview in the question relating to the possible situation of doctors being replaced by AI/robots. [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/6fjpn1/ama_im_an_entrepreneur_and_ai_researcher/dik0h64/?context=10000)> are you prescient? what do you think we will need?While I do not like to claim to be, I am more often than I'd like. Seeing the outcome before it happens ruins my ability to have false hope and therefore temporal joy in most subject scopes. Relationships, economy, government action, people's actions, etc. :/For instance, me and roughly 10 others in highschool designed very advanced things because we foresaw the pathway that the USA and world was taking in political, social, and economic terms. Those predictions continue to come true. Similar with various high tech inventions such as magnetic scanners being used in a specific way paired with ""training"" material to be able to read people's minds in a visual sense such as seeing their dreams. I suggest that while powerful and useful in some scenarios, it destroys your want to live.Basically, information can be drawn from axioms to logical conclusions in quite an extensive way. This is also one factor that makes AGI massively dangerous if not properly solved (control problem/s).In the end, in a more philosophical tone, it's best to just hope for the best and plan for the worst.You see, humans attempt to predict the nature of others based on what is realistic/logical but most people operate on emotions vs facts so they end up operating using their ideals. Reality vs ideals give you very different prediction outcomes. So to effectively predict the outcome of what people will do, you structure logical processes but instead of inserting what is a logical thing for people to do, you insert what people tend to do.I have a gnarly feeling this comment is going to get me some unwanted heat, but I like being genuine and it is an interesting set of topics to discuss.#> What I find mindboggling about the top-level questions asked so far, in the 100+ comments, is that not a single one from anyone else addresses potential effects on society and their possibly being detrimental. Is this absence just reflecting the population of r/startups, the moderators, or is there some other explanation?AI concerns reach far and wide and such concerns did not fall under the scope of the starting or running of businesses using AI technology.The effects however of AI on the economy will at first be very painful but as it is accelerated in terms of how quick the changes thus effects thus response, it isn't as big a problem as other things that erode standard economic theories and practices.The combine and farm tractors in general were some of the first things that marked the beginning of the end for standard capitalistic economic stability. That slow move of automating everything possible removed job after job after job. This took a long time to get to the painfulness we are experiencing now.With AI accelerating it, it puts basic income acceptance into overdrive in terms of necessity vs ideal. > (or, if this here AMA is intrinsically more constrained and non-impact-oriented, where would such questions be better addressed?)These types of economic impact theory in terms of AI being a main driving component should be done in /r/artificial or a sub-reddit that deals with economic theory conversations which one of them happens to be the basic income sub-reddit.The lack of this conversation being had in this thread is definitely not the fault of the moderation team and just doesn't fall within the scope of /r/startups intentions as a whole.#You are going to want to watch this new video: [The Rise of the Machines - Why Automation is Different this Time](https://youtu.be/WSKi8HfcxEk)#> As far as programming AI, what language do you believe will be the future for it?This is talked about a lot over in /r/artificial at various times. I personally believe that the more capable the programming language is at more actions is the best to operate with so you'd have things like C languages because they can do way more with a computer's hardware controls and such. Python and I think even Javascript are becoming powerful enough to somewhat rival that but not completely. I believe that at the end you will see C being the main driver while python and Javascript builds are for more ease of use and connection with offline and online environments. Basically C languages would be when python and Javascript can't do the job. That's my rough take on it. Check out the threads over in /r/artificial that talk about what programming languages to use.> Also, do you believe AI will ever replace programmers?Yes, when people figure out how to:* effectively communicate to the AI their intentions* when AI is designed that is sufficiently capable of creative behavior... basically non-sentient AGI is the minimum level of when the full take over of all engineering and science is done through AI. A sad day that will be. There still will be people doing it manually though as people just as an AGI can create things that other creative agents aka people do not/cannot due to massive variations in datasets and goals and personality driving traits.#Sure. We can chat on skype or discord if you'd like.#That would fall under AGI/ASI and is part of the control problem when looking at a sentient version of an AGI/ASI vs a non-sentient one that just gives you a paperclip optimization problem.#*looks at hands and body* Yes. I think I am at least. Why do you ask?#Well it isn't learning but it definitely is a product of machine learning.An AI is a product that using ML to do the tasks you ask it to do.

It is important to figure out where your project is.There are some AI services that do comply with HIPPA type protocols and they generally will market their service with such a talking point. I think it was some of IBM's Watson type services that allow for it. I saw it in a few services that I had been researching to put into the Mainstream Creations, Products, and Services listing.#Honestly, the best recognition engines are going to be hosted. Some will allow for hippa, usually via private cloud. (Amazon being the industry standard, although Google has an option I haven't evaluated.)Trust me, you don't want to host or run these engines yourself  it's not feasible.#Sure, let's see what we can do. I'm going to need a bit more context before I can help you with that though. Are you looking to learn about what you can do with it, finding the people to do the ai portion for you, how to find AI related startups you can use your business skills in, etc.?#> AzureDon't know much about it but I took a [quick overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/index#pivot=services&panel=all) and believe that you can definitely use some of their tools but I think as with most solutions you will have pros and cons in terms of how configurable it is and how much of it you have to setup on your own and how much they allow you to get at the tool vs it being a big black box.As with the other solutions, it isn't magic, you have to know what building blocks you are using and how much it is going to cost you as well as how dependent you will be on their tools if they decide to change direction, give up, raise the cost through the roof, etc. I believe that with Google's stuff you have more ""open source"" type mentality compared to Microsoft who has always tried to milk you for every dime you have and then the dimes your granny may have hidden in the couch cushions.I think for testing and getting things off the ground it is likely ok, but in the end, it is best to make sure you have a solution you can work with long term vs that will disappear on you. I've always been a fan of use the other stuff while creating your own version and then replacing all the components with your own or what you can buy and keep for the long term. All basically business strategy and protecting your interests long term.#Azure has some great capabilities, and is easy to use. When I was evaluating it, I found it difficult to figure out how to modify settings for my use case. I think it's fine to use individual AI apis from azure, but I generally found them to only suit limited cases. I guess that's a hard question to answer. Like with any tool, choose the one that works best for you. #> Hello, I'm thinking about a product that bridges the gap between AI assistant and virtual assistants. Do you think this would be a useful product? By virtual assistant do you mean the people a startup hires to do things for them like send out emails or do various campaigns and they are a contract worker?> How would I go about finding a cofounder with AI background? My background is user acquisition (getting customers for apps and software).Definitely easier now than it ever has been before. I'd hit up colleges that teach computer science or ai, forums that are heavily populated by ai researchers looking to sink their teeth into something and need a business person to help them form their talent into a business. That's what I got for you so far.###Intelligence explosionThe intelligence explosion is a possible outcome of humanity building artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI would be capable of recursive self-improvement leading to rapid emergence of ASI (artificial superintelligence), the limits of which are unknown. An intelligence explosion would be associated with a technological singularity.The notion of an ""intelligence explosion"" was first described by Good (1965), who speculated on the effects of superhuman machines, should they ever be invented:Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/startups/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove#I've been thinking about this deeply the past 2 days. First off, thanks for the AMA and response. I can understand why it can become troubling for most to literally create a super powered sentient being. The main issue I think is can you control it? When does it become uncontrollable and is that what we are ultimately seeking? I believe if the private sector or academia does achieve this, it will at once be something that needs to be contained or confiscated by government entities.In the proper format though, the possibilities of what can be streamlined is immense. You mention war but what do you think would be the first application of sentient AI?#Awesome thanks for responding! I am playing around with image recognition at the moment and it's great fun watching the ML behind it pick up more and more matches. #[deleted]#Thanks for the detailed answer!###Ontology learningOntology learning (ontology extraction, ontology generation, or ontology acquisition) is the automatic or semi-automatic creation of ontologies, including extracting the corresponding domain's terms and the relationships between those concepts from a corpus of natural language text, and encoding them with an ontology language for easy retrieval. As building ontologies manually is extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming, there is great motivation to automate the process.Typically, the process starts by extracting terms and concepts or noun phrases from plain text using linguistic processors such as part-of-speech tagging and phrase chunking. Then statistical or symbolic  techniques are used to extract relation signatures, often based on pattern-based or definition-based hypernym extraction techniques.***##Explanation-based learningExplanation-based learning (EBL) is a form of machine learning that exploits a very strong, or even perfect, domain theory in order to make generalizations or form concepts from training examples.***##Transfer learningTransfer learning or inductive transfer is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks. This area of research bears some relation to the long history of psychological literature on transfer of learning, although formal ties between the two fields are limited.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/startups/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove#Good response.

It is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science. The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use. Aside from the raw analysis step, it involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/startups/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove#[deleted]#Thanks for that rec, I'm looking over the documentation now.

Collaborative filtering has two senses, a narrow one and a more general one.In the newer, narrower sense, collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/startups/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove###Procedural generationIn computing, procedural generation is a method of creating data algorithmically as opposed to manually.

Like most RNNs, a LSTM network is universal in the sense that given enough network units it can compute anything a conventional computer can compute, provided it has the proper weight matrix, which may be viewed as its program. Unlike traditional RNNs, an LSTM network is well-suited to learn from experience to classify, process and predict time series when there are time lags of unknown size and bound between important events. Relative insensitivity to gap length gives an advantage to LSTM over alternative RNNs and hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/startups/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove#generally I'm doing time series predictions and trying to predict 1 set out whatever that set is).

Everyone thinks that playing a game against an AI that learns would be fun and different, but what really happens is that it ups the level of difficulty to a point that a player no longer enjoys the experience.For example: take a Jackal AI sniper in Halo. The first time you play through the level, it's not going to immediately know where you are, so you can easily kill it. However, over time, it's going to learn how you play and suddenly it's going to jump very high in difficulty with no warning. Suddenly it knows every move that you're going to make in that level, and it no longer is fair for the player.Another aspect that I like to explain is when people criticize ""dumb"" bots in games like Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Writing AI's like that is a delicate balance. On the one hand: if you make them too stupid they provide no challenge at all. On the other hand: they have perfect information. What do I mean by perfect information? The AI can see everything that is going on in the backend of the game calculations, so if we really programmed an AI to the best of our abilities, it would never miss, it would always know where you are, and it would beat you 100% of the time.So we have to be selective about what information we tell it to ignore, we have to slow down reation times, we have to add pauses before they take actions, we have to program random miss cases so that it looks like they're vaguely human.When it comes down to it, the hardest part of programming AI in video games is making them fun to play against. As it turns out, no one like playing against a perfect machine.I hope that provided a little bit of insight, I tried not to get too technical about it as I could go on about this for days (and have been known to, in the past.)

I believe it is possible but I would have no way of proving it 100% without actually testing it and we both have a good idea of how dangerous that attempt could be if it fails to work AND escapes containment procedures.Please look into what is called The Control Problem. There is the sentient version and the non-sentient version. The sentient version is basically like asking how would you stop a god in human form but is capable of replicating itself and transferring itself over the internet and has the ability to intrude and infect all computers connected to the internet and off the internet (it would ship itself to off internet systems). The non-sentient version has an example called the paper clip optimizer problem.> When does it become uncontrollable and is that what we are ultimately seeking?It becomes uncontrollable when it doesn't have boundaries that it cannot go past in order to achieve it's goals that it is given. (paperclip optimizer problem) A sentient AGI becomes uncontrollable when it is given it's own motivations and emotions. Empathy tends to reign in people's behavior quite a bit but motivations and emotions both still cause humans to do screwed up things. Basically the same problems with uncontrollable behavior you'd have with any human. > I believe if the private sector or academia does achieve this, it will at once be something that needs to be contained or confiscated by government entities.I agree that the government will try to take it and keep it to itself. However I don't think it will be possible to do such things as the people that create such advanced things are also a bit paranoid and would just ship a copy to all corners of the earth, bury many many copies that others can locate, use Wikileaks type system to dump the code to, spread the code all over the internet to repositories such as github, etc. If Snowden could get files out of that super secure base, strong AI will get into the wild and out of the governments hands. Mainly because if they don't, the government takes it and kills them and anyone that might know of their work. > In the proper format though, the possibilities of what can be streamlined is immense. > You mention war but what do you think would be the first application of sentient AI?I believe that there are five main purposes other than war in which it would be used first. In order:1. **Medical field** - Solving medical problems such as cures, stop gap solutions for things without cure ability, etc. and helping doctors figure out what is wrong with patients and how to get them better.2. **Engineering** - I believe that AI will in essence take over all engineering fields as the dominant tool/resource for completing engineering projects. Mechanical, electrical, bio, chemical, etc.3. **Fact checking** - There are so many places trying to fact check politicians, people's scientific theories, etc. Fact checking with an AI would be amazingly useful. It could map entire complex arguments in flow chart form for people to see what is broke and what isn't and such.  This would be amazingly useful to weed out garbage in proposed bills and such. It could instantly fact check anyone's testimony to see if they were lying. It would make presidential election debates amazingly fun to watch as they get beat down by a buzzer every time they lie and the lie is instantly available to be shown why what they said is a lie.4. **Entertainment industry** - No more need for actors, singers, music writers, book authors, TV show or movie writers, etc. Story, environment, characters, voices/audio, etc. will all be synthetically generated to perfect accuracy.5. **Philosophy** - There is so much data in philosophy that it is very difficult to break it down to find flaws and what is missing and such. To solve these things would advance humanity in a hurry. Like turning babies into mature adults in 10 years kind of fast.Everything else is gravy and minutia for the most part. [Boom!-shacka-lacka.](https://youtu.be/BPXgZSWspTw?t=22s)#You're very welcome. #Getting data is the hard part.  We convinced clients one at a time to trust us.  We trained our initial models with public patient experience data (Yelp).#Oh right, cool my friend! Is it software you have built and sell (like a shopify plugin) or is it actually a service where you implement a trained model into somebodies website, then it starts hashing out recommendations? If the second one, how the hell do you find potential customers and make sales!?#> Do you have the graphical skill to implement this on a smaller scale?What do you mean by that?#Yeah, the answer is pretty much ""no"". There may be ways to engineer the system or change the representation that will allow it to generalize from its training in one consistent situation to other different situations, but this is going to be very difficult. It's better to train on a wide variety of situations.#Don't know.#You should be able to train your RNN on one time series (2000-2010) or multiple time series, and use it to make predictions about another one (2015-2025) as long as they are similar enough. It sounds like you're doing that. So what is the problem?#> For example: take a Jackal AI sniper in Halo. Yea... The AI in halo was amazing. I've got a creepy story about Halo one and AI if you want to hear it.That was a great overview btw. I bought a massive game development book back in 2003 time period and holy jebus were game developers advanced even back then. It made playing video games a lot more interesting to see how they operated from behind the curtain.#Just to be clear, that's just my take on it.#I was talking about Prototype Theory before I knew someone had a name for it. There are many concepts that are talked about in various areas of studies by different people and given different names while other times they just go without being named. Humans are great at that. You would really like the Everything Is A Remix video as it talks about how calculus was invented roughly at the same time by two people. That situation happened with Darwin's theories and other people's creations that have changed humanity.I honestly thing Jordan Peterson has created a lot of his own works unknowingly matching other famous similar creations. It's nearly impossible not to when you get super far into abstractions and complex conceptual formulations.#Likely best you not keep your contact out in the public here. I'll contact you right now on skype if you want to remove the name from the public entry here.#Yes he is human. I'm not sure why you are asking this though.Not sure about that automated warning thing you are asking about. Link to examples?#You're welcome. #Ah ok. You yourself want to actually code AI stuff. In that case, head over to /r/artificial and check out the wiki that has some information on how to get started. Also, yes, you can learn how to program from online classes. Standford University also has lectures online about AI.My pathway into AI is much different than I'd suggest for anyone.#Could you elaborate on how in your mind this bridging of the AI assistant tool and real person virtual assistant would look or work in feature or function terms?#> The Control Problem.Thanks for the detailed answer. I'm happy to discover this term exists. I've been playing catch up so to speak. One thing that you mention is motivation. It comes down to what would be the motivation of who ultimately achieves sentient AI.Plus 1 for the the boom shacka-lacka#[deleted]#I'm not sure exactly how to word it. I'm guessing it would take at least some graphic based knowledge to create a prototype of an area. I don't really know. Its late and I may be just going crazy.#Hmmm this pretty much shits on the current idea I was developing LOL. Didn't realise what I was trying to do was that impossible. However I will take your word for it, you're the expert (literally). But not to worry, Imma change it but keep the main concept of picking up an item with a robot arm. Thanks!#I don't really have a good example ATM. I just know the Ann doesn't hold past data very well with new datasetstraditional ann's tend to put more weight towards the most recent data.  I was hoping their was a way to feed all past data into the next set of inputs.  Of course the inputs would grow with each input.  Similar to a Fibonacci sequence.#Well I'd sure like to!#Yes, I'm currently reading *Into the Woods: A Five-Act Journey Into Story* by John Yorke which is a dense work on the narrative structure common in all forms of stories. He discovered some of the same ideas that Jordan Peterson has on how we map new territory (venture into the woods) and how we integrate these new experiences into our map of the world, the domain of what is known which is expanded by successfully encountering the unknown (in the dark, mysterious woods of fairy tales). All the stories we tell ourselves are reflections of our experience and how we process new knowledge. #If you search r/IAMA for that phrase, you should get plenty of examples.#[deleted]#The motivation of a human is influenced by its creators aka parents but you can see how well children actually adhere to the teachings of what motivations to have compared to the child's eventual personal motivations in reality. I don't think Hitler was trained to hate Jews by his parents for instance. The Westboro Baptist kid noped right out of the family as well. You can see how an AI might just fakes it's way through training then do its own thing.#Awesome! Did you create your own dataset? How much do you charge (give a ballpark figure if you like my friend) 0 - 100, 100 - 500, 500 - 1000? 1000+?#I think you are asking if I am capable of detailing the methods in which to manipulate the graphical details of my overviewed plan/solution to your original question. The answer is basically yes. To implement it into code? Not as much. At some point I'll get deep into coding, but for now I'm more of a systems/process engineer in relation to AI process and structure.#Me and my buddy were playing the Halo 1 [Prisoner multiplayer map](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Prisoner).We were playing halo 1 multiplayer maps every single day through Christmas vacation for 8+ hours a day. We were both chasing each other near the top of the map. All of a sudden a rocket comes from the opposing side of the map that neither of us were located in. We were really good at this point so as soon as we hear a rocket we could turn and see where it was coming from as we jump out of the way usually. What we both saw was a player in active camouflage right before we both died from the rocket as I was very close to meleing my buddies player's character. It was just two of us playing. This was before internet connected xbox games. So there wasn't a hack, it wasn't either of us as the character.This was shortly after starting to read the video game book and reading a bit on the AI portions. We both concluded that someone had put in some kind of Easter Egg that triggered an AI to randomly attack players that have been playing an extensive amount of time in the multiplayer maps against each other.This was after we realized that the Jackals were learning from our player behavior after every time we would die in the campaign mode in multiplayer. We had to formulate a plan that contradicted our previous strategies so that we could actually beat that portion of the campaign mode.I have a feeling someone got bored and added a few AI Easter Eggs to halo 1's code.Anyhow, we turned off the Xbox for a while after that random AI popped out and killed us and disappeared back into nothingness. #Excellent response. Thank you for making it.#This is /r/startups.#Definitely can see the value in that alliance of man and software. People constantly try to improve their tools to reduce their workload or increase their effectiveness or capabilities. Many times with things like IFTTT or excel plugins. I really love the excel plugins. I think you are getting at a much powerful tool alliance though. It seems like you definitely could build some open ended AI software that allows variance in utility focus that would be useful for virtual assistants to enhance their abilities. Like hunting down better and more contacts for x scenario or the sorting of data or gathering doing research using sentiment analysis on various social platforms or even email responses between two dates, x length of responses, various domain filtering, subject matter, etc.I can see the massive value in both the creation of said tools to sell and the utilization of said tools for virtual assistants or even just the startup founders themselves."
ethtrader;6dzdq9;1496051021.0;/r/ethtrader/comments/6dzdq9/a_beginners_guide_to_erc_20_coins/;A Beginner's Guide to ERC 20 Coins;Hi everyone, it’s me u/poop_dragon. I made this comment about ERC20 coins last week in the daily thread and a lot of you suggested making a separate post. I wanted to add your suggestions and start a kind of education resource for beginners. Again, I’ve tried to stay objective, but there is some personal opinion because this is about trading, not just tech. I think it would be really great for people to add any coins or important information that they believe I have missed. This list is not meant to be definitive, and I am certainly not an expert. *Here it goes…*#**Golem*** **Ticker:** GNT* **Website:** https://golem.network/* **Subreddit:** r/GolemProject* **Current Marketcap:** $399,686,778* **Current Price:** $0.484544 (-2.57%)* **Brief:** *From the Company -* Golem is a global, open sourced, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can access. It's made up of the combined power of user's machines, from personal laptops to entire data centers. Anyone will be able to use Golem to compute (almost) any program you can think of, from rendering to research to running websites, in a completely decentralized & inexpensive way. The Golem Network is a decentralized sharing economy of computing power, where anyone can make money 'renting' out their computing power or developing & selling software. Their most current [whitepaper](https://golem.network/doc/Golemwhitepaper.pdf) projects their first release of the product, ~~Clay~~ Brass Golem, in Q2 2017. That’s now in case you didn’t know and [github reports that it is 68% complete and on track for a May 31st release.]( https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/milestone/11) * **Trader Hot Take:** The value of cloud computing can be debated, it is a growing market, but by how much? I have read predictions for [$390 Billion by 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/02/11/global-cloud-spending-predicted-to-reach-390b-by-2020/#6b8bcc9e1085) and some much, much bolder predictions on the Golem subreddit. With any luck Golem will be taking a slice of that pie, but the speculation is how much and how do they get it. Right now the ~~Clay~~ Brass release aims to tackle computer rendering through cloud sharing, which seems like all awful small part of the market compared with other services like data storage. Although everyone has tremendous things to say about the intuition and skill of the development team, I think the value of this coin depends on finding then capitalizing on the right applications of cloud computing. #**Augur**+ **Ticker:** REP – [short for Reputation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCms-snzHk4)+ **Website:** https://augur.net/+ **Subreddit:** r/Augur+ **Current Marketcap:** $238,190,700+ **Current Price:** $21.65 (-6.64%)+ **Brief:** [Augur is a fully open-source and decentralized prediction market platform.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yegyih591Jo) + **Trader Hot Take:** Augur reports that they should launch [late summer 2017.](http://blog.augur.net/faq-frequently-asked-questions/) followed quickly by a bug bounty. If it goes smoothly, expect things to happen. I believe that not only does this company stand to make profits off users, but also the data that comes from group behavior. Big data is an invaluable resource – companies salivate over this kind of stuff. Platform use is incentivized for the user base, so I hope for it to catch on and become successful. Not just that but I like CEO Jack Peterson’s [travel blog](http://travelmag.co.uk/2012/11/tangled-by-mandarin-on-a-love-ship-tour-of-taiwan/), gotta love a good blog. However, they have competition…# **Gnosis**+ **Ticker:** GNO+ **Website:** https://gnosis.pm/+ **Subreddit:** r/gnosisPM+ **Current Marketcap:** $234,769,559+ **Current Price:** $212.54 (-2.01%)+ **Brief:** Like Augur Gnosis looks to establish a [decentralized prediction market.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-94-JDLdiA) Notably, Gnosis is backed by Consensys, a venture production studio developing Ethereum dApps. Gnosis sees financial and betting applications as innovative and envisions a future where prediction markets can optimize an incredible range of processes. Also, with the potential to provide a platform for information sales. [Whitepaper for everything and more](https://gnosis.pm/resources/default/pdf/gnosis_whitepaper.pdf)+ **Trader Hot Take:** I could not find information about a potential launch date for Gnosis, that may hurt their cause if someone beats them to market. However, with the backing of big names, there is a lot of buzz. GNOs market cap is almost identical to Augur’s [despite only issuing 4% of their supply.]( https://blog.sia.tech/want-to-deflate-the-token-bubble-fix-the-market-cap-indicator-d50f7f1e1ec4) In the end though if they are competing, it will come down to who has the better development team. Investors should do their due diligence on both companies and then decide who to invest in. Maybe its both #**Iconomi**+ **Ticker:** ICN+ **Website:** https://www.iconomi.net/+ **Subreddit:** r/ICONOMI+ **Current Marketcap:** $94,977,900+ **Current Price:** $1.09 (-3.58%)+ **Brief:** The ICONOMI Digital Assets Management Platform is more than just a market place for digital assets. We provide the best experience and simplest method to enter the growing distributed economy. The ICONOMI service breaks down the barriers traditionally encountered by first-time investors. With a broad set of unique and intuitive tools for a person of any skill level, it enables users to invest and manage various digital assets or combined Digital Assets Array™ (DAA). The first DAA open for investment is index-based ICNX. This presents a first step towards establishing a network of DAA managers and users. [Financial Report and Whitepaper](https://medium.com/iconominet/iconomi-financial-report-q1-2017-a1b9dff59e2c) + **Trader Hot Take:** Important disclaimer. ICN is the ICO which was a direct investment in ICONOMI. It will not be a DAA, but the coin will be ‘burnt’ which means it will be re-purchased then removed from circulation. This is a way of profit sharing to paying back initial investors with higher coin prices. I have seen posts here criticizing this move because it puts too much faith in the company, they are under no legal obligation to burn these coins. Their later release of ICNX will be tied to a DAA with their digital portfolio. With the PRISM released this week, a lot of people started comparing ICONOMI to this. I think this idea holds potential, maybe it’s the start of mutual funds or ETFs for crypto. However, they need to prove why they are smarter investors than the average wallet hodler. #**Aragon**+ **Ticker:** ANT+ **Website:** https://aragon.one/+ **Subreddit:** r/aragonone – ghosts+ **Current Marketcap:** $59,712,685+ **Current Price:** $1.78 (-7.76%)+ **Brief:** The Aragon Network (AN) will be the first DAO whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction that makes it extremely easy and friendly for organizations, entrepreneurs and investors to operate. Aragon is everything you need to run your company on Ethereum. Cap table, governance, fundraising, payroll, accounting, bylaws. Aragon organizations will be able to be seamlessly upgraded and solve human disputes using a decentralized court system. [Whitepaper at github](https://github.com/aragon/whitepaper/blob/master/Aragon%20Whitepaper.pdf)+ **Trader Hot Take:** With the ANT sale happening just last week, I will not pretend like I understand anything about this project. But as we go deeper down a crypto rabbit hole, I can imagine a use for decentralized organizations and arbitration. How the value of this coin and company relates, determine for yourself. #**FirstBlood**+ **Ticker:** 1ST+ **Website:** https://firstblood.io/+ **Subreddit:** ???+ **Current Marketcap:** $52,005,201+ **Current Price:** $0.607833 (-8.39%)+ **Brief:** [A decentralized eSports reward platform that every gamer loves.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oFZNaI07wc&feature=youtu.be) Play matches using an on-platform token and claim rewards from the activity. [Whitepaper on github](https://github.com/Firstbloodio/white-paper/blob/master/FirstBlood_White_Paper_EN.pdf)+ **Trader Hot Take:** If you are a gamer, this has gotta make you excited. This could revolutionize competitive and even recreational play for just about any game. As an idea, I could see this working for PCs and I wonder if it could even make its way to consoles. Witnesses and Jury systems make the payment process a little complicated, but I really like the Global Ranking and Reputation features. Whether or when First Blood gets adopted determines the price of this coin in my opinion. #**Melon**+ **Ticker:** MLN+ **Website:** https://melonport.com/+ **Subreddit:** r/melonproject/+ **Current Marketcap:** $32,218,469+ **Current Price:** $53.75 (-11.40%)+ **Brief:** Founded in 2016, Melonport AG is building Melon, a blockchain-based asset management protocol. It enables participants to set up, manage and invest in digital asset management strategies in an open, competitive and decentralized manner. You can invest in other portfolios or have others invest in yours. So far there is only a GreenPaper (technical specs) [on github.](https://github.com/melonproject/greenpaper)+ **Trader Hot Take:** Super difficult to find detailed information about. But from *Smith and Crown -* A maximum of 1.25 million MLN to support this crowdsale and a future one to support additional phases of work. 500,000 are available. 150,000 slated founders, advisors, and corporate partners will be locked and non-tradable for two years or until Melon is fully deployed. 100,000 tradable tokens will be created for the Melonport company to use. 500,000 will be kept in reserve for a future crowdsale.A decentralized hedge fund with lower limits for entering, reduced overhead costs, and more transparent operations. It is not predicted to launch until February 2018, so at this point it is all speculation in my opinion. #**Swarm City**+ **Ticker:** SWT+ **Website:** https://swarm.city/+ **Subreddit:** r/SwarmCity/+ **Current Marketcap:** $16,739,907+ **Current Price:** $2.53 (1.72%)+ **Brief:** In the Swarm City ecosystem users will only be able to transact with Swarm City tokens (SWT) running on the Ethereum blockchain. With Terminal, users can now send and receive SWT directly from their personal contract. Terminal will be the foundation for transacting in future Swarm City projects such as ‘needaride’ and ‘swarmbnb’. [The release of Boardwalk is the second part of their platform](https://press.swarm.city/swarm-city-boardwalk-overview-9a362f19411f) after Terminal and will allow users to make some basic peer-to-peer transactions with SWT. + **Trader Hot Take:** Personally, I am wary of their business model, because as of now, it seems to be recreating existing types of sharing services, but simply tweaks them by using blockchain technology. Especially when the honeymoon phase of companies like Uber and AirBnb are coming to a close and we begin to see that there are in fact downsides to the sharing economy. That being said, the sharing economy is not going away and I believe it can expand beyond just ‘share a ride’ or ‘stay at my house.’ It could expand into microlending or the gigs sections of craigslist for all I know. Maybe some users could weigh in on what they see in this token. #**Singular DTV**+ **Ticker:** SNGLS+ **Website:** https://singulardtv.com/+ **Subreddit:** /r/SingularDTV/+ **Current Marketcap:** $92,031,600+ **Current Price:** $0.153386 (-8.90%)+ **Brief:** Singular DTV is a content production and distribution platform built on Ethereum. The goal is not only to create and broadcast quality film and TV content but also to reshape the entertainment industry into a more fair, efficient and transparent business thanks to blockchain and smart contract technology. The initial project plan consists of several parts – an original television series, a documentary division, a digital rights management (DRM) platform built on Ethereum, and a video-on-demand portal based around Ethereum. Couldn’t find the whitepaper, [but this seems semi-adequate](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what-is-singular-dtv/)+ **Trader Hot Take:** So when I first read this mission statement, I had flashbacks to this documentary call *[We Live in Public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XSTwfdFwIY)* where a 90’s dot com mogul tries to invent TV on the internet. In the movie, the guy is way ahead of his time and is kind of a boner so he fails miserably. But after digging and reading about SNGLS, I stand completely corrected. If anyone can revolutionize something, it is them. I don’t think anyone saw what Netflix would become 15 years ago, and this could potentially be true here as well. Especially in the entertainment and media industry, where there are many opportunities to be had.   #**Etheroll**+ **Ticker:** DICE+ **Website:** https://etheroll.com/+ **Subreddit:** r/etheroll+ **Current Marketcap:** $14,767,192+ **Current Price:** $2.11 (19.30%)+ **Brief:** *From the Company* - Etheroll is an Ethereum dice game which is provably-fair, has a low 1% house edge and no sign-ups or deposits. Each dice roll is provably random and crypto-graphically secure thanks to the nature of the Ethereum blockchain. It is also relies on random.org a third party for its randomness. Players can set their own odds using our unique web-based UI. [Whitepaper here](https://crowdfund.etheroll.com/etheroll-whitepaper.pdf)+ **Trader Hot Take:** It’s Gambling!

Their devices feature a low-footprint crypto-embedded operating system built for Secure Elements and Secure Enclaves, called BOLOS. What we announce today is the Oraclize “Ledger proof”. By using the hardware attestation feature provided by BOLOS, it is possible to prove to a third party the correct execution of dedicated applications running on Ledger devices. Those proofs are designed to be verifiable on the EVM, enabling smart contracts to establish their validity before the data-dependent execution.#It also uses some ""Oracle"" to create its random numbers out of the ones it gets form random.orgThis costs some ETH everytime it is used and therefore there is not a 1% profit form every won bet. For small bets there even is a loss atm.#So to ELI5 - ETH is the power grid, and these tokens are the devices that run off the power that ethereum provides. Each token is unique developed by its own team. You can do lots of things with tokens like gambling, betting on online gaming, investing, or paying a stranger to drive you to Taco Bell. Some of these tokens are still in the idea phase, so by buying the first coins offered (ICO) you are simply investing in the company. If you are trading coins that have already been issued then you are betting whether the project will become popular/useful/more successful. The price people are willing to pay for these tokens goes up and down based partly on these guesses, and they are listed on exchanges so people can buy and sell them to each other easily. ELI21 - If you are interested in buying into any of these tokens, read the whitepaper about the project. If it sounds like a good idea to you, then find an exchange where it is listed and buy it with some ETH. I was planning on making a Part 2 to this later about how to buy tokens on exchanges. #Ethereum is a distributed computing or smart contract system. It's not a currency, Ethereum is the system. It does have its own currency, ether, however. Ethereum also allows you to create smart contracts that control tokens. These tokens can represent anything you want, anything you can write a program for. Tokens may be like stock in a company, or votes on how a project is run, or the currency used to pay for the service that the smart contract provides. But they can be anything you program them to be. Generally, we expect that they'll increase in value if a project is successful. So it's similar to speculating in stocks. #Depends on the token and where the are listed. Easiest way for the bigger coind is to go through shapeshift.io. It's also possible to get some/most of them on the big exchange like poloniex. The newer and/or smaller coins are only possible to get at the ICO or some really small exchanges. DICE for example is only available on etherdelta.#95% of the 20 million total will be issued to users as an incentive. #according to http://coinmarketcap.com/GNO has $250million market cap#Sia isn't an Ethereum token. #Dai is the stablecoin. It's not out yet. The counter-coin, MKR, is available. That will profit if Dai succeeds. #Why would I mind? Just a disclaimer, I am not related to the project in any way, just a small holder and a fan.#It's an Ethereum token, but just doesn't follow the ERC20 standard.#except you'd be diversified if something happens in the future. and you'd be a bit better protected against dips#Exactly. Even normal video games will boost it's price with the exponential increase in graphic quality.#With over 12,000 ether wagered in less than a month with no advertising, we are working to reduce costs and improve the speed of our game results, these are [two high priority items](https://etheroll.wordpress.com/2017/05/08/3-6-month-development-roadmap-week-2-soft-launch-review/) for us. Metropolis will have market based gas prices and there are neat tricks in the pipeline from the Ethereum team which will also impact gas prices. Gas prices have risen dramatically recently relative to the price of ether, for example, the median cost for a simple send transaction has risen from ~2c to over ~7c in recent times: http://ethgasstation.info. FYI: DICE token boasts 100% profit share among our valued token holders, something which we are very proud of.#Thank you for the reply! Im still not understanding clearly...Nor am I interested in investing into the tokens in particular...Im just trying to get a good understanding of anything I can.So if these tokens do certain things based on the company they are ""from"" or ""representing"" wouldnt they really just be a small chunk of eth?

Technologies will come and go, but the fundamentals help you pick up different technologies incredibly fast. My recommendation is to focus on the fundamentals for now then branch out into what interests you. #Web development.Server-side (""back-end"") or Client-side (""front-end""). Web development has been popular, is currently popular, and will be popular in the future.Relational databases as well. ""Big Data"" is the bigger buzz word right now but there are far more positions looking for experience with relational databases than non-relational databases.Web development and relational databases might not be the ""cool"" technology but they are the most employable technologies.#Cybersecurity might interest you - vulnerability research, exploit development, reverse engineering might not be too big a pivot from embedded C.#Rather than trying to teach yourself something totally new, I'd play to your strengths. You're mostly done with an EE degree right? So choose an area of CS that complements electrical engineering. Try and build something cool that uses some kind of embedded system -- maybe hook up a Raspberry Pi to a bunch of sensors and do some low-level processing on the data or something.To give you an example -- I have a degree in CS and interviewed last week for a large engineering firm's Aeronautical team. The job title was ""software developer"", and it was working on writing software for UAVs. You needed to have a good understanding of low-level system stuff and be able to program in C. When I interviewed, they really wanted to know my experience working in C/C++ and my experience doing systems-level programming on embedded projects. If this kind of thing sounds interesting to you, just do some projects where you're exposed to low-level embedded stuff that lets you apply your EE knowledge, then you can target Embedded SWE jobs after graduating and talk about your past projects and really impress them.#If you have a strong fundamentals in EE and in software we're pretty much always looking for good Embedded developers.  Not as flashy as Web/Apps but the toolchains and knowledge are much more stable and transferable.If you've got a good understanding of C & C++ programming, interrupts, bitwise operators, using a debugger, and how to read a schematic it's pretty easy to get a job in embedded.I'd recommend picking up either an MSP430 or an ARM Cortex M core based devkit (<$40) and playing around with it. NXP, TI, and STM all make good low end dev boards.  Software drivers and support varies greatly though, mostly community driven if you're not a company.#Whatever you're doing as a far as software or running anything goes, you'll have to run it on _some_ sort of an OS. And most decent OSes _aren't_ windows. Boot an Ubuntu box and learn how to run a program - any program. Install CentOS and run a webserver (apache). If you've got the time, take a look at the BSD's. Either way, it's necessary to know what you're running stuff on.#Seems like your time is better spent networking than studying a topic that you are only interested in as a resume builder. I'm sure there is a community that's into embedded C programming for microcontrollers that you can join. This will lead to more job opportunities than studying a new topic for you. But if you want to get familiar with SQL, by all means, follow your interest. Just remember, hiring decisions are made by people and people hire others based on personal relationships and recommendations. #Tech moves so fast that you'll have to be constantly learning if you want to stay competitive, so having strong foundation is the best thing you can do when preparing for the long-term future.In terms of specifics, however, check out the [2017 O'Reilly Software Development Salary Survey](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/2017-software-development-salary-survey). While it's focused on salaries, it has some good insights into where the industry seems to be headed in terms of languages and tools. It should help solve the issue you're having of being unsure where the industry is and will be. As a student I have the same issue you're having, so I don't know how well this represents the industry and I would love input on it, but I thought it was helpful. Good luck!#No one is very good at predicting the future of the software job market but if the IoT stuff takes off, that industry will be built on top of low-power systems interacting with novel IO devices.

They're all hot. Can't go wrong in this economy. But the very best thing to specialize in is anything else. Join the software farm at google and you'll be competing with the very best programmers, grinding out code. Join Intel and you'll be a god. An EE who can actually program is rare, but so necessary. There's three big companies in town that do EDA: Cadence, Mentor and Synopsys. All good choices for an internship. After that, you're golden anywhere in the semiconductor industry. Or you could start at Cisco doing embedded systems, which you can do at 1000 smaller companies, even startups if you like risk. Work on self-driving cars at Google, Tessa and 10 more.

As analysing runtime gets trickier, so does the math involved. Knowing your way around graph theory is helpful as it croups up in many places. There are purely functionaly datastructures. There are approximation algorithms. There is AI and planning. So much to discover and nothing will be ever be worthless unlike the currently cool web framework.#[deleted]#In the last 10 years I have unexpectedly become a Data Engineer, and have found the experience to be highly satisfying as well as perpetually in-demand in recent years. Do note that there is a distinction between being a Database Engineer, a Data Warehouse Engineer, a Data Analyst, a Data Scientist, and a Data Engineer. Though the field is difficult to define, in my mind Data Engineering is the art of building features and functionality out of large and/or disparate sources of data. In my case I have largely worked on building data pipelines and business rule engines, and have found no shortage of interesting projects to work on.#Jennifer Widom offers an excellent course on Databases and SQL on Stanford Lagunita. #I don't care what you focus on, make sure you throw a little SQL learning in with it.#In short, not really if you want to do it well.Buy a book on programming (I'd say java or python is a good place to start) and a book on data structures, try to program all of the data structures you encounter. If that goes well, buy a book on databases, learn SQL and read about how they work. In general, most of software engineering in general (and databases in particular) is based on CS fundamentals applied in clever ways.Briefly, a relational database uses indexed tables to represent relationships between concepts in data. They're the standard way of managing large amounts of information. A non-relational database uses some other thing to represent those relationships, and is usually better for more varied data and running databases ""horizontally"" across multiple servers than a relational database. Non-relational methods are newer and solve use-cases that relational databases are not as useful for.#>what do you mean by career in relational databases?!Depends on the job you want to do. Do you want to be a database administrator/DBA? Learn how to work with SQL or SQL derivatives like MySQL.Want to be a database engineer? You're going to need to learn how to program and the fundamentals of computer science as they will be crucial to understanding a course(s) on database architecture. >i dont mean by studying every dam minute of my life in my free time... just by learning 1day or a few hours a week during 1year or less to change career ?!You can learn at whatever pace you wish to learn at, whether that's an hour a day or just a few hours a week. However it's important to note that you're looking to build skills to make yourself qualified to get a job in these particular fields. Whether you just learn SQL really well and how to manage it or learn database architecture, more time is better than less. One of my skills outside of programming (I'm still very much a novice myself) and understanding of computer networking is my ability to cook. I've been doing it for over a decade. I'm at a point where I can confidently make a dish without looking at a recipe, I can build a budget or meal plan for people, and I even know a lot of the chemistry that occurs behind food. However I wouldn't be at the level of skill I am today if I didn't put in a lot of practice by cooking for myself several times a week over that decade-long period of time.Again, you can learn at your own rate but the most detrimental thought you can have is the idea of getting a job without putting in much hard work studying and building stuff. You may be able to get into a position even at the rate you are currently planning to study at but your growth in positions will stagnate if you don't keep learning. You shouldn't overwhelm yourself of course, so start off at a steady rate, just an hour a day or so but try to work out of the mindset of ""I don't want to spend a lot of time studying this stuff/having to build all this crap"". Doing so might make you stretch out how often you study because ""I'm too tired today, I'll just do it tomorrow"". Treat this stuff like exercise: no matter how tired you are, put in your little bit of work each day or at least several times a week (e.g. something like 8 hours a week).>also what is the difference between relational and non relational databse?!It has to do with how data is stored in the database. This is largely an architectural question and should be reserved for when you learn more about programming and computer science. Relational databases like MySQL store data in tables and rows. Non-relational databases like MongoDB store data in other formats such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). #Business analyst can be working with sql queries all days at some companies and you can probably switch to it pretty easily. Then from there you can be dba or the like as you're spending your whole day writing sql queries you will want to learn about indices etc then you will get qualified.#You can try [overthewire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/) if you want a good start.

Thanks for the info man!#[This](http://discrete.gr/complexity/) seems a good start to me, it analyses graphical algorithms.> ... really confusing ...It is so because if you do runtime anaylsis regorously, it is basically a mathematical proof. As with all of those, they may seem intimidating at first, but really just take some practice to get used to. I suggest that you at least play around with the rigorous approach.Later in professional life, the analylsis is much more informal and based on gut feeling. (But you can feel much more secure if you know that you could proove it in a strict way.) Situations where runtime analysis pop up are pretty rare in my experience.#Blessed be#Sure, fire away.#Probably a year at that rate. However I haven't looked at many database job requirements nor heard many people talk about what to expect when it comes to interviews. I'd recommend you seek out Youtube and Google around for database engineers and/or database administrators to get a feel for where they were at competency-wise before applying for jobs or at the very least being considered.I can point you in the direction of Kris Wenzel from Essential SQL for learning how to work well with SQL: https://www.essentialsql.com/programs/#It varies. But, a lot of the time business analysts will be looking at a database and answering questions to help solve the business. I have limited experience working as one but when I did it was pretty much SQL querying all day. I know there are also business analysts that don't do as much sql stuff and are more involved with just understanding and writing business processes.#1 year to become a dba? or like a clerk?also i am not interested in hardware and server i mostly eant to work with excel, data, do ETL, clean data, automate some process or create spreadsheet, etc... is this what a dba does?#and can you get an entry level position with just basic SQL?!or are you expected to have a deep understanding of database structure and have a CS degree and industry experience?!Can you describe an ordinary day?!and o pros and con (what you liked disliked?!)and thank you alot!! i didn't evne knew such a role existed before today!!is programming like in R, Python, is mandatory too?!Is it stressfull?! what kind of company would hire a buisness analyst?!do you work as a team?! or you are solo?! how big is a departement of buisness analyst?!Is high statistical knowledge required?is there a lot of overtime? and deadline?do you work mostly internally or do you also work with customer, externally?is it always the same query that people ask about? do you do reporting too?!  what if you don't know how to do something will your supervisor help or you are on your own?!#I'm not sure. As I said, I have not looked much into database administrator roles. My background is networking, not databases. However here is what Indeed says about the job role:https://www.indeed.com/hire/job-description/database-administratorYour metric of what you need to know would be better by looking at job postings and seeing what skillsets they're looking for. You can do some DBA jobs just punching in info or having to maintain security and focus on the complexity of the database. Other jobs might have you working as an all-around IT worker, dealing with desktop support, managing servers, etc. It all depends on the companies hiring and what kind of worker they are looking for (and whether you  want to apply to them or not).#I think BA can have a lot of different 'typical days' and it depends a lot on the company.If you know enough SQL to write queries (which doesn't take a long time to learn but does require the ability to think logically) you should be able to get hired entry level. (Of course they are probably looking for business degree but in reality nothing is used so it's up to you to get the job and believe in yourself). Basically, the sql from sqlzoo.net was enough for me to learn most but you'd probably want to study even more.R, Python were not mandatory or even used by the BAs I know. It's like how many people are performing activity X and of those let's break it down by their demographics. To figure that out you need to write a query in a DB of all the actions users are taking. Then, you'll report that number and make a recommendation for how to change the business based on it. (e.g. we should target 35-50 year old women because our competitors are capitalizing on them but they are not leading to sales for us).For me, people needed answers to ad hoc queries and for the higher ups they would be asking their own queries so they could decide what the business shoudl do.#how much time sounds i study before service cv?  also are you sure they job firms is buisness analyst?  job description sounds like they are looking for mba or people with lots of industry experience or lots of programming experience.Also what is the difference between FP&A and Buisness Analyst?!#Just learn it.

The way you type it's like you expect this is going to fall in your lap. Do research, a business analyst can sometimes be called 'systems analyst' or computer systems analyst. The job descriptions are always going to be more than you think and you have to ask yourself if you can actually perform their function. Once you can do the job, exaggerate whatever you have to to get it. If you can fill the job requirements the employer will be happy.#won't they train me? if i have the basic?#Why would I hire someone I need to train when I can hire someone that knows it already?They can hire a CS grad.

Gamepress had one for a while, but I think the widely accepted method is to find pokestops, and lure them up constantly, and own a go plus and spam that while you evolve with a lucky egg, and save lucky eggs for evolving only. Keep in mind everyone has different phones, so some methods will have slightly different results as far as true efficiency.3. Yeah I am with you on this one. But this should be lumped into biome mechanics.4. I stopped keeping track of these once I got all my evolves done, evolved my level 1 of each form also, and still have 5 evo items of each just in case. I literally throw them out now. So I am zero help on this one!#Some data for your #4 suggestion.I work all day on Sunday and always get my 7th day pokestop bonus from the same stop near my work on that day and everytime I get an upgrade, it's quite annoying really.#i'm still not sure about eggs and evo items... i strongly believe eggs are biome biased, from personal experience of course. if we had a way of marking eggs on our bags would be easier to look further into it.. evo items are a bit less biased but still in my home area i tend to get a lot more king's rock and sun stones than in my university, where i tend to get more upgrades and metal coats..#I've observed that the first 6 pokemon is chosen as a counter to the highest CP pokemon's type. For example if the top 'mon is a Dragonite then the counters are rock and electric type for its flying type, so the game finds 6 pokemon with rock or electric type moves (not necessarily rock/electric type pokemon) Also I think it takes into consideration that the charge move is prioritized, not the quick move. So when all of this is combined you see an Omastar with Water Gun/Ancient Power or an Arcanine with Fire Fang/Wild Charge as a suggestion on the first 6 because it thinks you would like a rock/electric type move against the Dragonite. But of course when this is a lvl 10 gym those suggestions mean nothing as there are 9 other pokemon before that dragonite with different types, so on the screen it seems just stupid and random that the game even suggests them.#I *really* want to know this one, because there is little to no information on it.#I favorite what I use the most, and it auto populates these weighted strongly when I fight (I can get my 21xx Tangela to show up at times if the defenders are water heavy, but only when I favorite him)If a rhydon shows up, I either reconsider why I havent transfered it, or put it in a gym asap, or let it stay fainted. I wish I knew why those were valued so much. If the gym is Blissey heavy, I get tons of Rhydon, but most of mine not in gyms are Rock Smash, and they have high attack stat, and fighting damage (ignoring the obvious fact that the STAB bonus and SE bonus are the same, thus using Mud tickle^^ is just as effective, if not slightly higher due to moveset DPS) is strong against normal, so we end up with tons in there because at that CP, there is zero access to good fighting movesets. Machamp is good, but Bullet Punch makes me cry, so Rhydons get selected.#Pretty sure it's been thoroughly debunked by now#But it's the answer to everything!#There's a situation where you get double buddy candies? O.O#Nothing. I don't see nothing. I don't hear nothing. I don't know nothing.#This isn't the most efficient method as you can evolve around 80 Pokemon in 30 minutes, amounting to ~80k exp. But at least you're having fun instead of mindlessly pressing evolve!#I don't know if I believe that evolution items are biome-based buuuuuut...where is your home area, generally?  I'm one Sun Stone away from a full regional dex and my local pokestop has given me Up-Grades three weeks in a row.#There should be a megathread where we all submit the gym lineup, their moves, auto selected team, their moves and someone with a lot of time on their hands to correlate it#Yes, but, what is the right question?#Yes, but it doesn't happen very often. I got double candy on Snorlax twice in ~3000km, 1st time in september and 2nd time in february. There has been multiple threads on reddit with people getting double candies. It's not really known if it's a bug or some kind of very rare RNG feature. #If you had a go+ you could be catching Pokemon and spinning stops while mass evolving. If you do it first thing in the morning you get the daily/weekly bonus. And since you are walking there is a good chance of hatching an egg or two..To further expand on the topic of maximizing game play, I would like to see an economic model of the entire game developed. The model is a set of equations where time plus a set of input resources and conditions will produce output resources and/or conditions. The model can then be used to search for optimal paths to achieve any result.#If you time lucky egg popping, streaks, and Pokemon go plus you can easily heal 100k an egg.#Yes, but my strategy can be sustained endlessly, while just evolving needs many hours grind before you can do anything.In my experience I had more success when combining catching and evolving compared to doing them seperately. While catching, spinning and so on there are downtimes where nothing is there and I didnt want them to be unused.#around verdun, man.. got 7 of those on the past 2 weeks#Holy crap that sounds fantastic!#It's easier to test for what it isn't. For instance, is the selection repeatable? Do you get the same selection if you restart the app and start a gym two or three times in a row? If repeatability is confirmed, it makes it a lot easier to look for what changes the selection.#7*6#I was under the impression that this was just a bug which occurred if you hatched an egg at the same time as receiving the candy and despite 2 appearing on the screen you only receive one.#I've noticed the plus doesn't work while in an encounter, does it work while evolving?#Ah, I see where you're coming from. I guess that's a more viable method if you have lots of lucky eggs!#Thanks.  I might as well give it a try.#Thank you again, kind stranger!! Today was my 7 day streak and--whether the biome effect is real or I just got lucky--Verdun metro gave me a Sun Stone! Heading home now to do some evolving.#I'm tempted to start one, but with the gym rework coming I'll wait and see if they have a new system.#It is hinted that adding a favorite star to your pokemon increases the chance to be selected more often.#I assume you mean 6*9?#It also happens without being in sync with eggs. The last itime it happened to me wasn't either a case of distances update lagging. It went that way :* 12h05, complete 5km with buddy, get Snorlax candy (egg at 3.5km)* 12h25, complete the 5km for egg, egg hatches (=distance properly updated), buddy at 1.5km on the next candy distance* 13h00, complete the 5 km for the buddy, get 2 candies (really got 2). I didn't get a negative distance though, everything was done cleanly.#It has been [reported](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/537yv0/spent_a_few_hours_with_the_pokemon_go_plus_heres/d7rgj14/) that it does.#I get 100 coins per day from gyms and buying in bulk lucky eggs are 50 coins each so I have 2 per day on average if I dont buy anything else. I use 1 (or 2) per day and save the rest of the coins for events.#haha good to know, man.. congrats!#The favorites do appear more often to the lineup. It is very easy to notice. I deselect my favorites before evolving since favoriting the mons I want to evolve and develop. Only after deselecting my top mons from favorites some mons I havn't favorited appear in the lineup. E.g. when there are several Dragonites in the gym my wild caught high cp throwaway Jynx appear in the lineup even though they never appear when my top mons are favorited.#How many roads must a man walk down? OBVIOUSLY#Sorry about the downvotes, the people doing it must not have ever read the books"
Cricket;6cja17;1495403871.0;/r/Cricket/comments/6cja17/10_years_of_ipl_an_analysis_of_trends_and/;10 years of IPL - an analysis of trends and statistics [OC];"G'day cunts, benchods, poms, fellow sheepshaggers and all other cricket fans throughout the world. I'm currently writing my thesis, which isn't due until January, so naturally I find as many ways to procrastinate as I can. I've always been a big fan of cricket stats, and I often see the question asked in match threads ""Is it just me or are totals getting higher/lower every IPL?"". Well, I've decided to see for myself, by amalgamating totals for every single game to see what has changed over the past ten years of IPL.A NOTE ON LIMITATIONS: As a human being I am bound to have made a typo at least at some point in my spreadsheets, but hopefully a sample size of 60/78 helps iron out any small differences.#THE BIG PICTURE Among completed games in the IPL there have been:-192,768 runs -7407 wickets-24,077.1 oversGiving us an average:-Run rate of 8.00 (and thus an average score of 160)-Bowling SR of 19.50-Bowl average of ~26.03 (ignoring byes and LB)#Trends##Match totals[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/Idnc31I.png)A slight upward trend is noted in average match totals since 2008. Indeed, 2017 had the highest average total of any IPL. Perhaps unsurprisingly IPL 2009, held in SA, had the lowest average total by quite some margin. A linear regression plotted against this data shows totals increase by about 1.04 a year, though the R^2 value of 0.31 indicates caution in attributing this trend to time.##Match run rate[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/89DKb0E.png)Not strictly the same as match totals, owing to games where teams are bowled out and to games where totals are chased down in <20 overs. Again we see a slight upward trend, though less clear than with match totals with a R^2 of just 0.23. ##Wickets taken[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/KhfzuVZ.png)A very slight downward trend in the average number of wickets taken per innings, although how much of the apparent trend is due to the anomalous SA IPL is unclear. R^2 of just 0.14##Batting/Bowling average[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/S56dPpS.png) Not strictly either batting or bowling average, as it does not take in to account extras, and is instead simply total/wickets. Perhaps the clearest upward trend so far, with batting average increasing by 0.3 each year at a R^2 of 0.34.##Strike Rate (fielding)[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/ysluUq6.png)Again not strictly a graph of bowling SR since it doesn't take in to account runouts. At best a very slight upward trend in SR, though at a R^2 of 0.15 that seems pretty tenuous. ##Average winning margin[Graph of winning margin in runs](http://i.imgur.com/5PtYRWu.png)[Graph of winning margin in balls left](http://i.imgur.com/HZHwAKA.png)Really nothing trendwise as to whether games are getting closer or not. ##Individual centuries[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/URPiiHQ.png)Definitely no clear trend there. Again 2009 stands out as an outlier. ##200+ totals[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/uqthOCB.png)Two things interesting there, firstly, again the 2009 IPL shows up where only two 200+ totals were achieved. Also interesting is how 2008 had the most 200+ totals, in the first IPL, yet had a relatively low RR/match total suggesting a greater variability in scores.##Bowling 4fers[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/2tl9Bha.png)I chose 4fers because 5fers are too rare and 3fers are harder to count... But as you can see, no real clear trend here either.#ConclusionsIPL has stayed mostly the same throughout its ten year tenure (heh). A slight increase in totals, run rates and batting averages might be possible but as to how significant they are, that's hard to tell. All in all, it seems like much of what we think is changing, be it big bats or better bowling, seems to be in our head!That's all the graphs I can think of, but I've got a big data set containing every total including wickets and balls bowled, if anyone can think of anything else they'd like to see represented. Unfortunately I didn't bother recording which team scored what so I can't say how individual teams have progressed over time, or individual players for that matter.Anyway hope this was interesting for ya'll!";Reading this whilst procrastinating in a Quantitative Analytics lecture on linear regression...makes my procrastination feel validated! This is worthy of r/dataisbeautiful, cheers for sharing!#> G'day cunts, benchods, poms, fellow sheepshaggersDude I get the insults are meant from a place of rapport, but can we hold off the extremely offensive word there? No one deserves to be called a pom. #Two things interesting there, firstly, again the 2009 IPL shows up where only two 200+ totals were achieved.That was the year they had to play the entire IPL in South Africa, due to elections going on in India during that period.#Great stuff. Wish we also had data about spectator gate count and viewers count to see how much the increase has been and if losing teams(RR & CSK) has had any impact at all or not. #Cheers! Glad you found it interesting.#Why couldn't they play cricket during elections? Doesn't seem like they are mutually exclusive activities.#this we need this ! how many people watched the god-damn thing?!we seem to have no data since 2015#Police security has to be provided for the election  government might not be able to spare any for the matches.#Yea true, I know India is an industrialized developing nation but had always thought of it as more stable than that. Always interesting discovering I'm more sheltered than I'd believed.#The government itself is very stable  it is mainly to prevent stuff like booth capturing and undue influence being exerted by political parties. But most elections are conducted very peacefully.#Makes sense, thanks for that.
unitedkingdom;6ge2sj;1497079997.0;/r/unitedkingdom/comments/6ge2sj/why_mays_campaign_failed_and_corbyns_succeeded_in/;Why May's campaign failed and Corbyn's succeeded in 3 charts;Having read several articles analysing the campaigns, this one from the BBC stand out as the best.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40222733Two charts in the article show exactly where the error occurred for the Tories. The first one shows as dots the constituencies where May visited against the 2015 Tory/Labour poll lead on the X axis and the 2015 UKIP vote share on the Y.https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/16F09/production/_96416939_may_catastrophe_1.pngThe next is the same chart with the dots recoloured to show the results in 2017. Notice the dots that switched from blue to red are in the small cluster that the conservative completely missed.https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/120E9/production/_96416937_may_catastrophe_2.pngFurther down, you can see the same chart, but where Corbyn visited was highlighted instead -https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/0173/production/_96417300_labour_dat_1-1.pngNotice the clustering around where May completely neglected. Corbyn was spot on and visited the right places more or less.The conservatives got their polling completely wrong and their pollsters even ridiculed YouGov for their 'outlier' results.Kudos to YouGov for their MRP model. It seems like big data is indeed the future in polling as voter preferences are increasing difficult to gauge via the old methods.;"The irony is that yougov is a Tory organisation. Many Tory voters were highly critical of it, there was even a joke meme about the 'relationship is over' on r/ukpol. They've been spot on and cusps to them. This should prove to people that there are sources out there willing to be bi-partisan and believe in their research.#I remember people saying this would be a Tory landslide precisely because May was targeting Labour seats#Isn't there an element of the tail wagging the dog in this analysis?Had the Tories had a successful campaign the ""frontier"" would've been in the battleground they were fighting in. As it was, labour controlled the discussion and so controlled where the battleground was. #This is what I was worried about before the election.  May would win, but Corbyn would lose well enough that his supporters would feel some kind of moral victory and develop a satisfaction with failure.Corbyn's campaign did not succeed, the point is to become the government.  He is not Prime Minister.  Instead, as things stand, we have the Tories and the DUP.  It's probably the worst outcome I can imagine.#Ukpol was all over the place. They were an eco chamber of ""salty left wing tears coming in"" but now they're silent. Twats#If their polling was right, they would be focusing closer to where the real battleground constituencies were. You would see May visiting about the same places as Corbyn's cluster. The fact that they didn't means that they thought these places were safe, when they were far from it. #> Corbyn's campaign did not succeed, the point is to become the government. He is not Prime Minister. Instead we have the Tories and the DUP. It's probably the worst outcome I can imagine.Sometimes the best play is to pass.There is absolutely nothing good for Labour to handle Brexit at this stage. It will tear the party apart. Look at the charts above. Labour flipped the most seats where UKIP support was relatively low in 2015.#This is one of the better outcomes that could have happened. First and foremost the sole reason this election was called was because May thought that with her 20 point lead she'd have a 100+ landslide. Corbyn campaigned so well that he cut this down to what was it, 1%? If that's not success then what is. Secondly, look at the changes. Labour took far more off the Tories than the reverse. How on earth corbyn won seats like Kensington or Canterbury is beyond belief. Even seats that weren't won were cut down from a safe seat to a marginal. Amber Rudds seat for instance or Putney where the majority was cut from 10k to less than a thousand with little to no Labour campaigning. Further, May lost a majority. A majority.  In the eyes of the public she's been weakened whilst corbyn has had an image boost that will help in the future. May having to form a deal with the DUP is going to rip apart the Tories, especially with the socially liberal lot in there who aren't homophobic or racist as the DUP are. The DUP also threaten the NI peace as the Tories aren't shown impartiality in the good friday agreement. There are so many good points to take away from this. #To be honest I stay out of there, but 48hrs running up to the election most of the top posts were quite readable, the comments were light hearted and no one was giving Corb a hard time or May an easy ride. The top post (for me) is currently https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/6g8x6k/looks_like_well_be_sending_brussels_the/#Ukpol ebbs and flows. It depends on whether the hardcore Brexiters/Liberterians are out in full force. Right now, most of them are sulking.#You're assuming the the public's voting intention is constant, and wasnt effected by the actions of the parties. May might have been visiting the correct constituencies as things stood at the start of the campaign, but the ground moved under her. It would be interesting to have a time aspect in the chart to see if they acknowledged the changing battle ground in any way. #Could not agree more, Brexit is a poison chalice, if or when it goes horribly sideways the party in power will be out for a generation #Yeah, that right there is the attitude I was talking about.  Satisfaction with failure.  ""Yay, we lost!""  Like, what the fuck?#>   If that's not success then what is.Actual success.>Further, May lost a majority. I'd honestly prefer her to have a small majority over being in coalition with the DUP.From my perspective:Glorious Caroline Lucas majority >  Corbyn majority > Corbyn coalition > Tory majority so we get a different Labour leader > where we're at > Left wing parties getting totally wiped out.So short of like a 450 Tory seat parliament, this is as bad as it gets for me.>There are so many good points to take away from this.All of which are ifs and coulds and maybes.  What if May's leadership falls apart, and a Tory leader who isn't May fights an election against Corbyn in October?  This don't they don't fuck it all up like they did before, and they do actually gain a majority and we get 5 years.  Any of the contenders for the Tory leadership can do better than May.  David Davis would be a particular threat to Corbyn's ""I'd like to have a beer with him"" brand.Losing is not victory.  Failure is not success.#>pyrrhic1>ADJECTIVE>>(of a victory) won at too great a cost to have been worthwhile for the victor.Negotiating Brexit with razor thin majority in Parliament after losing seats in a snap election with full-on right-wing press backing? That'll cement the Tory reputation for a generation.#You seem to be thinking that winning this general election was the be all and end all to politics, and that what happens next isn't going to shape British politics for at least a generation.#They won 30 more seats and the Tories lost 13, they increased their share of the vote by more than any Labour party since 1945, they have made May look like a weak and stupid leader, they have forced the Tory party to scramble around for support from extremists to stay in power (something that may well come back to haunt them next time), they defied all expectations reducing a 25 point lead in the polls to a 1 point lead, they have destroyed the Tory manifesto as they have no mandate for it anymore, they have made Tory MPs question their leader and some are calling for her head, and they have made sure there will be another election before 2022. It is a fantastic result for Labour.#> From my perspective:> Glorious Caroline Lucas majority &gt   Corbyn majority &gt  Corbyn coalition &gt  Tory majority so we get a different Labour leader &gt  where we're at &gt  Left wing parties getting totally wiped out.I, and i think a lot of others, would put Tory majority one step lower in your list.  A Tory majority was driving the country full speed in the wrong direction. We've put the brakes on. May now has to talk to people to decide on a direction. Yes the DUP are the wrong people to talk to, but it won't last. May won't be able to offer them much. The DUP will overreach and it'll collapse. At that point we've got another GE which the Tories will lose because they've been shown to be week and wobbly. #You know what's even worse than a pyrrhic victory?  A defeat.#>You seem to be thinking that winning this general election was the be all and end all to politicsNo, I seem to be thinking that winning this election was the be all and end all of *this election*.  This wasn't a successful campaign.  It just wasn't.  Labour lost.  Were there encouraging signs?  Can he win another in the future?  Sure.  Did he succeed in this one?  No, absofuckinglutely not.  It's crazy to say that he did.  He lost the election.#You're only thinking short term and politics is far more strung out than that. Conservative popularity and unity is damaged, Brexit will harm them further. It's not the best outcome but it isn't a loss#Losing a battle but winning the war. Progressive vote share is over 50% and the Tories have been relegated to the right cannibalising the UKIP vote.#> this electionSure, but the context of this election was extraordinary. A PM with a small majority *only called the election* because everyone was sure she's win by a landslide to strengthen her hand for Brexit negotiations and she lost her majority. She fucked up massively, her career is on a knife edge. The Tories are basically in a no-win position now - if she limps on she'll be crucified, if she's replaced we'll have another Tory leadership challenge, the same questions of the legitimacy of the government, lots of infighting, Brexit negotiations will suffer, it's hard to see them coming out of it looking good.> It's crazy to say that he did. He lost the election.Nobody is saying that. But people have been saying for ages that whoever is in charge during Brexit negotiations will lose a lot of support because it can't end well. *If* you believe that (and not everyone does, of course), Labour have avoided the poisoned chalice and are in the best possible position to capitalise on the Tories' problems.#>It's not the best outcome but it isn't a lossOther than in the sense that it's quite literally a loss.#>Losing a battle but winning the war. We're talking about the battle though.  The title is about this campaign.  Her campaign was successful, his was not.  Was she an idiot for calling it?  Sure.  But she's the PM right now, and he is not.  I don't recognize any definition of success that isn't based on getting in to Number 10.  That's the point of a campaign.#> it's hard to see them coming out of it looking good.I'm not implying that this is some kind of roaring triumph, I'm saying that Theresa May's campaign succeeded, and Corbyn's failed.  His was a particularly good form of failure, and hers was a particularly bad form of success, but let's not ignore that one person won, and one did not.People who are interested in Labour government should not be acting like this was a good day.>Nobody is saying that. Whole post is about how Corbyn actually succeeded.#I don't think you're listening to what people are saying#I like how you completely ignore the point of what s/he said.#Her campaign in her own words was to increase her majority to negotiate Brexit, not just to win the election.She lost seats./serious faceplamThe Tories 'won' the election but lost the campaign.#Again, you're completely ignoring the context.If the Greens won 20 seats everyone would be calling it a success even if they were nowhere near winning.#I'm listening.  That's why I'm able to disagree.#>The Tories 'won' the election but lost the campaign.There's nowhere I can go from there.  Like if someone told you ""triangles have 4 sides"", what would you do?  I guess you'd give up arguing with them, and that's what I'm going to do now.#Labour are not the Greens.  Labour are supposed to be winning elections.  That's the league they play in.  On top of that, if I were to call the Greens successful for winning 20 seats, I certainly couldn't call the campaign of the party that got in to government in that election a ""failure""#You're not disagreeing, you're just repeating the same thing while ignoring what everyone else is saying.#You really have a black and white view of elections. The Lib Dems never was the biggest party since its formation in the merger. Does it mean that it 'lost' every single campaign? No, it has different goals.Labour did not need to get a majority or even be the biggest party to derail the Tories. Corbyn was successful at completely declawing the Tories and rubbishing their mandate, cementing his own legacy in Labour, and leaving the Tories with no choice but to clean up the mess they made with Brexit.#I don't know if you were paying attention to the last 2 years of British politics, but *nobody* expected Corbyn to get anywhere close to winning the election.6 weeks ago people were calling this election the death of the Labour Party.#/u/Freeloading_Sponger is Maybot 2.0?#>You're not disagreeingI'm quite literally disagreeing.>you're just repeating the same thing while ignoring what everyone else is saying.I'm not ignoring what everyone else is saying, I'm noticing that everyone is saying the same thing over and over, which is why my response is the same over and over.If you want a new response, say something new.#>You really have a black and white view of elections.And to me you're arguing that black *is* white.  Like I say, I just can't be bothered to argue that 2+2=4.#If you concede 6 goals in the first half and score 4 in the second, you lost the match.#Ah the_donald's greatest gift to reddit.  Don't agree with someone?  Well then they're just a bot for the other side.#I'll bite.As a lib dem / green supporter who wanted a labour win / coalition I see this as a second best scenario.Labour majority would have been great but was a little out of reach. Same with a minority and coalition.Tories losing their majority (read ""not winning"") and being forced to get into bed with the hard right with actual links to terrorism and a horrific track record on equality rights is a token ""victory"".Tory supporters expecting a landslide are disillusioned, with most comments revolving around ""salty tears / you lost"". When the reality is, this isnt a fucking football match. We're not picking teams and going yay our side won. This about what's best for the country. What's best for us as a whole. Seeing Mrs May squander a majority and weaken her hand. Hopefully enough to prevent her attack on the NHS, schools. Tax cuts for corporations etc etc and having to deal with Brexit with a minority is the best of a bad situation. I believe there'll be another election around the corner as you cant call a snap election, lose ground, call it a victory and expect to keep control of your party and government.#http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/157/777/1256519926211.jpg#You're arguing that 2+2=4 in a discussion about trigonometry.#I give up.#whoosh.#Feel free.#Except this discussion about trigonometry is titled ""Why 2+2=5"".#Only according to you.#Title is literally ""Why May's campaign failed and Corbyn's succeeded in 3 charts"", and I'm arguing that he didn't succeed.

PPC;6cwo1d;1495565318.0;/r/PPC/comments/6cwo1d/what_my_startup_is_trying_to_solve_for_the_sem/;What my startup is trying to solve for the SEM industry;"Hey everyone,So as hinted in a few recent posts/replies here and there, I'm working on building a startup/platform for the SEM industry. I've been bootstrapping the product since February 2015, and have recently began in-market tests of the technology. First results are interesting.I'm solving for the following problem: Perfect relevancy between user's search queries/intents to ads to landing pages. If you can perfect the relevancy between millions of keyword/queries and ads, you inadvertently should yield higher CTRs/CVRs.EDIT: Hidden MVP candidate feature list, pm me if you'd like to discuss.One campaign I ran sustained a 4.77% avg. CTR with a 23.58% avg CVR. Not bad given that 6,000+ SKAGs were computed in minutes, and little optimization was done once the campaign was launched (so no new negatives added). It did however serve a market/intent where you had to nearly simply click on the CTA to complete the desired intent, it was easy.My most recent test is for an account with 875,000 SKAGs and the results are very different. It's for a brick and mortar business (car repair shop), and this market of course serves a very different market, series of intents, and commitment by searchers. This campaign is requiring a lot more negative management control so that unrelated queries are filtered out. What I did find interesting in this campaign was: yes, people search with very messed up queries that you'd never expect them to search. One of them was something along the lines of ""how much does it cost to paint my 2003 sebring bumper""... c'mon man, Google isn't all that mighty yet to be able to answer that. Our platform would technically be able to compute an ad that would answer that need well-enough that he'd click and land on a landing page which would dynamically adjust itself to answer that need in more detail.These tests and discussions in PPC communities are making me realize that the platform will require a strong form of self-optimization post-SKAG generation. Especially on the side of negative management from search queries + organization of SKAGs between accounts/campaigns + bidding control between BMM + Exact match types.The platform computes what they call a data lake. And it essentially takes away the ability to manually manage a/multiple accounts because there's just too much data (unless we implement granular management tools, which we'd love to :)So my next goal while rebuilding the product again (with better UX in mind), will be to evaluate what kind of mass scale or granular management tools would be needed to satisfy SEM experts. Not everything can be done on a mass scale, and I see this platform as a mass-volume building tool, which can then begin to optimize accounts slowly until goals are met.My next duties are to build a list of next MVP candidate features, and measure whether they satisfy the needs of the market. We're planning to rebuild the technology with usability and scalability in mind next to lower computation costs, and engineer a robust founding architecture for the platform. There will be tens of dozens of services in the codebase, so technology choices our CTO is making are critical for the future success of this platform.My questions to the SEM community will be relating to:* How much account/campaign organization matters vs. how we currently organize data. As stated above:> Managing the distribution of the SKAGs generated between accounts/campaigns. We're generating upwards 1M+ SKAGs which will perform differently from 1 SKAG to the other. The organization of SKAGs will affect account health.* The division between BMM SKAGs which help find new queries, and Exact SKAGs which focus on performance.* Requirements on bidding management (our proprietary algorithms vs. bid management tools provided by AdWords/Bing).* Requirements for implementation of our platform into landing page systems (in house vs. SaaS platforms vs. CMS's etc). Ideally we'd like to build something that can be implemented via API's into any platform, but we understand that in the beginning we may have to build some implementations into existing tools ourselves.* What to keep in AdWords/Bing, and what to bring into our platform (reporting, filtering etc). We don't want to replace AdWords/Bing, but we're afraid that if someone begins to play too much with AdWords/Bing, he may disrupt the economy of what our platform computes. So before we make any decisions on how we'll handle this issue, we really need to speak to the market to understand what day to day tools they'd.I've tried in the past to bring in people to a private Slack channel, but I realized that everyone has their preferences in platforms. Some like Reddit, others like Skype, others like Slack.For the Reddit community I'd like to create a private subreddit and invite anyone and everyone who'd love to contribute thoughts to this product we're building. I'm currently sitting a new account (less than 30 days old), so I have to wait ~2 weeks before I can create the private subreddit (gold member).In the meantime I can begin-with asking some questions here, and gather a list of members that would like to join the high-level conversation in the coming weeks as I prepare the discussion environments.Early thought contributors will get early access to the platform once we roll out the beta.Looking forward to thoughts.Cheers,PPC BrainP.S.

That being said, here are some of my thoughts. > Perfect relevancy between user's search queries/intents to ads to landing pages. If you can perfect the relevancy between millions of keyword/queries and ads, you inadvertently should yield higher CTRs/CVRs.You know the Gretzky quote about going to where the puck will be the future? I feel like your premise is built on a foundation in Search that is radically changing. I could be wrong, but I wonder if tech like this will be relevant at all in 5 years from now. For now, it sounds awesome...but here are my thoughts.I think this might be based on several outdated best practice IMHO.1. Audience and context (i.e. device, location, previous searches, etc...) are telling us much more about intent than queries and keywords can on their own. It's time marketers started thinking about message match as fundamentally different than plugging queries into ads and landing pages. 2. Focusing on long tail and trying to solve relevancy at scale - Aside from the lines being blurred between match types today and Google's continues sophistication in understanding the context of specific queries based on other signals, I wonder if it's time to think about relevancy and message match in the context of CONQUERING ONE KEYWORD AT A TIME. Truly analyzing the SERPs and creating experiences that are so helpful to users that they can't help but engage and convert. (When I say one keyword, I sort of mean, one group of keywords that signals a specific intent, at a specific point in the customer journey). If you are gung ho about optimizing message match, you will see more bang for your buck owning one keyword at a time than dynamically trying to be relevant to thousands or millions of keywords. Outside of the above personal opinions of mine...I think you will run into challenges around budget allocation, risk management, and campaign structures. Specifically, how do you group ad groups into campaigns and focus budget where it can have the biggest impact? Let's say you are promoting two services, one has a 30x value over the other. I would hate to burn through budget on the 1x product that could drive sales for the 30x one. How will your system know how to break up campaigns in a way that lets you optimize budgets effectively? > Building intents (builder which can compute intentions based on rules set).I suppose this is the holy grail if you can build something that actually makes sense. Can you give some examples of intents and how you would map the experience to them? Finally, the biggest challenge you will face is that different organizations have different decision making processes and objectives, and in my experience, structure needs to reflect how the organization will be making decisions about the account, managing and optimizing it, adding services, promotions, campaigns,audiences, extensions, etc... Trying to force your structure on their operations will be like fitting a square peg in a round hole...It won't be easy. All in all though, I think this is a step up from whats on the market today, and would be happy to test on a client. Let me know when you are open to beta testers. Edit: Fixed some formatting.#If you could get all those features to function correctly and effectively then it sounds like it'd be a magical e-commerce machine.! (Next feature would have to be production of virgin unicorns.)Completely above the scale and experience level I'm at, haha. Best of luck!I'll test consumer usability for you.  )#So it's essentially a management platform, without most of the management features that the major platforms have (UI and bulksheet management of assets/reporting/from the sound of it tracking)?One piece of advice is that building out incredibly granular keyword sets doesn't have the same value as it might have 5 years ago. Adwords has been ramping up Low Search Volume disapprovals, meaning that they won't let you serve on obscure keywords even if you have them in your account -- the only way to serve on a random query like ""how much does it cost to paint my 2003 sebring bumper"" will probably be on BMM terms. Behind the scenes, a lot of major companies are scrapping their 10+ million keyword accounts and running on leaner targeting.#Wow this looks like it's going to be amazing! I know it's not quite the same thing but it looks like you're going to be competing with the likes of Doubleclick and Marine which is going to be challenging seeing as though they are already well established names in PPC. Are you planning on being more competitively priced than them? Atleast until you become better established? #good luck on your venture. as for advice, for myself I develop these applications on demand when I need them. Enterprise software is not for me unless there is really some value which I cannot acquire on my own. The end result is always better (and usually much less expensive) if you tailor functions to the exact needs of the account. For you guys you're writing enterprise sw that you hope to distribute to a wide range of customers and accounts. I would tailor and write applications for each individual account as a service, which probably isn't the best business model 😂. These are 2 different scenarios.#This is amazing! The concept alone is awesome, I hope you can execute. If there's anyway to help or beta test I'd love to support👊🏽#Ahhhh. Now I understand the reasoning behind your recent questions. :) Enterprise level software is a different game than individual account management. :) So, in that regard, I don't know if anything I have said over the past couple of weeks actually holds any merit. I just didn't know the context. :) Now I see why the SKAGS approach is necessary to account structure - It's a requirement for the software to function. What is the business model moving forward? Are you managing advertising clients purely to build, and sell the software? Or are you an advertising agency developing software? I think that's a key when it comes to some of the account structure, management, ownership/access, and reporting questions.#I'm interested in what you're building.#Are there any PPC people on your team?#As an aside, I am fairly new to Reddit...

With proper architecture, even in an MVP, this would not have been an issue.#Hey thanks for joining the conversation, I appreciate all input and insights :)> Audience and context (i.e. device, location, previous searches, etc...) are telling us much more about intent than queries and keywords can on their own. It's time marketers started thinking about message match as fundamentally different than plugging queries into ads and landing pages.I agree. But before you can add additional layers of contextual targeting into the mix, I think we first need to solve and make the process of creation super easy while also cleaning up the method to create landing pages / website. I think the web is a disaster (Facebook, Twitter etc are all under one roof, they're under a controlled platform), but the rest of the non-platformed web is messy. Gazillions of pages that are lost, and will never be found by crawlers. And if they are, Google has a long way to clean, organize and rank the data. I'm very doubtful that Google with machine learning can rank a badly structured/written website. Nor do I think that AI is there yet to be able to make field/profession related choices for users. Yeah it might find you a car body shop if you Google ""bumper repair"", but it definitely won't build you an awesome landing page that talks just about bumper repair and their methods. Our approach allows you to take those intent-groups which can maybe hold hundreds of thousands of SKAGs, and point them to a shape of your landing page that'll dynamically adjust itself if they're triggered.Also, I'm doubtful that Google can predict your intent in all markets based on past searches, location etc. For example, if you want some rust repaired on your car right after winter, I highly doubt that it's a query that Google would have much data-for. It's a once every year type of event (if any).I do however find their tech interesting, and I'm very curious where the most successful application will be.> Focusing on long tail and trying to solve relevancy at scale - Aside from the lines being blurred between match types today and Google's continues sophistication in understanding the context of specific queries based on other signals, I wonder if it's time to think about relevancy and message match in the context of CONQUERING ONE KEYWORD AT A TIME.

If you are gung ho about optimizing message match, you will see more bang for your buck owning one keyword at a time than dynamically trying to be relevant to thousands or millions of keywords.We've already solved this with our method. Our intent groups, which are tied to a set of SKAGs in the economy we create, will each trigger different experiences on the landing page. One intent-group may be focused on buyers, while the next is focused on top of funnel intents. And it all happens on 1 landing page, using our method. Yes you can actually inject the query they searched into the landing page -- which is the most I've seen being done with dynamic keyword insertion features by some landing page platform providers... but none have figured out how to use dynamic keyword insertion for other contexts (changing a button's color, changing the shape of the page, changing the order of content, changing the intent of the page etc). The reason why they haven't, is because they haven't designed what our system has already solved. To be truly be able to solve for this, you need a structured method to build intents, and their ads.> If you are gung ho about optimizing message match, you will see more bang for your buck owning one keyword at a time than dynamically trying to be relevant to thousands or millions of keywordsWe own the one keyword, while also dynamically being relevant to thousand or millions of SKAGs :)> Outside of the above personal opinions of mine...I think you will run into challenges around budget allocation, risk management, and campaign structures.

I would hate to burn through budget on the 1x product that could drive sales for the 30x one. How will your system know how to break up campaigns in a way that lets you optimize budgets effectively?This is my next set of features to tackle. All these SKAGs need to be organized in a specific way within campaigns in order for the user to be able to allocate budgets adequately. Right now, we simply sequentially fill campaigns with the SKAGs based on how they were input into our system. But it doesn't mean it needs to stay that way. Each SKAG is its own unique item, and can be moved from one campaign to the other, or another account entirely. I will be asking the community in the coming weeks about the most optimized way to re-group data once performance metrics have kicked in. I'll also ask if many used shared budget features, as it may impact if we'll write our own shared budget distribution algorithms. So I look forward to speaking to you all in regards to these requirements.> I suppose this is the holy grail if you can build something that actually makes sense. Can you give some examples of intents and how you would map the experience to them?Right so we're already have this built in its rawest form using a method that I would ""build"" hundreds of intents manually using our system. I recently built a campaign for a car body shop for the sole purpose of analyzing my patterns. This allowed me to write a bunch of rules/features that'll implement in the MVP which will allow the building of intent-groups within minutes.Once the intents are generated, you need to write ad templates for them. The first method I had come up with was the super granular method. You had to write ad templates for tens to hundreds of intents (depending how many you built.. it could've been 10 intents that generated 875k SKAGs, or 1000 intents that generated 400k SKAGs, it really varies based on how you organize things). What I like about this method is that if you put in the effort (I plan on integrating the ability to divide work between creative experts), you can really write custom templates for each intent. But what I realized is that as I did them one by one, patterns appeared again. I noticed that in certain cases I would generalize my templates and keep them very similar in comparison to others. This made me discover a 2nd method to build out ad templates for all the intents -- which can shortcut the process by 10X and possibly allow the user to yield similar performance results. A lot of my research lately has been on optimizing some of the stages of the building process (especially ad templates), in order to let the computer do much of the heavy lifting for the user. But I'll leave the door open for both methods so that experts can chose their level of granularity/relevance.Once the intents/ad templates are done, the system is ready to validate. It checks for errors (and there's a ton of rules with AdWords/Bing re: their policies for ads, keyword lengths, account limits etc). Once that's all passing, it's ready to compute the data.At any point after the intents are built, can another part of the expert's team be working on the landing page intents. Since you now have the key which represents the intent, you can write the rules into the landing page in order for it to dynamically adjust itself based on what the developer/designer will know be referred by search engines. During a future assessment, I'll need to make choices as to which landing page platform, programming language, CMS we'll first chose to support.> Finally, the biggest challenge you will face is that different organizations have different decision making processes and objectives, and in my experience, structure needs to reflect how the organization will be making decisions about the account, managing and optimizing it, adding services, promotions, campaigns,audiences, extensions, etc... Trying to force your structure on their operations will be like fitting a square peg in a round hole...It won't be easy.I agree. And we also don't plan on supporting all AdWords/Bing features from the get-go, so we're hoping to add enough value with our MVP so that we can lean out some of their creation processes in order to have users be interested in the tech. From there on it's a race to build out the rest of the bells and whistles that most would need.> All in all though, I think this is a step up from whats on the market today, and would be happy to test on a client. Let me know when you are open to beta testers.Thank you, really looking forward to continuing conversations.#It already is functioning  ) now we just gotta align the bells and whistles that'll make SEM experts jump ship to our new method :) any and all insights will be appreciated, so I'll definitely include you in the private subreddit!#Hey thanks for joining the conversation!> So it's essentially a management platform, without most of the management features that the major platforms have (UI and bulksheet management of assets/reporting/from the sound of it tracking)?I wouldn't argue that it's more of a builder at this moment. I think it needs to head towards management, but I'm hoping to automate as much of that as I could. The point was to design a tool that can pump out a ton of of intent-relevant SKAGs/ads, with little effort by the creative professional -- and then automate a lot of the management tasks (while giving him the option to jump in and adjust as needed).> One piece of advice is that building out incredibly granular keyword sets doesn't have the same value as it might have 5 years ago. Adwords has been ramping up Low Search Volume disapprovals, meaning that they won't let you serve on obscure keywords even if you have them in your accountI've recently tested with a large data set for a car body shop business (nearly 875k SKAGs). I went with the deep keyword + wide approach. There was a ton of LSV, I agree. But I've already found a way to implement a method into the next version of the product that'll keep LSV keywords in mind, so that they don't affect health of other keywords. My goal is to maximize performance, so if a large set of LSV will have an impact on other performing SKAGs, the tech will adjust accordingly to make sure nothing gets stolen from one SKAG to the next. Also using our tech, you *don't* have to head for very deep keywords (which are usually the cause of LSV). You can chose to go wide (I prefer both deep and wide, because why not..), but it'll be up to the user to decide how to make the best use of the tech.> the only way to serve on a random query like ""how much does it cost to paint my 2003 sebring bumper"" will probably be on BMM terms. Yup, we already serve it in BMM. See I've been tracking the change rate of LSV status in a local business, and it's going to be seasonal. It's obvious that due to the size of the market, a lot of the 875k SKAGs will never run in this specific local market. But what I did figure out was that since our building technology is capable of creating high-intent SKAGs with the use of relevant synonyms, it really builds a pool of SKAGs that I would've never built manually. Some of the combinations I see getting clicks/impressions, I just can't comprehend ever thinking of myself. And my theory is that ""people need to see the actual keyword searched in the ad to click"". So if the ad answers with relevance, they'll likely click it.> Behind the scenes, a lot of major companies are scrapping their 10+ million keyword accounts and running on leaner targeting.I can understand. But in our case there's a system of organization, nearly perfect relevance, an ability to learn from data and adjust -- and most importantly, and ability to carry the relevance post-click into the landing page. We've completely changed the idea as to how landing pages should be built. Can you imagine that 1 landing page serves all of the 875k SKAGs? (which holds different intents). I can understand how it can be hard to visualize this by the community, but the method is IMO truly unique.#Thank you! I haven't yet come across a platform that innovates the method to create intent-based ads. They're all great at managing them, but no one dared to say ""hey relevance has been maxed out using these current methods, let's tailor a whole new process to increase it"".The advantage we have with the current prototype is that we can actually assess computation costs. And since we have something to benchmark ourselves-with, we can analyze and improve the method as to how we'll go at parallelizing processes in order to make it insanely fast, and affordable to compute. The more affordable we can compute, the better priced we can be. What I've always disliked about these enterprise level platforms was: minimum spend requirements + costs. So I'll do my best to bring something affordable to the market. I think these enterprise level platforms will serve different markets than we will for a bit. We're currently aiming to help the small and medium sized SEM agencies / teams / experts for the moment, and eventually as we perfect the tech and how it should be used with teams, the platform will become more suited for enterprise level.#Thank you! You know you've got a good model as well. As long as you can provide quality/performance there's always a need for professionals like you. Keep up the quality work, I admire it :)#Thank you!#Hah I'm glad you read between the lines :) I've been asking questions to get some good ideas about things -- but I realized that one day or another I gotta speak out about the system as a whole in order to build the next level. You've all been super kind these last week since I started posting, so here we are.> Enterprise level software is a different game than individual account management. :)I totally agree, however the practices I hear from individual account management cases, are actually what'll make this product connect with more enterprise teams. The day to day management shouldn't change much, and I think there's a bigger market for smaller teams, than large scale applications (even though I'll try to implement both into the MVP).> Now I see why the SKAGS approach is necessary to account structure - It's a requirement for the software to function.Bingo. But in practice, it's actually the quickest and most efficient way to create high relevance between queries and intent.> What is the business model moving forward? Are you managing advertising clients purely to build, and sell the software? Or are you an advertising agency developing software?We're acting as a SaaS platform. Not an agency. We may act as an agency when testing the features, functionalities etc .. but long term goals are to provide a tool for other businesses to make use-of.> I think that's a key when it comes to some of the account structure, management, ownership/access, and reporting questions.Totally agree. And I think it's going to be the most difficult question for us to answer, because every segment of the advertising market would use this tech in a different way. Compare ecommerce to lead gen -- totally different animals. So I look forward to speaking to everyone about possible angles.#Thank you! Looking forward to chatting shortly!#I'm the closest to 1, and I don't have nearly as close to the years of experience in PPC as most of you do. I'd count myself as more of a visionary/innovator -- I question everything and do anything to prove myself right/wrong.I do however get the PPC game pretty well, and am looking forward to speaking with minds X10 brighter than mine in this space.#I'll add that not everyone thinks SKAGs are the best account structure.#I think I have to gain a certain amount of karma + have a 30 day old account before I can create the subreddit I want.

I don't think I'll leave the /r/ppc either since there's lots of good contributors that can share insights too.#Thank you! Looking forward to discussing with you :)#Thank you! I look forward to speaking with you as well.#Thank you! Looking forward to future discussions as I prepare the discussion environments/questions.#Thank you! Will be reaching out :)#Thank you!#>I'd be concerned about your CTO. Properly architecting the MVP should have negated the need for a rebuild.This CTO was recently brought in for a rebuild specifically. The first version was bootstrapped and built to prove an early concept. The next version is designed for SaaS. This current team is specifically designed to build the next product, not improve the past prototype. We're taking what we've learned, and building a new product out of it. You rarely build your first prototype perfectly. You actually usually go through multiple product iterations until you figure things out. Hopefully this clears things up.> Yeah, definitely concerned. With proper architecture, even in an MVP, this would not have been an issue.Not really, we just didn't consider the features in our first early prototype for reasons of focusing on validating the theory from A-Z. Now we're coming forward to address needs of the market to make it a SaaS product. You forgot to quote the second sentence ""(unless we implement granular management tools, which we'd love to :)"" -- which is why we're making sure that the features we'd like to chose align with the management desires of the market.#First, thanks for the comprehensive reply and again, I would love to test what you have and give you real world feedback. However...I still believe you are making many risky assumptions. You should probably map out every hypothesis you have and come up with an experiment that lets you test competing hypothesis against each other. > I think the web is a disasterOne of the most valuable lessons I learned about SEM was back in 2007, when we tested two versions of a clients landing page, one that looked super professional and one that looked about as scammy as can be...and watched the scammy one outperform 3-1 on conversions. The lesson here is not just to test different shapes and versions... the lesson is to understand that humans are deeply conditioned by the past, and if your landing page/website doesn't align with their expectations, you are not going to convert them (unless you bring extreme convenience.) This test was in an industry where people expected horrible websites. > Also, I'm doubtful that Google can predict your intent in all markets based on past searches, location etc. For example, if you want some rust repaired on your car right after winter, I highly doubt that it's a query that Google would have much data-for. It's a once every year type of event (if any).>This is a very risky assumption you are making. Just yesterday Google demonstrated how it can show three different ads based on intents to the keyword cheapest hotel based on different context of the user. Audience targeting is NOW, not later. Keywords are becoming less and less relevant (i.e. look at DSA, Shopping Campaigns, etc...) In-market for search is NOW. They have been predicting flu outbreaks for years, and no one believe ML can beat an expert GO player just two years ago. Don't underestimate what Google knows and can do...> Right so we're already have this built in its rawest form using a method that I would ""build"" hundreds of intents manually using our system.You haven't really explained what you mean by ""Intents"" Is this different types of queries, like informational, navigational and transactional? Is this different stages in the research and buying process (you mentioned funnel earlier) I would bet that context tells us 10x more than query about intent. This is really the only question I need to understand. How do you define intent and whats an example of two different intents and matched queries so we can get a feel for what you are accomplishing. Random Question: Do you think voice search, sensors, chatbots and messaging apps can fundamentally change discovery online? Do you really think dynamic landing pages will serve these new runtimes? Finally, Dynamic website content is already built in various marketing automation tools and some standalone tools. I am talking about using over 150 signals to dynamically structure the page for the visitor, keyword just being 1/150. This exists and there is a 6 figure hidden cost is setting up strategy for truly effective marketing automation. Your tools sounds like it can potentially make SEM 10x harder, not easier. Where will the return on investment be if we need to develop way more complex strategy, build out dynamic content blocks, etc... just to squeeze an extra 10%-20% efficiency out of what we have now. Again, I would love to better understand what you mean by ""INTENT"" and would love to test it on a live account as soon as possible...just to see what it does....#I'm working on an ecommerce project. Hit me with some details- these kind of setups get me wet. #The two hangups you're going to run into are that major companies often view dynamically generated ads/keywords as an operational/legal risk (hence why dynamic search ads are having trouble gaining traction) and a lot of major websites are at the size where they either can't or won't allow a random marketing company to dynamically generate LPs for them. That's not to say it CAN'T work, but I'd pay close attention to making sure that you have the right target audience in mind.#I dont have the answer you are looking for, but the Magic 8 Ball might! *shakes the 8 ball and slowly turns it over to reveal the answer* **Are you trying to [confuse](/r/confuse) me?**#This would be my major concern - don't get me wrong, your idea sounds great and it's a major plus that you're reaching out to the community to get their feedback. But without someone who has been in this space for 7+ years, you won't get the full picture - I've been doing this for 4.5 years and done well, but still run into things that are completely different from anything I've previously seen.#I understand. Feel free to share insights on your thoughts re: positives/negatives.#""The first version was bootstrapped and built to prove an early concept""Yeah, no shit.""You actually usually go through multiple product iterations until you figure things out. Hopefully this clears things up.""Proper design means that you actually iterate, not rebuild after you move from MVP to v1. Actually ideally you should be able to get to product market fit on the MVP.""Not really, we just didn't consider the features in our first early prototype""Of course not, thats not the issue. But unless you are suddenly and unexpectedly at twitter/google scale, basic design principles should give you plenty of headroom to handle reasonably large (sub 2TB~) sets of data, especially in AWS or GCC.Look, maybe this isn't your first rodeo and you know exactly what you are doing. However in my experience building platforms in adtech, if you are talking rebuild after MVP or are talking about data scale issues before you are even scaling a v1 then something went wrong and you should get some outside technical opinions from engineers who have gone from 0 to 1. I would not rely on the technical expertise of individuals who's backgrounds are primarily within established teams and architectures.But hey, its your company.#Hey thanks for the care and attention as well. Loving these back to back conversations.> I still believe you are making many risky assumptions. You should probably map out every hypothesis you have and come up with an experiment that lets you test competing hypothesis against each other.Agreed, it's what I'm doing with many of the case studies I'm building. I'm hoping that the MVP once built can give SEM experts the tools to test and give feedback as well to expedite the process.> One of the most valuable lessons I learned about SEM was back in 2007, when we tested two versions of a clients landing page, one that looked super professional and one that looked about as scammy as can be...and watched the scammy one outperform 3-1 on conversions.The lesson here is not just to test different shapes and versions... the lesson is to understand that humans are deeply conditioned by the past, and if your landing page/website doesn't align with their expectations, you are not going to convert them (unless you bring extreme convenience.) This test was in an industry where people expected horrible websites.I understand what you mean with my rash statement of ""the web is a disaster"". I think my comment may have been misperceived. I've also seen cases where scammy looking websites outperformed beautiful-looking ones. What I was referring to was that there's a marginal amount of everyday website designers/developers that know how to keep marketing in mind when building out sites for clients. So they pump out pages with low quality content, designs and structures which serve very little to SEO, SEM and Social Marketing. And I feel like a large share of the web is just flooded with low quality, low relevance content that Google now has to crawl, clean, organize and rank. I just don't buy the fact that they can work with bad content.> This is a very risky assumption you are making. Just yesterday Google demonstrated how it can show three different ads based on intents to the keyword cheapest hotel based on different context of the user. Audience targeting is NOW, not later. Keywords are becoming less and less relevant (i.e. look at DSA, Shopping Campaigns, etc...) In-market for search is NOW. They have been predicting flu outbreaks for years, and no one believe ML can beat an expert GO player just two years ago. Don't underestimate what Google knows and can do...You're right to point out that I'm making risky assumptions. And I look forward to be proven wrong, whatever makes the web better :) I like how you're addressing the need for audience targeting right now, and I'll evaluate how it fits into the context of the product we're building. Someone recently suggested to me, to use audiences into the mix to better target a user [when dealing with double-intent keywords](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/6c9r41/how_do_you_deal_with_doubleintents/dhx6udb/).> You haven't really explained what you mean by ""Intents"" Is this different types of queries, like informational, navigational and transactional? Is this different stages in the research and buying process (you mentioned funnel earlier) I would bet that context tells us 10x more than query about intent.This is really the only question I need to understand. How do you define intent and whats an example of two different intents and matched queries so we can get a feel for what you are accomplishing.Sure, and I agree that without seeing the first prototype visually, this is all very difficult to grasp. So my apologies for that.So an intent is defined by the types of keywords included within it which tell you what the user is trying to achieve. Since we're using BMM, order doesn't matter. Take these keywords for example:1) schedule car body repair appointment = belongs to the intent looking for schedule/appointment/car body repair.2) car body repair appointment = belongs to the intent looking for schedule/appointment/car body repair.3) car body repair = belongs to the intent looking for car body repair.4) car repair = car repairKeyword from intent #1: I assume tells me the user is looking to take an appointment for a car body repair shop.Keyword from intent #2: I assume tells me the user is looking to take an appointment for a car body repair shop.Keyword from intent #3: I assume tells me the user is looking for a car body repair, or not since a variety of keywords can be queried alongside it. Negative management will be required for this intent group that'll make up maybe 1,000 keywords just like the keyword stemming from intent #3.Keyword from intent #4: I assume tells me the user is looking for a car repair, or not since a variety of keywords can be queried alongside it. But in this case it's not body repair, because if it was, keyword from intent #3 would've been triggered. So the more intents the system can build, the more it can tell Google/Bing which SKAG to trigger. We also support the ability to block out keywords as negatives from intents, and I'm hoping we can build some service to automatically identify potential negative keywords that should be assigned to the intent (so combination of SKAGs generated) so that they don't trigger on irrelevant queries. It really will depend how the user will want to use the tech: be strict and aim for performance, or be lean and learn while having the benefit of still being relevant with ads.I gave you examples for 4 intents with each 1 keyword within them. Our prototype does this on a mass scale into millions, while building SKAGs including intent-relevant ads that the user predefined. Let me know if this clarifies things a little. Once again, hard to visualize here, but once you guys see the builder and process, you'll all connect to it automatically.> Finally, Dynamic website content is already built in various marketing automation tools and some standalone tools. I am talking about using over 150 signals to dynamically structure the page for the visitor, keyword just being 1/150. This exists and there is a 6 figure hidden cost is setting up strategy for truly effective marketing automation.The bulk of our innovation is in the process of building intent-relevant ads. If there's tools out there which do a great job at landing page management, where we can tap our product into the mix, then great. Our goal is to make 1 stage of the account/campaign building process better so that it can elevate the following stages (landing page relevance). Preliminary few tests have shown that intent-focused landing pages can hit ROI if properly used. I agree that additional signals can be added into the mix, and I'm not disregarding them. We simply haven't gotten to that point yet -- we're really focused on perfecting the intent-builder side of things before getting more creative with additional targeting options.> Your tools sounds like it can potentially make SEM 10x harder, not easier.If we don't execute our dynamic landing page builder based on intents in the right way, I totally agree it'll that it can be difficult. And I'm trying to avoid this by identifying which tools/tech experts currently use to build landing pages, so that I could evaluate how we can fit our process into the mix, and make it fairly easy to use. I don't want to build a brand new landing page tool, but if the market of current tools can't serve what our process and method will require, then we may have to while opening up an API to allow integrations into custom setups for the more advanced/custom marketing goals. But rest assured that the current method isn't very difficult. With the right UI and rules, it's a simple process given that the user organizes his intents properly.> Where will the return on investment be if we need to develop way more complex strategy, build out dynamic content blocks, etc... just to squeeze an extra 10%-20% efficiency out of what we have now.I don't have the metrics yet to tell you how much performance increased-by. In my current test, one landing page is currently ready to serve perfectly all 875k SKAG's intents. I think the magic of the technology is the ability to carry over the relevance from the original search query. One landing page I tested with was able to change its colors from pink to blue because the intent referred was for a boy vs. girl. Another case I created was able to dynamically adjust the page to showcase directions more than features of the car repair business, because the intent referred was relating to ""nearest"". There's something special about it when you see it in action, and the effort required to build out the strategy pays off when you set the rules properly. I look forward to being able to address your question in more detail as we gather more data on performance.Hopefully this answers some of your questions, feel free to ask more :)#Hey thanks for your interest. We're not ready for public use yet, but the MVP will be. Would you like to get included in the upcoming private subreddit to follow our progress? Cheers!#Very good to know. Thank you.Have you read anything recent in relation to this that you could maybe link me to?> a lot of major websites are at the size where they either can't or won't allow a random marketing company to dynamically generate LPs for them.It's partially dynamically generated. The bulk of the content it user created, but things are just slightly tweaked with the intention referred. You might see various strings of the keyword appear through various places on the landing pages, you might see a more prioritized piece of content versus another, or you may see different call to actions. I mean it's limitless in possibilities, but it's not fully decided by some AI. What our tech does it really elevate what matters the most based on the intent referred -- and the SEM expert has the choice to pick what matters the most based on his beliefs.> but I'd pay close attention to making sure that you have the right target audience in mind.As far as referring the right target audience, it'll be all up to the SEM expert to decide which intents to focus on, and how to control negatives to those intent-groups. We plan on building out tools that'll help them make decisions, but once again it'll be up to the strategist to control his account.#My bad. I agree that the reply was really skewed for /u/tomhalejr (he understands what I mean based on the back to back conversations we've had this last week through various posts).#I agree, and I think it'll simply come down to learning bit by bit what the SEM expert market wants next after each release.What I'm doing while building this product, is also testing the current prototype in various markets with either some offers, or clients I've had relationships-with. Every test shows me something new about the tech. I may bring in some PPC talent in the near future to begin analyzing the data/performance while I run these tests -- which'll help us adjust the tech bit by bit.This upcoming MVP will be purely focused on perfecting our new proposed method while answering some of the core needs i.e. organization of SKAGs, budget allocation etc. As I re-architect things with the CTO, I'm being very strict on practices and architectures so that we can add-in services and features without messing with monolithic code.#Advice doesn't have to be condescending. Wow, what ivory tower do you join us from?#> Yeah, no shit.No reason to be rude here. I'm simply addressing remarks. Let's stay professional.> Proper design means that you actually iterate, not rebuild after you move from MVP to v1. Actually ideally you should be able to get to product market fit on the MVP.Actually, no. Every business has different goals. In our case, we wanted to prove the theory before we commit to spending money on proper implementations / practices. So some work came around free, some didn't. But hey, it allowed us to build and prove a theory from A-Z. And the current product, although not written with the best practices was never designed to be brought to SaaS. It was designed to say ""yes or no, this product will/will not improve relevance"". Why commit to something, when you don't even know if it works? Better to prove it first, and then takeaway the goods, learn from the bads and rewrite from there. I can't even tell you how many things we've learned from this current prototype -- and things we wouldn't of had learned otherwise. Agility, and budget played a huge role in building this first prototype. We built confidence which attracted new more advanced talent. Sorry, but unless you've built products with little funding in the past, I'll argue otherwise.> Of course not, thats not the issue. But unless you are suddenly and unexpectedly at twitter/google scale, basic design principles should give you plenty of headroom to handle reasonably large (sub 2TB~) sets of data, especially in AWS or GCC.It's ok, it's all going to be addressed in this rewrite that'll be tailored for usability/scalability. I don't understand your frustration here, you can't really think that you really have the magic formula to build all startups? Every case is different.> Look, maybe this isn't your first rodeo and you know exactly what you are doing. However in my experience building platforms in adtech, if you are talking rebuild after MVP or are talking about data scale issues before you are even scaling a v1 then something went wrong and you should get some outside technical opinions from engineers who have gone from 0 to 1. I would not rely on the technical expertise of individuals who's backgrounds are primarily within established teams and architectures.Actually we're not doing a rebuild after an MVP. We're doing a first MVP now. The first version was a prototype designed to prove a theory. It didn't have users, monetization, usability in mind. It was pretty much an interface to input data in a specific way which would allow us to compute the desired output. By using our prototype in its rawest form, we were able to observe patterns and learn new usability features for the next version. I guarantee that it's impossible to build what we've built without having gone through the steps we've taken. Of course once/if you see it, it may look obvious. But you build a team that'll back you from day 1 with finances and money with 0 evidence of the theory being proven...#I'm so not a software guy, but I appreciate the fact you are really trying to get feedback from the community (your potential customer base) as part of the development process. That really does make me feel good about the conversation. :)From my limited perspective, If I had a seat at the table, these are some of the questions I would want answered, to lead the conversation through the MVP stage:Who is the target market?What is the UVP of the product?How do we ""sell"" this thing? :)#Omg, he signaled a number of red-flags that would raise serious questions about the engineering chops of his team to most experienced VCs and founders. My original post was not condescending, it merely called those out. Look at his reply:""You actually usually go through multiple product iterations until you figure things out. Hopefully this clears things up.""THATS condescending.  The reality is that the way he describes his ""data lake"", the approach he is taking to product development (as he describes it), and the switch to a rebuild post MVP indicates some fundamental flaws in execution. However he wasn't really into exploring those and how to adjust, he just dismissed the concerns and explained why he was right.The thing is, if he replies like that to VCs and doesn't own the feedback, he won't get a second meeting. My follow up was actually a VERY gentle attempt to indicate to (what appears to be) a first time founder that he better get some more seasoned input on startup engineering before he is irrevocably fucked. Unfortunately, he will likely need to go through the same learning curve as the rest of us (myself included) and enjoy a series of dead-ends before he learns how to humble his ego and detect fail conditions.If you think any of that was condescending, you haven't ever pitched or raised money.#No I don't have a magic formula. However I do have some known red flags based on my experience starting and investing in companies, both in and out of ad tech.But hey, there are always outliers and your mileage may vary. Best of luck.#Hey thanks! That means a lot to me -- you know I've been keeping this product away from everyone for a while because I've been wanting to just get 1 step closer to getting preliminary data from real cases. Once I saw the first figures, I knew that the community may get a kick out of things.To answer your preliminary questions:* Target market = SEM marketers, SEM agencies -- Ideally if we move towards writing our own landing page tech, things can become easy enough for anyone to build targeted content/pages/websites with marketing in mind. I found that the web lacked understanding of marketing. Every other developer/designer knew how to put pages together, but didn't know how to include them within distribution channels. This tech marries the process of marketing + dev + design into 1 set of rules, which if done properly can drive results. I want to start with SEM market because you're the ones that get it. I'm on the fence about PLA / ecommerce, because it affects certain features. I think I'd rather first focus on refining the tech with the right minds, and eventually transition to more db-oriented audiences.* Biggest UVP = Allows you to test SKAGs or groups on intent-levels, while also being relevant and hit CTR's/CVR's. That's for the current version of the product which isn't yet user-friendly. This next version/MVP will be purely focused on usability + speed + answering needs of the market. At that point, if you've refined a whole new way to create account/campaign structures, you've then reduced creation process times, replaced tools like excel, and elevated the SEM expert to focus on optimizations. I'm trying to shortcut the process of creation, and that's only possible if you completely re-engineer the way campaigns ought to be created.* Sales = Having a good group of early adopters will be useful. I've also got some contacts to fortune 500 CEO's which some have already expressed interest in the tech. Sometimes in business it just takes 1 lucky break for you to get highlighted to the right people. So I want to focus on perfecting the tech, while being agile in the development cycle. I think that once it's proven to work, I can begin to propose case studies to more businesses (and since it'll be SaaS, SEM experts will be able to adapt it into their workflows as well). I have an idea for monetization, but I haven't done the research yet to see if it makes sense yet. I have a few people in mind that I can hire to do a good analysis, but benchmarks will be required first. So the more efficient my CTO and I are on the next stack/infrastructure, the lower computation costs can get and the more affordable we can make it.#> THATS condescending.I'd argue otherwise. I was just clearing up the misperception that you may have created from my OP.> The reality is that the way he describes his ""data lake"", the approach he is taking to product development (as he describes it), and the switch to a rebuild post MVP indicates some fundamental flaws in execution. Actually a data lake is just a method to store the data in its rawest form. What I also meant with that was to say that our tool is designed for mass manipulation of data -- but sometimes users want that granularity (filtering etc), so we're going to be turning to the community to identify which added tools they'll need based on the format of the big data the platform can compute. I also keep on iterating that this first product was not an MVP. It was an early prototype to prove a concept. No matter how many times I'll say it, you'll argue otherwise. So fine, pretend like you know our internal objectives. You must know better.> The thing is, if he replies like that to VCs and doesn't own the feedback, he won't get a second meeting.I haven't yet addressed VC's, you're once again jumping to conclusions with your own vision for where we should head with this product.> (what appears to be) a first time founder that he better get some more seasoned input on startup engineering before he is irrevocably fuckedI don't get what you're arguing about. We're rewriting our tech from A-Z because our first focus was to not waste time on practices and implementations, but rather prove a full-cycle prototype. Now we can play and learn all we want from it while building the real MVP.> Unfortunately, he will likely need to go through the same learning curve as the rest of us (myself included) and enjoy a series of dead-ends before he learns how to humble his ego and detect fail conditions.You're the one with the ego. Look at the tone you've addressed my kind remarks from the get-go. You've had anger built up in you from the start. I haven't even considered firing back at you based on the arrogant tone you've expressed from the beginning. I rather focus on people who can share insights, rather than pick arguments that'll lead to nowhere.> If you think any of that was condescending, you haven't ever pitched or raised money.No, and it's not our goal at this stage.#Rebuilding a product with no validation is a huge red flag.Rebuilding a product with a proven theory, ability to learn patterns for usability and get insights from in-market performance of the output without having to involve customers yet... huge privilege.My team admires the fact that I've put in the mileage and sweat to validate things before they even have to lift a finger.By adding in SEM experts into the mix now, we can refine our MVP candidate features list so that the MVP built will boast proven performance while answering to direct needs, with a new infrastructure designed to scale from 0 to 1 quickly enough if things catch on.Thanks for the wishes.#""I'm on the fence about PLA / ecommerce, because it affects certain features.""Actually, I think that may be the better direction to go in. You eliminate a lot of the variables. The market is changing and KW's are becoming less necessary. Account structure is less of a concern with shopping campaigns. The front end / back end setup could really benefit from automation. There's more front end labor costs without automation, making the sales pitch/value more appealing.I had a conversation with Sr. about this today. It reinforced to us our UVP, and why we can do things as a small family business that others can't. We can operate more efficiently, we have lower costs, so we can take on more smaller clients, and develop structures that work for them. However, one of our biggest challenges and obstacles are shopping campaigns. :) I can build out the feed manually, but only if I have all the information I need. There is some information I can only get from the client, because their ecommerce platform doesn't provide it. If you can develop a product that integrates with some of the most popular ecommerce engines, I could definitely see value there. But, that's not the current business plan, so... :)""At that point, if you've refined a whole new way to create account/campaign structures, you've then reduced creation process times, replaced tools like excel, and elevated the SEM expert to focus on optimizations.""That could work as a sales pitch for SMB agencies. It will require you to ""sell"" them on the process, but you seem like the right person for the job. :) The plan/approval/deliverable process is crucial - That's how agencies sell the advertising. Agencies may also be more likely to ""own"" the account, perhaps only providing read/report level access to their clients (not our way of doing things, but...). That solves a lot of the account structure issues - As long as you have integrated reporting features.I think you definitely need to have an SEM person on your team eventually.

I think building for SMB will allow us to tailor many of the features we need to build first, and then we can look into branching towards larger markets like ecommerce platforms which will require a certain level of automation.

I'd have to speak to the devs about this, but an override feature should solve this, and which/how many data points it would have to compare in order to detect discrepancies.> Honestly captain, I think I've reached the end of any usefulness I can be to you. :) I'm not technically skilled enough to really help with the software development, and I don't see myself being a customer.>I am more than willing to help you in any way I can in regards to questions relating to specific AdWords policies, tools, tactics, or definitions in those threads. But, it's time I respectfully remove myself from the software development conversation. :) You take the time to respond to everyone, and at this point, your time is better spent responding to those who can actually help you develop this thing further. :)I think you're more helpful thank you think you are :) When I posted this thread to the community, I wasn't looking for anyone to help me correlate ideas/thoughts with software dev. But rather do what we're doing right now. Bounce thoughts based on the knowns/unknowns, and speak in the context of ""Ok, if I as an SEM expert/agency was to use such tech, I would need X, Y, Z  in order to make sure that it covers the needs of the markets I serve"".I think many are misperceiving me as a non-SEM guy, but I've got a good grasp of the field - more than you guys think. As I comb thought all (and I mean all) AdWords/Bing features, I relate them to the tech we've built, and see where/how they can be applied. We can't build them all from the get-go, so it's why I'm coming to the community to get a feel for ""what's needed now"" vs. ""what can be done later"".Thank you for your help, I hope to still hear from you as I pose SEM-related questions in the coming days/weeks.

I wouldn't be surprised if there was a huge curve since many of the questions were poorly written or too long for a Pro-equivalent exam.#Passed the advanced networking.  Waiting on the security results still.  So glad I don't have to go through that exam again for another year and a half for recert.#Yeah just got  my big data pass!!Edit: looks like i really scraped it at 65% pass. I let competency in all but 2 areas.I suppose to be fair i was only a csa assoc when i took the exam, hopefully would have done better now i have 4 of 5 under my belt.#I only took big data and... I passed!

I mean...Magna Carta as an answer...come on man. I think there were some other comical placeholders (can't remember any more from re:invent) and even a few didn't even have 4 choices.#Same thing for me with Big Data#That can only mean advanced networking is the toughest. Unless, you and the others use alot of the big data tools regularly and thus, found it easier#At the very top in a box it should say if you got the email#I just noticed that on my AWS certifications transcript it lists my big data specialty as expiring on May 30, 2019.

Maybe yours has updated, too.#I've heard networking was stupidly hard but havent done it or security.I am part of the big data practise, but I wouldnt say I use a lot of the AWS big data tools on a regular basis. I've never used Kinesis, I've used DynamoDB in one practise lab only and never otherwise, the only one I do use regularly is EMR and occassionally redshift in a dev environment only. So all in all not that much relevant to the exam#Haven't gotten an email, will keep an eye out#Good shout!#I didn't think it was too difficult (It was _long_ tho, I finished with less than 2 minutes to spare), and passed with an 84, but I was a network engineer in another life so things like BGP and 802.1q and such are second nature for me (Lots of direct connect questions). I could see it being harder for someone coming from the sysadmin direction.#Cool. Let me know. I got 65%, and passed, so just wondering if we can put some evidence behind your theory of a huge curve!#I didnt even bother learning BGP for my CSA-Pro. And it came up like 3 times. Haha.Probably should have.#IMO - Adv Networking was far harder than big data.Security is a wildcard - seemed so random in its focus.#I strongly suspect I wont ever do networking. Security is a distant, but still possible, option as I think it is vital for consultants to be able to demonstrate to new clients how the cloud is every bit as secure (potentially) as their on prem data center (or more so). Networking is just so far outside of my usual skill depth that it'd probably detract frmo other parts of my career to focus on

datascience;6g4usu;1496966358.0;/r/datascience/comments/6g4usu/how_many_companies_actually_have_big_data/;How many companies actually have 'big data'?;Big data has been a huge buzzword (uh, term) for quite a number of years now.  How many companies actually have 'big data', though?  I recently attended a data science bootcamp with people from companies around the country, and while nearly everyone thought that they worked with 'big data', the company that I work for was the only one with data that even surpassed a few million rows (and even I only use Teradata -- the Hadoop environment is only for people with highly specialized skills).  The instructors claimed that there are only a handful of companies out there that truly have 'big data' problems, in that they work daily with so much data that distributed systems are absolutely necessary.  To what degree do you agree or disagree?;"Volume, velocity, variety (and sometimes validity/veracity) are the 3 (4) V's conventionally used to define ""big data"". Volume is easy to have, as is variety. Not that many places have the velocity part, though it depends on how the data is used in many cases. While I wouldn't say it's only a handful, I do agree that most data heavy companies don't do all that much of the 3 Vs of big data simultaneously. #[deleted]#Only going to speak generally since the other posts covered more specific definitions. I am always skeptical of the people I know who say they work with ""big data"" but are running processing locally on a laptop. In my field, even a 16 node cluster will get bottlenecked easily. At my last job, we had a 400 node cluster and petabytes of storage that was backed up daily#I found that a lot of people who say ""big data"" can still run a handful of mysql tables on a single machine. Hell, my first DS job was with a company whose entire dataset fit comfortably in memory so I could around with it in Python.More and more though, companies do have datasets the require Hadoop etc. Logging has just gotten easier, storage cheaper, and the tools to query​ faster.#[deleted]#I work for one of the core vendors in this space, from what I see the main problem in your question is that the definition of big data keeps getting bigger.The biggest data by volume at the moment is machine data, usually measured in low 100's of TBs per day, but easily going into petabytes per day. This still runs into the problem of what is economically storable. Think Oil rig sensors, or all the network monitoring data at a small telco.Big data can also be difficult data, for example some parts of the insurance industry only deals in low TBs per day but it's all very messy XML that needs to be shredded and analysed a hundred ways very quickly.Velocity is a problem when you have billions of tiny messages that need to be analysed against other data to do things like detect fraud in banking transactions within a few hundred milliseconds - it's not by volume, but the geographic distribution of the inbound messages and the window for response puts it in a sister category.So, perhaps it would be more useful to say that 'Big Data' is any data processing problem that doesn't fit in a single databases server  or laptop - what makes it bigger than those stalwarts is not always the same however.#I'd imagine that pretty much any large company/corporation, especially older ones, has at least 10s/100s of gigabytes if not terabytes worth of data.  If they have any efforts in an area like imagery, this can be vastly more.That said, how much of that data is accessible or intended for any use beyond record keeping may be far less.  Their use cases will determine the systems/databases they need, and usually those systems aren't really ""big data"".We have particular apps, tools, and analytics pipelines that do require pulling and processing data at scale, and in those cases we do use things like Hadoop, Spark, Cassandra, etc.#In the Enterprise Industrial IoT space, it's quite easy even for a simple PoC to get beyond a few million rows of data when you have sensors & gateway devices publishing frequently.  We've worked with several companies who have thousands of devices in the field reporting data back, but it's more likely that they're just getting started.  So, in our space I guess I'd say about 20 or 30% of companies I've seen already have what might be termed ""big data"" problems.. while the others aren't more than a few years behind and want to avoid issues as they roll out their solutions.There are many things we've done with our IoT data management platform (http://brightwolf.com/platform/) to deal with the unique challenge of IoT data and it's use in applications, reports, ML models, etc...  but honestly I cringe at the improper use of 'big data' for IoT and those who Hadooop-up unnecessarily.#A lot of them have big data, but very few have questions you can answer with big data.For example, I worked at a company with billion-row Redshift database.  I did a study where I looked at accuracy rates for record matching between peoples' names and phone numbers.  I couldn't use the billion rows because the only way to determine if a record was created accurately is to actually call the number and ask (or use voicemail) to figure it out.Millions of rows but 30000 phone calls.  It became a ""small data"" problem.Similarly, I was working on a team with a new product.  Over time it'll probably become big data, but when I left it was only about 500,000 rows because we didn't have that many subscribers.#I'd say very few companies have access to big data sets (100s of billions of rows) for practical use out side of Google, SAP, etc.#Maybe I don't understand something, but how can ""velocity"" define a data? Velocity is a perfomance of processing data, but not the term to define a data itself. Am I wrong?#[deleted]#You don't need a PhD to be a data scientist, in fact a lot of the PhDs Ive worked with have made poor data scientists because their solutions are too academic and aren't practically applicable. Data Scientists come in a bunch of different types, so don't discount yourself because you didn't get a PhD#What were you using a 400 node cluster for? (Industry/Vertical if you don't want to get too specific)#I'd say most companies have millions of rows of data, but I wouldn't call that big data. #More like petabytes#Except all of it is virtually inaccessible. #[deleted]#Some who refer to big data projects are talking about dealing with a static offline data set.  I see velocity to define the rate at which new data is arriving that must be processed before it is useful.  So, you're correct that velocity is partially determined by the performance of processing the data, but that's not all...  I guess I'd say the processing performance determines the latency along with communication latencies.. but the rate at which the data is produced determines the velocity.Ex, with IoT sensor data being collected every 10ms and millions of sensors there is a much higher velocity of data being generated than a database receiving 100 orders per day.  If they're processed later in a 30day batch report, the IoT sensor scenario still has a higher velocity.. but they both have the same latency.#Velocity can mean how fast it is processed and how fast it is acquired in the first place. But my main point is, say, even if some central server at McDonald's acquired all orders at once in continuous time, the company probably wouldn't need to do much with that data immediately. The ""real time analysis"" of streaming data is a less often encountered part of big data. Hence few (in relative terms) companies actually deal with that. I work at a company where we'll get dozens of Gb of data in an hour, but that's the raw stuff. What gets to me much later is dozens of Mb, from which I get insights that will eventually turn into some real time analysis features. So, while my company does deal with big data, in the 3V sense, a lot of the work does not.#As the others have said, the velocity of data is generally considered the rate at which new data is coming in, so it is not really about any single datum, but rather the data set as a whole.A common example of the velocity of data is Twitter (and more broadly data stream mining). The speed at which new tweets are created makes doing almost anything with it impossible. Certainly no super-linear algorithms ( O(nlog(n)) or anything like that) is able to keep up, and often even sub-linear algorithms in O(log(n)) are often necessary if you want to have any live analyses. A lot of pretty standard approaches just no longer work, and break when you have that. Even counting things can be challenging.So when Velocity is used to define big data, it is this axis of a *data set* (rather than the individual datums themselves) that is generally being considered. If we take the Big Data stance of ""it's the data that makes everything break"", then when you have a data set increasing in size so fast that they had to change their entire database infrastructure just to manage ID creation (https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2010/announcing-snowflake.html), you start to get an idea of why Velocity is added to the 3V's of Big Data#I blame recruiters somewhat for this. As Data Scientist is a high demand field but also a fairly new term it's hard to find people with experience as a data scientist, because they were probably called something else before. So the recruiter searches for people with PhD in a scientific field because they tend to have all the core requisites and are easy to find.  Next thing you know all of the data scientists people have worked with have had PhDs so that starts to define what a DS is.#computational anatomy, primarily with biomedical imaging data (MRI, CT, all kinds), but others also did things with genetics data#Agreed I think your parent comment fell into the classic trap of thinking their data is bigger than it is. If your entire corpus fits in memory it's not big data. #I know, but depending on what technologies you're using, you can process different amount of data in different time. For example person A with technologies used X can process 100 Gb of data for 1 second, while person B using technologies named Y can process 1 Tb of data for the same 1 second. So velocity itself can't define, how big the data is. Or am I wrong with the definition of velocity?#FWIW, this may be partially driven out of other data intensive AND interdisciplinary fields such as chem/bio informatics. In these fields, having a handle on all the necessary sub-disciplines requires long years of study and enough experience playing with data and programming to be competent enough to handle a dataset in some areas where results are taken very seriously.#I think velocity, volume, etc are intended as metrics that define the practical limits of traditional/single machine approaches to storing, retrieving and analyzing data.So a data stream with a velocity of 100gb/sec would probably pose difficulty storing data using conventional tools. Thus it is ""big"". Big in big data just means it can't be handled with conventional tools, its not necessarily a measure of size. Velocity isnt a measure of data's size, but it is a measurement that may qualify a data pipeline as ""big""."

May as well replace the whole thing with a google ""site:xyz.com"" query. #Agreed to some extent, but that also assumes that Google and Common Crawl find the same things. Not only that, but any Google dorking isn't going to provide the statistical guarantees referenced in the write-up.As stated in the caveats, I'd say this data is best used alongside a list like the one provided by dirs3arch, so you not only get the content discovery powers associated with their ""unlinked"" hit lists but also the statistical guarantee of coverage based on observations within the Common Crawl dataset."
chemistry;6ggaqw;1497114186.0;/r/chemistry/comments/6ggaqw/python_vs_matlab_vs_maple/;Python vs MATLAB vs Maple;I'm an undergrad doing organic chem work and my teacher told me it is very important to learn about multivariable analysis, big data manipulation, manipulation of spectra (second derivatives, vector normalization, whatever that helps)... I'm wondering if any other chemist around (doesn't have to be an organic) uses one of those tools mentioned in the title and what for. In your experience, which one has the most applications in chemistry? Thank you in advance;"Python#Python. Matlab isn't free and you don't want to get really good at something just to not be able to use it when the license expires. Python is free and has easily the best libraries and functionality. Can't say I've ever used maple, but python can do everything maple can do and is free. I believe maple is really good for high performance, but if you need that then you should learn fortran or c++, which are much faster and better (and free). I do all my data analysis in python and I am able to process days worth of data in seconds#Don't know about chemistry specificaly but here are a few things to considere.Matlab and Maple are both proprietary. It means the source code is closed and you have to pay for it. Python on the other hand is a general purpose language that is open source and free, has a very large community (meaning you can find help easily if you have problems) and is used a lot by data scientists.I would recommend Python just for the open source part.#[deleted]#So on my end, both. You can make  GORGEOUS figures with python. everyone in my lab uses MATLAB for stuff like image analysis though #In chemometrics, which is a branch of analytical chemistry dealing with experimental design and statistical calibrations, MATLAB and R are popular. Python can be used off-the-shelf to do most things in this domain (and beyond, in other non-chemistry related tasks), but cutting edge packages for chemometrics are often released in MATLAB and R.In chemoinformatics and molecular modeling, Python is generally considered to be king though some presence by MATLAB and R can be seen.#Python or R. I'm a material scientist and I use Python a ton and it is also a general programming language. I've started learning R because it has better stats and visualizations but python will still be my workhorse language. #MATLAB is easy and powerful as hell#With the examples you mentioned, MVDA for the manipulation of spectra and big data sets then I'd definitely suggest R, it's what I use daily to carry out these tasks. If you want to learn python alongside R it wouldn't hurt. I have numerous examples of using python for bespoke instrument control, and passing data to R for analysis and realtime display. I recently developed a chemometrics course using R that was delivered to the Pharmaceutical​ industry, if you want to DM me I can share some of the content. #For actual data analysis, I recommend Python unless it's the type of number crunching that necessitates C or FORTRAN.  Even then, it's still fairly robust if you use the right packages.  It's also free, which is a big plus.  For making graphs, I recommend MATLAB based on my own experience.  It's pretty straightforward to make appealing graphics with only a little practice.  I can't say whether the same is true for Python, since I haven't learned how to make graphs in Python.#I'm with u/Chemist8751 in that your teacher is overestimating the importance of all of those things, especially with regards to organic chemistry (physical, computational, and analytical chemists are more in need of those tools/skills).I use python almost exclusively  but I understand the power of Matlab. Another programmer in my lab uses almost exclusively Matlab. You *can* do everything in one that you can do in another. Python is better for general purpose stuff (I had to write a program that automated clicks on my computer to manually extract data from an out-of-data program that would have taken me weeks without python). Matlab is a little bit better for graphically-driven exploratory data analysis (I use the peak-fit tool and plotting functions for some quick stuff) and is a bit easier to get up and running with some specialized stuff (machine learning).I'd say that if you want to publish your code, it can be useful to do it in Python, as it's more freely avaliable. If you're just doing data analysis for yourself, Matlab is fine and you shouldn't have too big a learning curve transitioning to python/numpy/matplotlib.If you're going to use Python, I'd recommend installing Anaconda as it manages a lot of relevant packages and generally makes everything easier.Edit: A lot of people are talking about making graphs/charts: I'd highly advise learning how to export to .svg and then using a vector graphics editor (Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape) to tailor your graph to exactly what you want.#I think Maple is used for algebra and symbolic manipulations.  A free package that can do similar is Maxima:http://maxima.sourceforge.net/#[deleted]#If for no other reason than: it does what the others do, but it's also a general purpose language. So your skills are transferable.#[deleted]#[deleted]#Yeah most chemists dont use advanced software but if you specialize in water or industry production matlab is really nice.#graphing quality :MATLAB < MAPLE < MATHEMATICA < PYTHON#> I don't know a single chemist who would work as ""chemist"" (doing experiments/measurements) and who would waste time to prepare own scritps or programs.I know quite a few of those, but most of the time for other things than data manipulation. Our colleagues from the analytics department are building their own spectrometers and microscopes and write their own software. Another group is building micro-flow reactors and do simulations where they have quite a lot of programming involved. The (bio)imaging group is simulating diffusion with their own scripts and even in our group (synthetic chemistry) we have written our own scripts to extract for example NMR or IR data or do simple simulations of our homemade flow-photoreactor.What I want to say is that beeing able to write simple scripts can help a lot and make your life easier in basically every field of chemistry, so learning something like python is defnitely no mistake.#And a lot of chemistry software has some kind of python interface (TopSpin, NWChem,....) while I've never heard of a matlab interface.#Really depends on the type of chemistry you want to do: cheminformatics, molecular dynamics, quantum, etc. all have different ecosystems#Once you're familiar with the language, you can look up the documentation for whatever packages you want to use. NumPy and SciPy could be useful, and there are chem specific packages too that you could search for. #Octave is pretty compatible with MATLAB once you load all the addins and get subfunctions figured out (the designer hates nested functions for some reason.) I got my old college MATLAB chemical reactor sims to run in Octave once I got that sorted out. #Yeah, python is sort of the ultimate glue language these days. #And rdkit, openbabel"

Why now let big data make our plans for us and solve our problems for us, allocate priorities and directives according to online referendums and AI algorithms, etc. Because they'd tell us all to be communists?;[deleted];"Rule by democracy simply does not work out in the long run due to the tendency towards socialism. Watch the Atlas Shrugged movies. Look up Austrian economic theory on YouTube. A good book explaining this is Friedrich Hayek's ""The Road to Serfdom"". On an interesting note, leaving out democracy, I think an AI guided system that simply tries to achieve the best possible outcome for society based on data would not lead to communism. The best system ever devised for improving the general outcome of society is capitalism, libertarianism and economic freedom (1). You want very low taxes, few regulations and a very small government/AI. A big government is unbelievably inefficient and slows economic prosperity of everyone as a whole (3). It is clear that America was better at technological innovation than the Soviet Union. Technological innovation has enabled middle class people in our age to live better than kings a few hundred years ago. Also, looking at most of history almost everyone was dirt poor and more than 90% of the population barely made a living through hard labour on farms. Child labour was the only way most families could survive. Average life spans used to be very low and the child death rate extremely high. More people have died under communist regimes than even Nazism. Yes, communists killed more people than Hitler. Interesting fact is that Nazism stands for National Socialist party because they promoted a big nanny government that will take care of everyone while vilifying groups of people that did well such as the Jews. Research some of these topics yourself.An intelligent AI would hopefully look at the data and determine what economic policies benefit society in the long run. We kind of already know what policies work (2). Politicians like to buy votes using detrimental policies where people benefit now but their children end up with the bill. My ideal research project would be to create a software simulation of society where you try out different policies and see what happens over time. 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtJwAYJ9B082: https://www.cato.org/economic-freedom-world3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONATaFzi82I#Will you commies take a damn microeconomics class already. #This is inevitable, but the reason its not reality already is because politicians and bankers aren't ready to give up control.The closest we can get to optimal independence right now is to use cryptocurrency such as bitcoin instead of rands. It is free from politics as in no-one can arbitrarily issue themselves more. The next step would be to build systems that manage roads, electricity, education, communication, safety and water costs to be shared by the users on a voluntary basis (because taxation cannot be enforced on bitcoin). So for instance if you did not pay for police ""subscription cost"" then you are on your own when a crime occurs.Also, see https://www.ethereum.org/dao this has been attempted before but unfortunately the DAO got hacked as there was a bug in the code.

It needs to be snuck in and slowly take over the running of everything.#Oh god. Where to start.AI is still in its infancy and shouldnt be used for something like this.  Do you feel Google Assistant or Siri can decide serious shit?Also, who owns the AI?  Lets say you go with Siri.  Thats Apples property. So does Apple then rule us? Online referendums? Sounds awesome.  How will that reach all the people in SA when we dont even have electricity in some places?  Also who decides the questions and priorities?  Not AI at this point so who then?Dont go reading Anne Raynd as others have suggested.  That was one really messed up and incredibly selfish lady. You dont want that kind of thinking to be applied in any situation where someone else makes decisions for you.#>Because they'd tell us all to be communists?What's going on here? Between this and the self-post about libertarians, it's like this subreddit's developed a retard/EFF infestation.#Switzerland is ruled directly by the people and is mostly conservative and free market oriented. #>Rule by democracy simply does not work out in the long run due to the tendency towards socialism. Watch the Atlas Shrugged movies. Look up Austrian economic theory on YouTube. A good book explaining this is Friedrich Hayek's ""The Road to Serfdom"".This is the reading list a former teacher gave me when I couldn't fit any economics modules in. I read it all, bathed in it, and thought I was done with the topic.Then I got the next different reading list. And so on.Economy is the best possible allocation of resources. Capitalism has long fit this description, in it's many flavours, few ever approaching the vision Rand and others had. Markets have, are and always be limited - I believe that is just as much a force of nature as the invisible hand.Now I believe we have gathered the sufficient knowledge and manufacturing ability to take a frightening step past capitalism (as a species, not this nation specifically). A currency based on units of energy producing capacity. Instead of gold and other precious metals backing up your non-fiat currency, you use a portfolio of energy supplies.A universal income for all citizens, on the basis that every citizen requires a minimum amount of energy to meet their basic needs. This is much discussed elsewhere on reddit, there are good implementations and poor ones. Personally I favour a negative income tax.A partially or fully decentralised protocol for states, that can nest/stack to form regions and local councils etc. Democracy must be granulised, atomised even, and split up for thousands to take a daily part in. If fewer people are working, more will have the time to pick through legislation, scrutinise, etc.In fact, an ideal transition scenario for me features a healthy and functioning free market, with most people engaged in creative, academic, political, or leisure activities for employment.#The atlas shrugged movie was utter shit. Rather read the book :P#This is a brilliant point. Open Bazaar and even crypto dark markets like the Silk Road attempt to create an alternative space where government force is muted. All transactions have to be voluntary and nobody is compelled by threat of gunpoint. #Or maybe Helios?#This is just a theoretical discussion. AI is probably not ready for such a job yet but it can be argued that an AI would be much better than our current government.AI that is not owned by anyone can exist. This is quite a new field and I will not attempt to explain it here but a blockchain-based AI would be perfect for this kind of task. Read up on Ethereum and smart contracts.As for Ayn Rand being selfish, I don't agree at all. She is probably the least selfish and moral thinker you can come across. Almost all thinkers in her time were okay with the idea of the government forcibly taking money from one group of people and giving it to another. It was even considered morally good to steal money from hard working businesses and people through very high taxes and letting the government redistribute the wealth. If you have ever run a business or tried to move up a corporate latter, you will understand the tremendous sacrifice and hard work that takes. Having the government take nearly half your earnings is equivalent to taking around half your life. If taxing 100% of someone’s earning makes them a slave, what about 90%, 70%, 50%, etc. Stealing the money is wrong but the point of her philosophy is that it has a secondary more damaging effect. It discourages the creation of wealth that benefits all of society, especially the poor. Why start a steel mill if the government is going to tax and regulate you to death? Running high pressure jobs and businesses critical for the success of society leads to a lot of stress which decreases a persons lifespan and quality of life. Rather move to another country where the business environment is less stressful (Take a page out General Motors book). Put another way, if increasing taxes on cigarettes and alcohol is used to decrease consumption, surely increasing taxes on wealth creation reduces its production.#[deleted]#'fuck outta here with your different perspectives!'#Meh. People touting Anne Raynd as someone to look into doesnt help the situation - just as intellectually shallow.#Switzerland is an incredibly rich country monetarily. Rich countries will generally last longer than poorer ones. They are also a relatively small and homogeneous society. No matter how bad this sounds, extremely diverse populations tend to introduce a lot of overhead, inefficiencies, resentment between groups and political conflict (just look at South Africa). The Swiss population has a very high IQ compared to many other countries. Taxes are very low, government is small and decentralised. They do have much better policies than most countries. They are rich because they have low taxes and it is easy to do business. The most interesting aspect is that the country has many ""mini"" governments and policies that compete with each other. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSLs5G4SPP4#There could be other factors to consider, Switzerland is culturally homogenous and has a relatively small population. #Did you watch all three movies?

We have enough people calling for pie in the sky answers to our problems -  like land expropriation. Just because OP invoked technology doesn't make it smarter if it won't work now.  Sure un-owned AI can exist. But for now it doesn't. The closest thing we have is Siri and Google and i would also point out that the last thing we need is to replace incompetent and possible evil assholes that are voted for with an AI created and influenced by other asshole.  Excuse me for not waiting for OP's AI to appear. Sorry but I don't buy into An Raynds world view. Lots of people like it but they gloss over some of the darker aspects of her and the philosophy. One example that stands out for me is her view that the native Americans had no right to live on their land because they didn't use it effectively (as she defined effectively) That sounds great to some but it reveals a dark heartlessness at its core and I for sure am already tired of being ruled by people who have those attitudes. Replacing the ANC with a other heartless and inhuman group - be they private industry, military Gov or a democratic Gov - isnt going to make anyone better off. Worse, Rand removes the wealthy from the general population and places them on a raised platform and assumed the wealthy are automatically better than the poor. Edit to add:Raynd sounds good when you are in a position of power but once you have u have none it's bad for you. And a lot less of us will have power / money with the rise of AI and automation. Being selfish honestly does have some importance but it's not the basis for a society. Raynd was a hypocritical asshole who died using the government aid she hated others getting. She treated those around her terribly and was not a person  to admire. I already have Zuma - a selfish Ann Raynd type leader. #Thank you for your thoughtful comment. Ignore the guy calling it rubbish. The reason I like the idea of robots automating governments is because I don't think humans can handle that sort of power. I also think that the worst type of people are most attracted and most capable of getting into political power. If you look at history, governments have killed more people and caused more pain than almost anything else barring disease. Big government is the largest existential threat the world faces. AI might just end up being our saviours. #AI is dumb and dangerous. https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paper_clip_maximizer Please stop posting rubbish.#Too colonialist for you?#Who is touting Ayn Rand?#> Did you watch all three movies?Yeah, and the last one was literally the worst movie in the world. Sure, its hard book to read, but it is worth it. The john galt movie had a budget of $500. If you havent read the book yet, dont ruin it by watching the movies.#I prefer not to bother with unworkable solutions. The technology isnt there and OP has given no thought on implementation etc.  Some ideas are good but too soon, others are good but not implemented correctly.  We see this all the time - this is basically ""we got stoned and wow what a great idea"".#Ayn Rand was not perfect but you have a really warped view on her ideas. If the government is going to steal money from me, I see not problem with taking it back in whatever scraps the government hands out. At least she admitted that the money is stolen. I am sure that throughout her lifetime she paid out way more in taxes than any benefits she got. She would be disgusted by someone like Zuma. She was completely against enriching yourself at the expense of others. That was a core part of her philosophy. The fact that you can put her on the same level as Zuma has destroyed all intellectual honesty in your opinion. Thus nobody should take you very seriously. You are clearly too emotional about the topic to make any rational sense.#Go up a few comments.#Most people will never read the book. I think at least watching the movies in that case is better than nothing. #I had no issue with her taking the government aid she paid into - its insurance and serves a purpose. But she was well known for being against those same programs.  I dont belief tax is theft so I wont engage that concept. Its way to complex.Sorry but dont pretend she wasnt against enriching yourself at the expense of others. She was blunt about her opinion that native Americans had no right to their land because she felt they werent using it effectively.  'I dont see much difference between Zuma's personal theft and her views on conquest and land expropriation. Oh shit! She would have approved of the ANC if she felt the ANC would use the land more effectively.#I'm just going to assume somebody's decided to troll this sub with socialist and anarchist retardation.

No fear-mongering or anti-corporate propaganda.;"""Big Data"" isn't an entity so it does nothing with our data. ""Big Data"" refers to the concept of using large amounts of data to draw conclusions or direct action. Some company might collect ""Big Data"" about their customers and then try to draw conclusions about their customer base, such as what products to carry or advertise. Similarly selling that data to other companies would be profitable, and buying such data could in turn help grow a business.#Big Data isn't an entity. It's just the phrase used to refer to the existence of comprehensive collections of data, most of it taken from public record or purchased legally from companies you've allowed to have the info. Data brokers develop lists which incorporate info from many sources to create profiles of individuals, so they can sell the names and addresses back to companies that want to reach, say, married women with no kids and a house worth >$100K (or whatever).Basically, this is all about selling you more stuff, more efficiently. It's not a plot.There is another use of the word, which involves reporters synthesizing huge public databases to investigate whether public agencies and politicians are working for the public or for themselves.#So think of a company like Amazon. When you buy something on the site you don't just buy the first thing you see. You search, filter, read reviews, descriptions, change searches and so on. Well each of those is an event which amazon collects. Then they analyze this data. Now for 1 person it's simple. But when you get into the thousands/millions/billions of events like this occurring this get more complicated. Big data is just the process of storing, processing, and analyzing that data to help you make business decisions. Because if a person bought a washer than they probably need a drier. #They mostly use it to figure out what kind of person you are so they can advertise best to.If they know you are a parent and know your income and know the age of your kids, then they will make sure you are getting an ad for the brand new toy for your kid's age.Target did an interesting thing regarding that. There are certain items that newly pregnant women will buy. So if you buy those things, you'd get a special advertisement in the mail with a bunch of prenatal items. They [got in trouble](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-incredible-story-of-how-target-exposed-a-teen-girls-pregnancy-2012-2) a few years ago for it. What they do now is they'll send an ad with a bunch of sale prices for random things with a bunch of pregnancy stuff thrown in there so it doesn't look so creepy.#Computers are very good at finding patterns and correlations (one thing that affects another) Big data means collecting lots of data on lots of things and with the advances in computers power we can now sort through this data much faster and easier. #You want to see some creepy ass big data?

Many of these technologies have been used individually to some effect before, but together they make up a nearly impenetrable voter manipulation machine that is quickly becoming the new deciding factor in elections around the world. >The company is owned and controlled by conservative and alt-right interests that are also deeply entwined in the Trump administration. The Mercer family is both a major owner of Cambridge Analytica and one of Trump’s biggest donors. Steve Bannon, in addition to acting as Trump’s Chief Strategist and a member of the White House Security Council, is a Cambridge Analytica board member.>According to Zurich’s Das Magazine, which profiled Kosinski in late 2016, “with a mere ten ‘likes’ as input his model could appraise a person’s character better than an average coworker. With seventy, it could ‘know’ a subject better than a friend  with 150 likes, better than their parents. With 300 likes, Kosinski’s machine could predict a subject’s behavior better than their partner. **With even more likes it could exceed what a person thinks they know about themselves**.” >Where traditional pollsters might ask a person outright how they plan to vote, Analytica relies not on what they say but what they do, tracking their online movements and interests and serving up multivariate ads designed to change a person’s behavior by preying on individual personality traits. >For people in the ‘Temperamental’ personality group, who tend to dislike commitment, messaging on the issue should take the line that showing your ID to vote is ‘as easy as buying a case of beer’. Whereas the right message for people in the ‘Stoic Traditionalist’ group, who have strongly held conventional views, is that showing your ID in order to vote is simply part of the privilege of living in a democracy.”#Whenever you hear or see the phrase ""big data"", you can almost certainly replace it with the phrase ""behavioral data collected without your knowledge, and possibly consent"", and you'll be correct.""Big data"" is almost exclusively companies using this behavioral data to figure out how to better sell you things.#Target has gotten even better about picking out pregnant women. That teen had bought some diapers and other baby-related products.But now they've gotten so good at it that they can tell someone is pregnant often *before they themselves know* merely because their tastes change in detectable ways. Sometimes the first indication a woman has that she's preggers is noting more baby ads in more Target fliers.#This type of thing is one of the things that scares me the most about ""big data"" regardless of which side is using it. Manipulating elections or votes on important measures... this is dangerous to democracy and can only serve to acceleration our decline into an elitism corptocracy where the common people are more disenfranchised than they even realize.

linux;6cjvfx;1495410865.0;/r/linux/comments/6cjvfx/bias_aside_would_linux_be_a_better_os_for_a/;Bias aside, would Linux be a better OS for a University Statistics student?;So I'm a university Statistics major, with a CS minor. This summer, I decided to install VirtualBox and use CentOS distro since my upcoming Computer Organizations class uses this distro. After playing around with it for about a week, and learning basic command line commands, and creating some very Basic C programs, and tbh I'm starting to really like linux. This upcoming semester, I'm taking a Data Analytics and Visualization class as well for my Big Data secondary major. It'll cover topics in Unsupervised and Supervised Learning, along with an intro to parallel computing if there is time at the end of the semester (along with data viz of course). All of this stuff will be in R, so I was wondering, would there be any benefit to installing R on my VM and using Linux instead of R on my default Windows 10 OS? Would R be faster with Linux? I've considered ditching VirtualBox and Dual Booting, or even buying a secondary machine (not nearly as expensive as my primary of course) and dedicating it to Linux. Any tips? Thanks!;The best operating system is the one that does what you want.You can probably find whatever you need on any platform, but if you primarily use open source tools then using a Linux distribution would do you well because most software is a package manager install away.#Hi there! Statistics PhD here. You can use Linux, Mac, or Windows for your desktop analyses. They all run R and take you to the same internet so it doesn't really matter. If you end up getting a job in statistics, your Linux knowledge will serve you well, because you may end up running some computations on an off site server..... which will almost certainly run Linux! Caveat: If you need to do some C/C++ programming for your analyses, or get used to writing or coding in Emacs/Vim, then Linux will suit your preferences better.#There's probably not much difference. You can run R on either at the same speed. But running Linux is likely to make you into a more technical person in general, which can be a useful side effect.#You're asking for unbiased opinions in a very biased place. Realistically, you won't see any noticeable difference in using R on Linux or Windows. Personally, I recommend mastering one thing at a time. If I were you I would worry about school first, and then trying out Linux. If you really do want to try Linux, I highly recommend dual-booting from my own personal experience.#If you are only going to use R you can just stick for now with windows.But with Linux you have so many tools at your fingertips which are not available with windows or are really cumbersome to use. Searching, filtering, editing files is Linuxs' strength because everything works with files.Sure you can program on both platforms but in general it is much easier on linux since a huge amount of open source software and libraries are prepackaged and easy to install and a lot of documentation you find is for use with linux.Obviously you will not see a productive gain at first but you will have much less pain on linux when dealing with programming and handling edge cases.#R is fine in Linux.Also, if you do go with Linux, I recommend you Dual-Boot. It will be cheaper than a new machine, and faster than a VM.#If you can then do everything then it would be better.If you attend an interview after and they ask about Linux you can then say you used it on your personal machine during college vs saying you installed and tinkered with it a few times#Will you be fine with Linux? Definitely yes, as long as you need to use either open computing stacks like R or Python (Pandas, Numpy/Scipy, Scikit-learn), and even with proprietary ones that are reasonably well supported on Linux like MATLAB. In my experience, I haven't had problems with any of these.> VM or dual boot ?I would highly recommend a dual boot if you want to learn about Linux and its software stack, and also make maximum use of it. Specially if you are planning to work locally as opposed to a server. It would also help to avoid hassles with display drivers (and you will need it for visualization) and what not that you might encounter in a VM. If you're unsure about how well it will play with your machine, you can simply try it in a live session. Another reason to consider this is if you end up using software for which you need licenses like MATLAB. All this said, I would be wrong if I said a VM isn't likely to work. It's just that there's no reason why you shouldn't do an actual install. And of course, the usual disclaimer that I don't necessarily know what's best for you.VM or not, I'd say stick to Ubuntu (or the other official flavors) since it offers the most painless experience I've seen in terms of hardware support, and package availability. Unless you insist on having the latest and greatest of everything, this is probably what you want. Good luck with your career!#YesGo 100÷ LinuxYour future will thank you#Depending on the machine, you can install an additional HD or at least an mSATA sized SSD and give Linux its own HD. This way you can do full disk encryption. I recommend Debian.#I would be surprised if there were a single best operating system.

Great to hear from a Stats PhD! That's my goal ultimately as well. But for sure will stick with windows for now, until i'm 100% comfortable with Linux #Ahhh i do a lot of programming with Java, R, Matlab in school, and i'm starting with C next semester. So since i was gonna have to program with Linux for C, i was wondering if i should just try t dive in and use other applications i use often in windows to force myself to learn more#I find my workflow significantly faster in Linux because of thinks like bash, Kupfer, pandoc and R. Stats reports becomes so much more quicker with a mixture of gnumake, R and pandoc! I have even created a workflow for writing my thesis with these tools...#I recommend using a Linux distro as it is often more secure and harder to get viruses. Software (like libraries and programs) is easy to find in the repos and will be almost certainly virus free. Not to mention updating is easy. You will also have easy access to tools like vim or emacs. All in all, I recommend a linux or *BSD distro for you. Maybe even mac, but it isn't good as of late. #As a newbie... i only know what a few of those things are, so i'll hit the googles. But if you don't mind sharing, what was your thesis, and how did you decide on it?? #All of these should run on Windows these days with WSL or Cygwin. Not sure about Kupfer. #Yeah, I mind sharing publicly. You know, reddit is toxic. The thesis is ongoing, the decision on the subject happened together with the supervisor. Meaning I came with a proposition which was adapted to the tools we had at the lab. **edit** I see you tried your hand at CentOS, however for a first time, perhaps you would enjoy more a first time user kind of distro. Have a look at ElementaryOS or Ubuntu Budgie.#This is true... you can manage to do all this cool stuff in windows. There is however one more thing that people in research should be worried about is the privacy of your data. If you deal with patient data, for example, one should consider working exclusively in linux.#Ahh true true. That's fair. But interesting. I fee like i'm probably way ahead if myself, only halfway done with undergrad, but i'm trying to come up with ideas for when the time comes. Congrats, best of luck#If your dealing with patient data these days, you're pretty much stuck with Windows because of vendor lock-in...#That is very imprecise. Normally, studies don't use the same data in the registries of the hospital. Those are locked in. Since biographical information have to be taken specifically to research there is no lock in whatsoever, they can be noted down  with any tool.More specialised data like neuroimaging can be entirely handled in Macs now a days.Data from blood analyses of several types are in spat in CSV, and so on. Linux in research is a reality and should be encouraged for the privacy  of everyone involved.#For actual goundbreaking research (not common tests with simple data), the software is designed to run on Windows and patient data cannot legally be dumped without patient acknowledgement for processing in other 3rd-party programs. To do so you would either have to get acknowledgement from every single patient to use their data (even if the patient remains anonymous) and special privileges that can take anywhere from months-to-years to obtain permission for from the federal government unless you are somehow cooperating with a more established agency such as the NIH (even then approval takes some time), or there is a valid urgent critical need in which case your medical board will have to approve the process (skipping Stage 2 & 3).It's also important to note that beyond most basic tests, nearly all medical software is designed and used in a Windows environment hence why I used the term vendor lock-in. Although there is a plethora of data available online, the tools that you can actually use to process such data beyond a basic level nearly all exist in the Windows ecosystem such as basic DICOM files which I have yet to see a Linux Viewer that comes close to what other Windows DICOM viewers offer...Edit: Should probably note that this is a very simplified explanation of a long and often complicated process...

I've been feeling down lately and I've noticed a lot of other people feeling the same. So I wanted to put together all the potential biomedical treatments / cures that give me hope in the desire that others will benefit as well, and invite anyone else to add on with anything I've overlooked.I'll start with some broad trends, then focus on specific treatments, and close with a heartening real world example.Research. There is now more research than ever before. NIH funding has doubled. Prominent new researchers are coming into the field. And a very talented group of world class scientists and doctors are assembling at OMF in Palo Alto, California. Yes more funding is needed, but the momentum is very positive.Advocacy. Jen Brea, Congressional briefings, NIH, the demise of PACE are the headlines here as well as all the other advocacy groups building steam. This wasn't true several years ago.Broad scientific and medical advancement. There are new medical and scientific breakthroughs happening at an increasing rate. Broader trends abound as well: big data, precision medicine, gene therapy, stem cells, nano technology, metabolomics are just a few examples of ways humanity is galloping toward a brighter future with less suffering and more cures for complex and poorly understood diseases.One example: gene therapy can now cure leukemia and sickle cell.----------------------Now on to the tangible treatments and cures:A pathway for existing drugs.Ampligen may pick up steam in Argentina and Europe demonstrating to the new (more lenient) FDA it's effectiveness for the post-viral cohort. Remember that Ampligen has brought about bed bound recoveries for many, including members of this forum.Rituximab is looking likely to clear Phase 3 in Norway which means big money for Genentech and an option for the autoimmune cohort. Yes there is mixed anecdotal evidence for RTX in the US, but remember it has created long term remission for at least 5 Fluge / Mella patients with CCC diagnosis.There are other monoclonal antibodies that may also prove effective such as Bortezomib and Tocilizumab or immunosuppressants such as Cyclophosphamide and Rapamune. Additionally HSCT is becoming safer and more refined as an almost total cure for many autoimmune diseases.The African sleeping sickness drug Suramin showed promising results in a pilot autism trial and may soon end up treating ME/CFS metabolic pathology at its core.Ron Davis is using his impedance assay to test every FDA approved drug (the assay is also a potential biomarker). There are drugs like Suramin out there that have never been tried before. And given the success of Rituximab for some of the autoimmune cohort there is great reason to believe some of these drugs will be beneficial.A huge amount of research and focus is being done on microbiota. Refinements in fecal matter transplants and probiotics are occurring rapidly.New drugs on the horizonThere are new, better monoclonal antibodies being developed that can precisely target aberrant auto-antibodies while leaving the rest of the immune system in tact.On the antiviral side, drugs like DRACO are being developed to eradicate all viruses. Shorter term, a team in Rega, Belgium is working on a chronic enterovirus cure codenamed Compound 17 that is already eradicating Coxsackie B4 from the brains and organs of mice without major side effects.Dr Jarred Younger is working on a new version of LDN that can be taken at higher doses and bring down microglial inflammation (brain fog / fatigue) to an even greater degree.And a precision nutrient delivery system called Endotherapia for hard to treat long standing illnesses is being developed in France.----------------------This may all sound abstract. What would a cure (or excellent treatment) really look like and is such a concept possible? Yes and we don't have to go all the way back to Penicillin. Let's look at the amazing example of a drug called Sofosbuvir (aka Harvoni).For decades certain strains of Hepatitis C (a chronic virus in some ways similar to enteroviruses such as CVB and herpes family viruses such as EBV and CMV) had no cure or good treatment. People would often suffer devastating symptoms including organ failure, fatigue, weight-loss, jaundice, and cognitive impairment. Additionally hundreds of thousands would die each year. Treatments weren't great and had very bad side effects.Then sofosbuvir came along, with a total cure rate of 90%. This may still sound abstract, so let's look at actual patient reports:http://forums.phoenixrising.me/index.php?attachments/upload_2017-6-8_19-37-13-png.21773/http://forums.phoenixrising.me/index.php?attachments/upload_2017-6-8_19-39-24-png.21774/http://forums.phoenixrising.me/index.php?attachments/upload_2017-6-8_19-41-33-png.21776/These are real people freed after years (or in some cases decades) of suffering.

Mostly because of Davis's dogged determination.Unfortunately, I think Ampligen is dead in the water and I don't know what will recover it.  If Dr. Davis or Drs Fluge & Mella can find drugs that you take less frequently, I don't know think patients will continue to get expensive Ampligen infusions twice a week indefinitely. In the US it is down to one doctor giving it, and when the company revised it's pricing, many of his patients needed to drop out. Technically someone in Argentine can get Ampligen, but they have to be severe to qualify.

Would you invest 200 milion dollars a year searching for a cure for a disease that people can just get over on their own? There is no evidence people CAN recover either."

And I'm not quite sure if I should go for this program or not.I have 6+ yrs of software development experience in an R&D unit(C/Matlab programming). I don't have a data science background(Btech CS, from a lame college) and I'm honestly doing this to jump on the big data bandwagon.Now, this program has very high tution fee (around 35 lacs) and adding the other expenses like health insurance (optional ?), books, Student Life fee (whatever the hell that is), living expenses etc, they have asked me to show about 53 lac in my account. This is a huge sum. Though I can manage it, but I'll have to put in everything I earned so far and still borrow a major amount(more than half) from my parents.I don't hope to settle in US. My goal is to earn what I'm investing in the 1 year OPT period(any odd job will do) after completing course and come back to mother India with a degree in hand. But considering this is a very new program at Uchicago, there isn't much information about placements, program reputation etc. And I know nothing about the current job scene in USA.Can anyone familiar with this topic please share their opinion?Edit: dis program- https://grahamschool.uchicago.edu/credit/master-science-analytics/index;"[deleted]#Hey OP. Just checked out the website, and it looks like a very ""business"" oriented course. It does not seem to be overly technical. So if your goal is to continue along a technical career, i'd be wary of this program. If you are interested in big data in general, feel free to askedit: https://grahamschool.uchicago.edu/credit/master-science-analytics/instructorsthe set of instructors are also funny. I know a few professors in UChicago (in machine learning/ data science) and I don't see any of their names on there.#RemindMe! 2 days. #Univ. of Chicago is a great school. Go#thank you for your reply.I understand that the taxes and rent would take away a major portion of your earnings. But I'm having a hard time digesting this 'saving 1.2k with 6-digit salary' thing. I've friends who completed their MS and were able to pay off debts with 3 months' summer internship and 8-9 months' job post-MS.Heck, even an on-campus job pays you 700-800$ that you can purely spend to cover your living, eating expenses easily. What the hell kinda luxurious lifestyle you're living, brah ?So maybe if campus job can pay-off living expenses. I'll have to pay-off tution fees only. Thinking out loud here.Edit: Maybe I should mention that I don't wish to own any motor vehicle, house or anything. And I'm super-comfortable with shared residence option(super-stingy, you could say).#Uhh I paid 45k loan off in less than 2 years with a 6 figure salary, that too living in California. I don't know how you say you will have 1.2k to repay #hello. Thank you for your response.Yes, it is a professional course. It was recommended to me because I've sizeable work experience (6.5 years). This course also includes Hadoop, R, Python workshops. That might make me more employable, I guess ??By the way, their syllabus is given here (https://grahamschool.uchicago.edu/credit/master-science-analytics/requirements). If you know about the domain, would you be kind enough to have a look at it and let me know your honest opinion ?#I'm admitted to Graham School under Uchicago. Some say that this particular school isn't.. umm.. that much technical. Do you have any info on this particular school or course (MS in Analytics) ?#[deleted]#It's about lifestyle dude. #[deleted]#Yes I saw the curriculum before I replied above. Question: what do you hope to gain from this course? Like I said above, this course is more suited for those who might want to be a ""data scientist"" in a company that's not really into software development for example. your job might then be to crunch some numbers and give presentations to non-tech people. If you want to do that, then go for it. I am not very familiar with how the market is in that area. Also, this course is form the Graham School (which is neither the Engineering / computer science school nor the Booth school of business)#What about getting work visa?#You make around 6k after taxes if you have a 6 figure salary. Take 1.5k for rent, another 1k per month for car, groceries etc. you are still left with 3.5k!I paid 2.5k every month and finished my 45k loan in less than 2 years#I did my B.tech in 2010 from an not-well-known-by-any-means university. I want to have good qualification because some of the companies I know only call people from good colleges for interviews. It's been 6 friggin years, I have interviewed 6 IIT'ans for my team. Yet some companies such as Adobe never call me for interviews for developer's profile, cause no NIT/IIT tag with me. So yea, I'm expecting a good uni on my cv would open more doors for me.And you're right about Graham school being non-engineering, non-Business school. I chose it because the curriculum had all the buzzwords I was looking for to get into the big data scene. (Sorry if it sounds shallow, I'm being honest here)So to sum up, Uchicago just for the tag. Analytics course so that I can ride the big data wave when it hits Indian IT sector, and have a secure job for a good 7-8 years at the least.#> Analytics course so that I can ride the big data wave when it hits Indian IT sector,if that's what you want , and I assume you know how the indian IT industry is (because I have no clue), then OK. > I want to have good qualification because some of the companies I know only call people from good colleges for interviewsThe more workEx you have, the less your college should matter. Again I don't know how it is in india. I've interviewed studeents from IIT who had no clue what they were doing, and I've interviewed non IIT students who were very good.> Yet some companies such as Adobe never call me for interviews for developer's profile,My point is with that degree, Adobe might still not call you. This seems more suited to be a role where you join some company as a data scientist and run some stats on data, make presentations to businessmen who are not very technical. #Thank you, good sir!You have a good point about the lack of technicality with this course. If I think about it, coding is what I want to keep doing. I'll think more on this and decide soon. Again, thank you for your time. :)"

It attempts to classify AI into three camps: ""Narrow AI"", ""Artificial General Intelligence"" (AGI) and ""Conscious AI"", and claims that ""Conscious AI"" is also known as ""True AI"".  I've never heard of the term ""Conscious AI"", and a quick google search will confirm there is no common usage of the phrase.  Moreover, it's obviously an extremely problematic phrase, as it's impossible to determine whether a given AI would be conscious.  For now, it's sufficient (and standard practice) to just distinguish between Narrow AI and AGI.  The [hard problem of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness) is a completely separate issue and shouldn't have its own ""category"" when distinguishing between the two basic types of AI.#Whats the difference between AGI and a True AI?>For Artificial Intelligence to have complex, nuanced conversations that can pass for human, it needs to be able to solve new problems on the spot. It needs to interpret accents it has never heard before, vocabulary through context, and create sentences it has never had to express before.To pass as a human an AGI should think like one (not talking about turning test alone). Dont you think an AGI needs to be conscious for this?I personally think that an AGI would have the same intelligence of an average  human.#And also that juicy research flair.#Could be that consciousness is an emergent property of such a system. It also could be that consciousness is an evolutionary survival mechanism which isn't required for AGI.#A turning test seems like an interesting thing to develop!#[removed]#I tend to agree with this sentiment. Humans evolved the ability to think in terms of symbols in order to reason about problems *pertaining to survival*. The takeaway is that this ability doesn't necessarily have to exist in the context of an agent using it as a tool to survive in our environment. It could be engineered on top of any arbitrary system of inputs with any arbitrary cost function that is a function of those inputs. This capacity to think generally about problems that exist in the domain of our senses is really what AGI seeks to be. Given a perceived state and a desired state, AGI can be thought of as the capacity to 'select' and execute a policy that causes the perceived state to transition to the preferred state. #Avoiding the loaded term ""True AI"" (that's not commonly used and is introduced by this article without a solid definition), the current understanding of consciousness doesn't provide *any* way how e.g. a dialogue with a human could distinguish a sufficiently smart general AI without consciousness and a conscious AI. After all, a non-conscious chat system definitely can claim to be conscious, and how could you verify, for example, that *I* am conscious instead of a sufficiently smart chatbot in some laboratory?As far as we know, consciousness is orthogonal to capabilities  there definitely can be a somewhat sub-human level intelligence that is conscious, e.g. some animals, and it's possible that there can be intelligences exceeding human capabilities but not having consciousness. As far as I know, there's no solid science defining some limits of intelligent behavior where consciousness is *required*.Saying ""AGI and True AI is not the same"" is a quite fuzzy statement, since it depends what you're talking about  we don't currently have devices labeled ""AGI"" and ""TAI"" that we could compare, so it depends on the exact definitions. AGI is often used with an implied meaning of ""human-level AGI""  which assumes that it can perform any intellectual task (not necessarily including pysical tasks, i.e. not talking about capabilities of robotic bodies) that a human can, but doesn't necessarily assume that it's conscious.Can you elaborate on what ""learning opportunities are still severely limited"", what wouldn't be achievable by a hypothetical very capable general AI that lacks consciousness?

I've been a Full Stack Developer for most of my career and want to add Big Data to my list now. However, most of the tutorials I start to read about Spark seem to be geared towards beginners that don't have any programming experience (what can I say, I'm impatient) or they are rooted in Python which I don't really want to learn. I might consider Scala, but ideally I would like to find an awesome set of resources for experienced Java developers. A book is ok, but I'd rather some online course that offers coding opportunities. If you all know of any such resources please let me know.Thanks!**Edit** I should mention that I've been going to the source and reading the [Programming Guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html) in the official docs and finding this to be a really good starting point.;"[deleted]#I'm a C++ guy myself, but honestly you're going to have the most luck going to Scala and/or Python.  I can't speak from personal experience here, but the guys in my shop who got us up and running with Spark tried to do it with Java, and found that the language just doesn't lend itself well to Spark's paradigms.#Do yourself a favor and learn Scala. There's a learning curve, but in the end, you'll be able to write much more readable Spark code. Readability matters a lot when you're maintaining a code base. This is coming from someone who's implemented Spark apps in both Scala and Java and has been continually programming in Spark for nearly a year.#Databricks has a free community edition that gives you a small aws spark cluster to try stuff on. It also has some training notebooks that do a good job of showing you how stuff works and also let's you play around a bit. I'm pretty sure they're mostly in Scala but as said elsewhere in the thread of you want to do Spark learning Scala too isn't a bad idea. https://databricks.com/try-databricks#Instead of going with RDD, I'll suggest you go with Dataframes and Dataset API. Spark has released a unified API for both Java and Scala. I mean they have the same methods. Try to use Spark 2.0#The official docs and guides is the way to go. ""Learning Spark"" is a good resource but it hasn't been updated for Spark 2.0 and doesn't cover dataframes API.I found this course helpful [link](https://www.udemy.com/apache-spark-with-scala-hands-on-with-big-data/). It is geared towards beginners/intermediate but it has a scala crash course and Spark 2.0.#This is gonna sound weird, but go with me on this. Start the pyspark console. and then open up the RDD functions list, and just one at a time, do them on the console with some sample parallelized data.Then the dataframe functions. Once you've done that, you'll understand what spark about.Then basically go write some java applications that use various spark Java APIs#I concur with Scala here as the source code is all in Scala as well. #Also, if you're writing in Scala then Spark's RDD API is reminiscent of the Scala collection API and Spark's Dataset API is reminiscent of SQL.#Thanks: I think with the introduction of Lambdas in Java 8 most of the roadblocks have been overcome, but I think it might be worth breaking down Scala first.#Thanks: I feel like the course you linked to is going to be really good and I will probably give it a shot. I was also messing around with dataquest.io for their learning materials but it seems to be geared more towards Python.#It's really more then lambdas though. IMO it's the whole collections interface, spark is designed to operate in a very similar fashion to how you interact with data structures in Scala. This is true for rdds at least, dataframes are a bit different but regardless learning Scala will be easier on you in the long run. "

This is because Data Science is such a small part of your resume: You need a section that has all your data science projects and lists the key metrics. In my opinion, your professional experience and ""other interesting"" sections take up waaaay to much room. I would list your skills up top, Data science projects next, experience next, and then finally your education. This is how I built my resume, and I have a PhD. It was very hard for me to put my education on bottom, because its what I am most personally proud of. But skills and projects are what is going to land you an interview, If you were to apply to the job you currently have listed with that resume I'd seriously doubt you'd get an interview.  Those things need to be the focus of your resume, and right now experience is the focus of your resume, and it isn't strong enough to carry the day. If you previously held a data scientist position, then it would be strong enough. I also don't think you are a strong candidate for machine learning engineer, unless you are seriously underselling your development / CS skills.  Most of the ML engineers I know are CS majors who have C++/CUDA experience and knowledge of data science. They are building fast production ready models. Nothing on your resume shows you have any experience doing that. Perhaps you could land a Data Scientist position, but without knowing how advanced the techniques you used on particular projects I don't know what that might be. I think you'd be really strong as a Senior Analyst in a field you have no domain knowledge or a data scientist where you do have domain knowledge . An example of what I mean by your projects, for example is you said you used ""NLP"" to do something. Does that mean you used build a spell checker using some sort of Eigen decomposition algorithm or did you use an RNN(LSTM ect).  Specificity is the sign of someone who knows what they are good at, this resume reads as someone who found a bunch of keywords and put it on their resume. I hope this helps, sorry to be so critical. #I wouldn't list R, SPSS or SAS under ""Big Data""#Without knowing the specific jobs you are applying to the advice you will get will be shallow at best and dangerous at worst. #That stood out to me too. Fitbit was founded in 2007 in San Francisco. Date and location doesn't align with the CV.#[deleted]#[deleted]#Google has the founders of Fitbit listed as James Park and Eric Friedman--the name on the resume isn't either of those. I would immediately throw this resume in the trash.Sorry to be so blunt, but I think many hiring managers would do the same.#I'm glad you were ok with my feedback, I was worried I was being too harsh.To emphasis what I mean by programming skill, ML engineers could probably get through a software engineer interview. If you think you could do that, then apply to them. If not, be a bit more selective about those jobs. Also healthcare is one of the biggest domains for ML/DL. I interviewed with a company who is build DL algos to diagnoise diseases based off blood work, genomic history and radiology. I would call healthcare one of the major investors in AI.  Oil and Gas will probably also uses ML. Why can't a DS build algorithms that help make more accurate well exploration, for example.

Parenting;6df9s7;1495779984.0;/r/Parenting/comments/6df9s7/lol_game_addiction/;LOL game addiction;[deleted];"As a gamer, let him do it. he's 18 and found something he's passionate about. I don't think the right approach is to ""get him out of this LOL game"" but make him take responsibility.If he wants to play it as much as he does then he needs to contribute to the cost of your home, internet, and electricity. If he can't do that then you will have a problem.What was his response to having to pay for the electric?Also, LOL (League of Legends) has the largest online gaming community right now. It's the equivalent of the NFL as far as gaming popularity goes.#I'd look at it like going to the Superbowl, except he might get a chance to play with some of his favorite 'athletes'. There's not really much else you can do other than having him move out just so the problem is out of sight and out of mind, but it's not going to stop him from playing. While you see him as being socially withdrawn, he is probably gaming with a community of friends. I looked it up, and the last World Championship of that game was seen by 43 million spectators. But it sounds like he's got a job, and does things outside the house on occasion, and is already working on his future. Eventually, he'll either get bored and grow out of it, get too busy to be able to afford the balance between work and competitive gaming and go more casual, or some other game will sweep in and be the next hot thing. His job performance may suffer, and that's something he'll have to learn about on his own, through his own failures and triumphs. But if he's running up bills, charge him. That's not unreasonable at all, and the cost of his gaming is something he should be accounting for anyway. #Yeah, you can't actually tell another adult they're ""not allowed"" to play a game. But you can *absolutely* decide that in your own home, the Wi-Fi goes off at 11pm, and he should already be responsible for his own phone bill anyway. If he's going to be so energy intensive he's using all the solar credits for the entire household, he should be responsible for their value. Do the math on what your average usage was with him home vs not home and charge him the difference. From there, if he wants to blow his data and play to 2-3am, that's his business. If it just annoys or concerns you so much you feel it's time he's fully responsible for himself, that's yours. And both valid and acceptable. But at the very least he should be responsible for the actual costs of his playing the game to you... The upside to the moving out plan is that it means he'll have to work to afford his own connection, energy, rent, food etc... And that means simply not having as much time/energy available to play the game - which could be a good thing as I lost my first husband to mechwarrior/WoW... Game addiction is real.#How is it affecting his life other than annoying you?Is his grades suffering?  Is his hygiene suffering?  Is he ignoring responsibilities?If he is, you can make an argument that he should take care of important things first.If it's not really affecting his life negatively, then he should be able to do what he wants in his free time.#As others said, he's old enough to contribute money for his phone and electricity usage. You mentioned he does tennis lessons or what not, but maybe he needs to get a new part-time job to pay his new bills.Living at home is an ideal way to save money, but he's an adult so you should have an adult-agreement on what the stipulations are (maintaining a 3.0 GPA, 12+hrs per semester, list of chores).If he want's to spend his money on silly stuff that's his business so I would ignore the trip. Now if he says ""I can't pay for my phone."" You can point out a $1000 can pay for quite a bit of phone usage.As for video game addiction, it's a real thing and people are effected to various degrees. You haven't given the full story on your son outside of playing a lot of games so I don't think anyone can comment with good judgement on whether he's ""lost his way"" or not.Online interactions are social interactions, but they are not a social life. I would suggest reading up a little on video game addiction, but this is just like anything else. Games should be taken in moderation. You can help your son by trying to get that point across. I would recommend the approach of being a concerned parent vs the internet shut-off shenanigans. He's too old to treat like a kid. That being said, if things don't improve you need to have your plan for addressing that (charging full rent, kicking him out, etc.).#As a gamer, I'm noticing some serious red flags here. He has lost a job recently. That doesn't sound good. He's reducing his socializing. That's a big problem. Games are not an outlet for socializing if they interfere with well established relationships. Your kid is falling down a rabbit hole here at precisely the age that serious mental illness tends to develop in young adults. You need to intervene. Right now you're subsidizing his entire life so you have a lot of control. Put time limits on gaming and discuss your concerns. See if you can't get into hobbies as a family. Travel, bike, train to climb Kilimanjaro, shit do anything to get him engaged in the real world. Show him the kind of real experiences that money can buy. Don't just forbid the gaming, incentivize his exploration of the world. #[deleted]#[deleted]#Honestly, for a socially withdrawn kid, the convention might help as it's a chance to meet real people with similar interests.But unhealthy internet and gaming addiction can most definitely affect your ""real"" life.  At 18, the best you can do is talk to him. Making him pay for his share will help.  There could be something more though.When I was in the throes of starcraft addiction, it was a byproduct of depression and perhaps some counselling or therapy may help as well.#Well, I kind of think he is brushing you off because you don't get gaming culture with kids these days, which is kind of true.  And kids tend to stay up that late at his age whether they're out with their friends, or in with their friends on the internet.I would wait until his grades come out, or even contact his pizza employer if you really think he is lying, but I don't think you're gonna get anywhere if you can't show he is neglecting responsibilities."

apachespark;6fsfhs;1496829161.0;/r/apachespark/comments/6fsfhs/is_it_a_good_idea_to_use_spark_sql_to_perform_etl/;Is it a good idea to use spark sql to perform etl on tens of gigabytes of data?;I read this article https://aws.amazon.com/fr/blogs/big-data/using-spark-sql-for-etl/  that describes how to use spark sql to perform ETL using Hive and Spark SQL but I have a different use case.My data is stored in mongodb and it is approximatively 20 gigabytes. I know that spark is good for big data ( terabytes, petabytes) so I am wondering how it would perform on tens of gigabytes at a time using a basic standalone cluster, a single node ( 8 cores , 128 GB ram) or a master and a slave?I can perform ETL using mongo's aggregation framework and a programming language but I want to build a scalable solution. Also the aggregation framework is kind of limited when you want to run a complex query so you have to do part of the job programatically;You won't really see any benefit from Spark if you're not running on a cluster - may as well use Pandas at that point.#What are you trying to do with the data? You probably just need to do some data modeling and toss it on Redshift.#Get a 3 node EMR cluster of a reasonable node type and run some spark sql queries against your dataset, and you will be convinced it is fine. You may need 5 nodes, but ya.#Do you have any idea on the minimum node number in a cluster? #Doesn't that depend on how many cores you've got? Spark should be able to use every core on the node and you can definitely get single machines with 40+ cores. That's sure going to beat Pandas in performance for anything that can be parallelized.#Not really - I've only been using Spark since January.  We're using Amazon's services to dynamically add/subtract from our clusters as demand changes, which is really pretty great I have to say.  So long as you have a master and a task-worker, the paradigm will work...  but the more task workers you have, the better.  That said, when I can spin up a few bad-ass Amazon blades for $.70 a piece for 5-10 minutes, get my calculations/transformations done, and then call it good enough, it's a bit hard for me to even think about using my own hardware for such things anymore.Have to go with what the other guy said, though:  what, exactly, are you doing with this data?  I'm working with multiple *P*etabytes of data - 20 gigs should probably do just fine on your local hardware for most purposes.#You're right.  I was thinking clusters of cores...  I derped.#Separate question, but where do you store your data? I did a PoC for our company in Spark on EMR reading about 200 GB of data from S3 and the read took longer than I would have expected (10+ minutes), so I would love to hear more about what you're doing with PB of data.#I want to query the data and then compute sums and averages. The end-user will then query the computed data, then I want to apply the hierarchical ascendant classification on part of the data#S3.  We're running our Spark Clusters on AWS EMR as well, so it's all nice and local (to itself anyway), making reading and processing of all the data wicked-fast.#Sounds like you'd do fine on a Vertica DB.

I haven't had much guidance so I've taken jobs selling life insurance on commissio, digital marketing for SMBS ($1k deal size.)  After a year of unemployment, I signed on as the second SDR for a small company.  After 20 months I was blindsided out of the blue with a company downsizing.  I made a great move to a six figure closing role, but again I got downstized after being the number one rep after 6 months.I've been thinking about going to General Assembly to learn Big Data/python,javascript to make myself less disposable and to increase my technical knowledge in sales, possibly to move towards a sales engineer role.  My other options are to grind towards another sales job and face the risk of being fired.Are there an technical certifications that would help my career in IT?  I'm willing to sacrifice a year attending bootcamps/studying to network my way into a sales role, but unsure of what to do at this point.  Much advice would be appreciated.;"Theres a growing demand at most companies for sales analytics / strategy. You'd be the guy pulling and compiling data, building dashboards, making recommendations and driving sales strategy. The ideal candidate is an analyst who thinks like a sales person.

Thinking about a free course that is highly relevant to SMB tech sales. The benefits to us would be new hires would be easily able to get ramped up and ready to go & our management would be able to do more coaching and less training. Benefit to those in industry/applying would be the ""certification"" or knowledge of how an experienced sales professional gets b2b smb clients?

GradSchool;6g0zkf;1496929021.0;/r/GradSchool/comments/6g0zkf/question_on_low_ranked_phd_programs/;Question on low ranked PhD programs;Hi all,I'm not new here (due to dad having cancer, me panicking, but all being well now) but despite my lurking and posting, I have a question about life after this MA program I'm in. It's a terminal masters with no PhD, intended to get grads jobs in our city or DC. It does that really well because we focus on writing, presentation, and technical/programming skills necessary for industry positions such as analysts or research assistants. A few have moved on in other PhD programs in other fields. However a terminal applied MA is rare in economics, as in most are consolation prizes for PhD dropouts or cash cows to fund their PhDs. That's​ why I chose this program, there's no competing PhDs. I've been an RA and TA (non teaching) and my RA advisor wants to keep working with me for future journal articles once he gets back from his sabbatical. I'm doing a thesis rather than a capstone next year to continue this work, which could then contribute to a few papers with him. That'd give me three authored publications out of my MA and a few past students managed to publish their thesis/capstones. Of course, I'd be second author to my advisor on the non-thesis, most likely.So, I love research, that's great. However I have a few concerns that I was hoping someone could offer insight on.1. This program, being new and unorthodox, isn't a top ranked place despite having professors from high places, and a few lower. That was fine for industry locally. Is that fine for academia?2. I got a B in microeconomics in my first semester thanks partially to cancer entering our family and partially to a strict professor that gives the type of exam that everyone fails and the scale is arbitrary. My GPA with 2/3 credits completed is a 3.7 overall. Will this kill me?3. How much could second author publications help, if at all?4. My biggest reservation is my desire to stay in the Northeast. My family is here and the cancer really gave perspective on the importance of family. My husband also has a job here. I suppose I could apply to PhDs and jobs and decide later? If I'm not in an R1, I won't exactly have first choice of where I work and I can't see myself moving past Philadelphia.5. I'd like to have kids someday. Does it make more sense to get a PhD after they're in school? I'm already married and we've been saving for these things. My husband says to do what I want because we're only 23-24 but a PhD will put us way up there if we want multiple kids.6. Do econ PhDs really take the jobs of policy PhDs? I'm more interested in policy than econ but I'm not sure which is the best call. I'd need to take more math before I could get into an econ PhD. My main interests are agricultural.(Edit: As in, agricultural and environmental policy. I think incorporating economic optimization adds value but the field of economics tends to focus on big data in my experience to-date and with new/unorthodox technologies/ag methods, it's not always possible to run regressions.)I'll also add I don't mind if the main consequence of a low ranked is ending up at a teaching school. I'd love that!Thanks!!;Hello! Econ PhD at a low ranking school here. PM for any more questions1. Having a masters helps when applying to PhDs but mostly the number and rigorousness of the math/stats courses you took matters more. (in my opinion) 2. A B won't kill you. Just explain it in your personal statement and get a letter of recommendation that maybe highlights your microecon skills. 3. Having RA experience and a letter of rec from your RA adviser is probably good enough. A publication is good, but it really depends on the tier of the journal. Publications take a while to go through so it wouldn't be worth waiting the year that it might take. Highlighting your RA work and contributions to the project would be sufficient.  4a.HAHAHAHA, even graduating from an R1 doesn't guarantee you have a choice on location or type of job. Though there are always think tank and consulting firms in the Northeast that will take economists regardless of school quality.  4b. I think the biggest problem may be that the Northeast has lots of great schools (r1) but not a lot of R2 schools. Your fallbacks if you don't get into an R1 are not great. 5. Getting a PhD before kids might make more sense since the returns are greater. After your second year, the pressure reduces and you can manage having kids. PhD positions also offer more flexibility than MA industry positions, which makes having kids easier.(only if slightly)6. Look at Ag Econ PhD programs if you are interested in those. Unfortunately most are in the Midwest or West. From my knowledge  people from low ranking econ phd programs tend to get similar positions as those coming from high ranking policy schoolsThese are just my opinions. Also you never mentioned why you want a PhD?    #This is the Levy Institute, isn't it? If it is, I have a question to OP: how heavy is the Minsky bent, really?If you want to work in policy, get work experience in policy first. That will give you a better perspective on what you want to achieve and what will get you there. Policy PhDs do indeed work in policy (they certainly don't work in academia, lol), but it's harder to get a job. tbh I'm not entirely sure why you want a PhD. You seem to be a normal person who enjoys research and policy work, sure, but also wants to have kids and live close to family and not devote her entire life to Science^TM . If you want to work in policy and do RA-type stuff, you don't need a PhD. You're fine with the credentials you have. Go get work experience.#Rank plays a role in placement for Econ PhD's, but it's not the end of the world. Although it does sound like you're more suited for a policy-type PhD than an Econ oneIf you want kids, well, Econ PhD programs are notorious for taking longer than 5 years to complete. 6 seems to be the median from my anecdotal experience, and even 7 isn't too unusual #Thank you! I'll PM you tonight, just getting out of my internship and need to digest this :)I want a PhD for a few reasons. The first of which is to be able to continue research on the economics of renewable technology and conservation, specifically related to biomass and biochar if possible. The second is the opportunity to teach university level coursework. The third reason is the flexibility, by which I mean working different hours, not less. I'm very aware of the intensity. My advisor just went through tenure review (successfully) and he works all the time. He pretty much singlehandedly managed/drafted our university climate action plan and  its committee since his arrival in addition to research and teaching.Oh and I love writing and there's plenty of writing to be done in academia. Reading, too. Political economy was my second favorite class, just behind ecological. It's really outside of mainstream econ though. Night and day with neoclassical micro.I do have a good statistics background but I'm severely lacking in calc/advanced math. I'd need to take more coursework on that front. My undergrad was resource economics which only required calc 1 and ecological economics hasn't demanded much outside of stats. That contributes to my thought process on kids first while taking more advanced math and working with my current advisor. I wouldn't accept myself with my current math background compounded by the B in micro even though it wasn't related to math issues. :(Thanks for your reply!#> You seem to be a normal personThat or I aspire to be more normal and I'm undercover  )I'm actually working in state government right now for the summer. The guy who has my ideal role in our department/division has a PhD and it's essentially required. He does more technical research that I find interesting but it's just a different level. At least at some point I'd like to be there. He has a lot of flexibility and is a consultant in many ways with a dual role at a state university extension.I suppose I could do what my advisor did and just turnaround in my late 40s. At that point I'd just suck it up, take the math reqs, and go for econ. I mean given the consensus on policy PhDs, I should probably go that route regardless.Also, sorry but not the Levy Institute. #>  Although it does sound like you're more suited for a policy-type PhD than an Econ oneIndeed, this is why I was looking at ag economics last night. It's a bit of both with more lean toward econ but not so much as pure econ. That was my undergrad field and seems like a better fit. However being in the northeast I wouldn't have access to strong midwestern programs, so I'm just not sure. It's really just schools like URI, UMA, UConn (my undergrad).I think I'm just panicking because I took a job over going directly into academia from undergrad a and I really think that was a mistake. My brother-in-law did the same thing, got his MA then taking a job while his wife got her MEd, and now he's 30 with an infant and another year to go on his dissertation (hopefully) in a much less employable field. I'm a bit afraid that policy PhDs are less employable and it'd put me in a more difficult spot than he is in right now.I often hear that econ MAs don't get to do any interesting work, just kinda data monkeys that may manage some projects. At least for government and research institutes, which is sad because I want to do interesting research.However, at the same time I think as u/riggorous said, the opportunity cost is quite high for me now and I wouldn't get the writing I enjoy either. Maybe I'll just go start a podcast like Stephen Dubner with a blog and book with a crazy PhD willing to write it with me. Then kids will be less of an issue, I'd hope. :p#check out http://www.urch.com/forums/phd-economics/https://thegradcafe.com/survey/index.php?q=economicsThey have an annual post where people put their credentials and schools they got accepted too. There is some fibbing, as in all places on the internet, but I found that it was an accurate predictor of the schools I would get accepted too.Also just so you know, academic econ tends to be very model and metrics focused. So conversations will revolve around how the empirical results compare to the model or how well the model works or technical metrics. The policy or real world aspects are a sidenote and sometimes treated as a nuisance rather than  a driving motivation. Therefore you might want to stick to ag econ or policy. There is very little writing in econ even in low tier programs. My first year I wrote more pages of proofs than prose. Just like /u/riggorous mentioned. You seem normal, why do grad school?  You are more likely to get flexibility in industry, once you consider the income premium. You can literally take a year off every 5 years with the extra money you make in industry. Also a 9-5 is great because it doesn't consume your life. I almost miss my temp jobs sometimes. (sorry a bit jaded at the moment)#Like, I think it's great that you want to do more math and get into the PhD and be an expert with a strong economic background. My concern is that I think your expectations don't entirely mesh with reality.To me, your interests don't seem suited to an econ PhD. If you align yourself with heterodox ideologies, imo, just save yourself the effort and time. Economists take heterodox economists even less seriously than they take the other social sciences. I'm familiar with the Umass-Amherst program somewhat, for instance, and the employment situation is not pretty. Plus, I'm not familiar with environmental econ, but in the area I'm in, economic analysis and policy design are communal endeavors, and collaborators need to come from a mutual understanding of the issues and how to solve them. If you come in with crazy Marxist ideas or something, you just might not find anyone willing to work with you.Likewise, there's not a lot of writing in an econ PhD (which is a shame, because economists who go into policy need to be good writers). As for aspiring to an academic lifestyle, it will be a big struggle to get hired in academia from a heterodox program, firstly, and secondly, flexibility is a bit of an illusion in this field. People work all the time (conversely, in government, especially at higher levels, it is not definite that you will work on a fixed schedule, but you will almost certainly work much less than an academic). I have a few academic friends who have kids, and they don't see the kids much, and really have to rely on some form of full-time daycare in order to stay afloat professionally, because the workload is insane. Plus, you will have no control over where you live if you stay in academia. The market is extremely tight, even for economists.Finally, whilst I agree that an econ PhD is an excellent investment even if you don't become an academic, you have to understand that, when Mankiw said that, he was talking about the spherical future grad student in a vacuum: a (probably male) kid fresh out of college with no family responsibilities or strong ties, and whose academic background moreover doesn't need a lot of touch-ups to be admissible. The more you deviate from that profile, the higher your opportunity cost will be. If you need to take more time to strengthen your profile, and if you'd rather be doing other things with that time, it's worth considering whether this game is worth it. You're young, so you still have a lot of time, and if you were single and willing to dedicate yourself fully to academia for the next 10 years, I'd say go for it, but to me it seems that, in your situation, you can't easily afford to try a PhD out of a vague sense that you'd like to teach and maybe you want the same career as this one dude.#Oh no, don't be jaded! I'm not in industry but government, 9-5 today. The PhDs in the department get all of the interesting projects. I don't know if that's universal but it makes sense on the credentials food chain. Also not sure about income premiums in policy. Economists make a lot after graduating so the opportunity cost of being out of the labor force isn't horrible. This is even more true if I'm gaining utility through doing research and learning. :)I enjoy talking methods when I'm at that level of understanding, not so much when I can't grasp it. We'll get into more advanced stats next semester. Our first methods course was more heavy on stata with light theory whereas the next is flipped. Tools then theory. I'm excited! I do love application though. It's a shame that it's viewed as a burden but I understand why. You're probably correct on my fit though.I was in ag and resource econ in undergrad and loved it. My idol Prof that does great work in climate econ is in the regular econ department and reaches development, however. It's a rural university with an ag extension so maybe that influences the atmosphere? I'm not entirely sure but I could 100% see myself in resource econ rather than regular. I switched for a reason but that's not to say I hate stats/math. Or maybe I've just not taken enough to hate it yet.This said, my advisor had ag and he barely wiggled his way into TT at my university in regular econ. Are ag economists at a disadvantage? I'm not sure that industry​ would care much but academia might. I know the ridiculous job fair is full of econ PhDs (good luck!) but ag econ? Feels like niche econ and PhDs are already niche.I'm afraid to be the black sheep (no pun intended) of econ and not at a major Midwest/South ag extension school. I'd be more into URI, UMA, UConn as a huge maybe for personal reasons. Is ag econ dropped into the policy bucket or do we hold weight?Thanks for the link too. I appreciate your insight. There's a lot to think about!#Interesting perspective. I do get the vibe that single male kid fresh out of college is the target group and having my outlier advisor may be warping my views. He works non-stop as a prof. but he was in his 40s when he started his PhD. It's certainly not the norm in the department.Do you have any thoughts on ag and resource economics? My advisor got his degree in that (and that was my undergrad field) but he works in a regular econ department, and it is often in the other direction as well.Oh, and as a side note, I'm far from a Marxist despite my ecological studies. :)Thanks for your advice.#Sorry, I posted something but it didn't save.  Ag economists used to be at a disadvantage but I don't know if that is the case anymore. Often times their program requirements are a little less stringent.  For example ag econ programs may only have one prelim vs three for econ, which makes life a lot less stressful. In my opinion,  since development econ has taken off, ag econ is taken more seriouslyBest of luck.#I only know that ag econ is easier to get into than straight econ. I know people with such PhDs who work in policy at a high level. That's all tbh.#Good to know. Thanks :)#Hmm that's not surprising. There's also much less of them. Thanks again, your insight has been helpful. I think I'll work after my MA, have kids, and re-evaluate when they get a bit older, if I do it at all. I'll use my blog as a reason to learn new things.

Just to give you another option, you might want to compare your choices to a SuperMicro E300-8D ( https://www.supermicro.com/products/system/Mini-ITX/SYS-E300-8D.cfm ), or if you'd rather have the power supply integrated and it be rackable in 1u, the 5018D-FN8T is virtually identical ( https://www.supermicro.com/products/system/1U/5018/SYS-5018D-FN8T.cfm ). If you need more beef, the E200-8D comes with a hexacore and the 5018D-FN4T comes with an octacore.The specs and prices after you add the DDR4 and an M.2 SSD are VERY similar.. Bonus, it comes with two 10 Gbe SFP+ ports and 6+1 Gigabit RJ-45's (The 7th is for dedicated IPMI). Also you will get SuperMicro's KVM-over-LAN and all the other nice things about having IPMI. if you want performance and low power, from what I know, the Xeon-D's are quite good at what they do. These are pretty much top of the line for a little, low-power, quiet-but-packs-a-punch, and they're really well-priced IMO. I'm not sure exactly about availability/pricing in Europe, but I have to imagine it's similar.The only reason I can think of off-hand why I might rather have an i7-7th gen would be for streaming Netflix at 4k, which is only possible on the i7-7th gens and /nothing/ else. So if this is going to be an HTPC, keep that in mind.Also, remember, if you're trying to save money on RAM, you could always get one stick to start with, and add more as you grow into it. At least from eBay and Newegg over here, the 4x(whatver) kits are often literally four times the price of single (whatever) kits, for DDR4 anyway.#Also the [5028D](https://www.supermicro.com/products/system/midtower/5028/SYS-5028D-TN4T.cfm), which gets you four 3.5"" bays to play with.  I guess it'd fit in a backpack.#That's a great suggestion, I have to look into that, thank you!I was also looking at Xeon max. 35W CPUs, like the Intel Xeon E3-1240L v5, which costs about the same - and I have also a nice spare Mini-ITX case already, but I've not yet found a Xeon Mini-ITX board with an external power connector+brick that would match the case (no internal ATX power in case, too small). I keep on searching...The portability aspects is required because I want to take it with me also for demonstrations/teaching  - never trust the promised network uplinks...And I don't care about Netflix, it's for headless data crunching and testing/building/integration of packages before I recommend them or use them at the ""big iron"" at work.#Maybe I'm just being dumb but where is the price on the 5018?#Did you look closely at the E300 model I mentioned? It seems to be what you said you are ""searching"" for.. external power brick, mini itx, 200w total. Definitely fits in a small backpack.. the i/o options are awesome with the built-in 10gig, 6x1gig and the low profile pcie slot... The E200 is even smaller, and has a hexacore. You lose advanced networking options though.#Took a closer look, the E200-8D is really a nice box with the size/power I'm looking for. Unfortunately that's the high end of my budget, ~900 EUR without RAM... I would need to find it on sale/used somewhere... :-/#Yeah you won't, it's current gen stuff. Maybe a hundred bucks off max on eBay.. If you do build your own still, some of the ""ASRock Rack"" boards are pretty cheap and still have good IPMI/KVM-over-IP options built in.#Another thing I just noticed, e.g. the Supermicro X10SDV-4C+-TLN4F is ~550 EUR and has a 12V DC power option. So I could reuse my spare Mini-ITX case with that - but need to find a proper 12V external power brick for that... hmmm...#I bet if youlook hard enough you can find the one that ships with the E200?"

The Automatic Statistician employs a kernel search algorithm to provide a first step in this direction for regression problems. However this does not scale due to its O(N^3) running time for the model selection. This is undesirable not only because the average size of data sets is growing fast, but also because there is potentially more information in bigger data, implying a greater need for more expressive models that can discover finer structure. We propose Scalable Kernel Composition (SKC), a scalable kernel search algorithm, to encompass big data within the boundaries of automated statistical modelling.;Yes ... the biggest problem facing the automation of statistical modeling is an 0(N^3) running time. \*is sarcastic\*#Okay, what's the non-sarcastic reasons?

The topic was ""The Big Future of AI and Cognitive Technology"". I had a lot of fun writing it and talking about this future I see. I would love your thoughts. Sorry it's long! 20 minutes, you know? The slides were pretty much just titles with big pictures. Things like Wall-e and empty offices, and Hal 9000 at the end, of course. :) My original speech is on my LinkedIn post, but LinkedIn is banned, so I copied and set it up here. Enjoy!***What is the future?**Take a second to imagine a world where you can tell a computer your new business idea and it will research the idea, start the business, operate the business, and optimize the business completely on its own, without any human interaction. When we have reached this point, the need for human critical and logical thinking will cease to exist.The scary part about this is that many of you will live to see the day that world becomes a reality.Now, that is a bold claim, but I make it because my company is one of many that is working to make it true. And today, I want to walk you through what we are doing so you can see the future like I do.**Why I’m even talking about this**My name is Nick Szabo, and I’m the COO of Swizzle Global. I’ve spoken around the world on the future of artificial intelligence and cognitive technology, mostly because of the work we do. At Swizzle, we use cognitive technology focused around natural language processing to analyze customer feedback, and we are currently using deep learning techniques to build an AI that will automate the whole process. We have helped companies around the world, from banks to game companies, from Korea to the US.Recently I gave a speech at the Guiyang China Big Data Conference about the future of AI and cognitive technology, and I wanted to share my talk with you here. So this is my speech, modified a bit to be more easily read. Enjoy!**Cognitive Technology vs Artificial Intelligence**Before we start, we need to understand the difference between Cognitive Technology and Artificial Intelligence. Though these terms are often used interchangeably, they are very different.On the path to true AI, the first step is to make people smarter using technology. We want to really optimize the way humans work, so we can make the best decisions possible, based on all of the variables.Now, you are most likely aware that this is what we have been doing for decades with computers and big data. But in the past, computers were only able to help us with things that are quantitative in nature. Things we can assign numbers to. We can run really well made math equations (algorithms) on huge data sets and find incredibly valuable information, but when it came to finding important insights in things that are difficult to quantify, we were stuck. We still needed people to read words, look at pictures, listen to audio, watch videos, and learn from mistakes. And that is a problem, because we now have more words, pictures, audio, and video than we can deal with. And mistakes have never been costlier.This is where a new wave of technology comes in. Cognitive Technology.Basically a bunch of really smart people figured out how to make programs that can read, watch, see, listen, and more importantly, learn. This type of technology opens up a whole new set of data, and let’s us make incredibly smart decisions based on an awesome number of variables. And with the learning aspect, we can even leverage our past decisions.Cognitive technology gives humans the ability to make decisions based on significantly more data than ever before, but the key thing is that the humans are still making decisions. This is the big difference between cognitive technology and AI.An interesting side effect of cognitive technology is that, in order to create programs that can understand unstructured data, or data that isn’t numbers, we had to give programs the ability to actually learn. But now think about this. The whole point of this technology is to help us, humans, make smarter decisions. Now that we have programs that can learn and understand all sorts of inputs, we can tell the program what the decisions we have made based on the data the system gave us. And the program itself can start to learn why we made that decision, and can start to recommend future decisions, based on that knowledge.Eventually, the program will be able to recommend the same decisions a human would, except it will be able to calculate more variables, be able to make those decisions faster, and be able to optimize to a superhuman degree. This is when we hit Artificial Intelligence. A machine that does not help us make decisions. It makes them for us. When we reach this level, we will see a whole new level of job automation.We’ve seen this kind of thing before. Over the last century, manual labor has been steadily going to computers and robots over humans. They are cheaper, faster, more reliable, and don’t need vacation. Any job that is repetitive in nature has been in danger of being automated.But those of us in “thinking” jobs have felt safe. Those of us who make decisions, well, computers can’t take that! Right? AI is changing that. Actual artificial intelligence is coming that will automate thinking and decision making jobs. And when that happens, we are not ready.This is a scary future that most people on this planet do not actually think will happen. My team and I, though, are actively working on bringing this reality to life, and we are not the only ones. Today, I am going to walk you through what we are doing, so you can see the future like I do, and see how quickly it is coming for you.**Use Machines to make People Smarter**As I said, the first step towards getting rid of all of our jobs, is to make us better at our jobs using technology.At Swizzle, we focus on cognitive technology built around text analytics and natural language processing  Teaching computers how to read. The problem I solve is actually pretty simple. Companies today get TOO much customer feedback. Between emails, reviews, comments, forums, telephone conversations, blogs, and so much more, companies are buried in what their customers are saying. Inside of this feedback is incredibly valuable information, but there is way too much to read, so they are stuck.For example, we just helped a large bank. Their mobile app is ranked as one of the top 3 apps in the world, so you can imagine they get an insane number of app store reviews every day. Inside those reviews are bug reports, potential new product suggestions, marketing insights, PR problems, and so much more, but you can only read a small fraction of them. Using traditional text analytics solutions, like keyword analysis and sentiment analysis, they are able to see that some words have negative sentiment, but what does that really mean? Of course, a human could read the reviews and tell you what you should know and what you should do, but this kind of technology doesn’t dive deep like that, and a human can only read so much.Our solution is to use cognitive technology. Specifically, we created a system, called SIMON, that can learn what we are looking for, read for us, and tell us what we should know. The way it works is we pull all of the bank’s app store reviews and plug them into our Swizzle SIMON system. The system then identifies which reviews are the most important using algorithms we have made, and gives these reviews to a human, our data strategist.The data strategist then teaches the system why those reviews are important and what they mean. SIMON can now run calculations to learn why those reviews mean that, and take that knowledge and apply it to the rest of the reviews. When it finds new problems it doesn’t understand, it can work with the human who teaches it more. In the end, Swizzle’s system identifies, categorizes, and summarizes all of the important information that is inside the app store reviews, and gives it to the data strategist.It is really like a human working with a computer as a team.Now with this system, the data strategist knows everything he needs to know inside the reviews, and he has trained Swizzle SIMON to understand the reviews. For the bank, our data strategist understood exactly what they could do to make their app even better. He knew found who the bank’s customers think the biggest competitors are, and why. He uncovered buried testimonials where clients ranted and raved about how amazing the bank was. He knew what users really wanted to use the app for, and how the bank could help them. He knew every piece of important information inside the whole history of the app’s reviews as if he read and remembered every word.With this information our data strategist was able to talk to the bank, help them improve their product, and put together a report that summarized just what they needed to know. Using Swizzle’s SIMON, it was as if he downloaded all the reviews into his brain. Pretty cool, huh?**Use people to make computers smarter**So now the bank has a report and understands everything they need to know about their past reviews, but they still need a way to keep up to date on what people are saying in reviews every day. Just doing a report every few months is a quick way to stay out of touch with your customer.Thankfully, a side effect of using our system as a tool to help the data strategist is that the data strategist taught Swizzle how to truly understand what that bank’s customers are saying in app store reviews. And remember, the amazing thing about cognitive technology is that it can learn. We showed Swizzle’s SIMON what is important, why it is important, and what that particular bank’s customers mean when they leave a review. Now all we have to do is connect to the app store’s API and feed reviews into our system as they come in. Swizzle’s SIMON is now constantly reading reviews, analyzing them, and organizing them into what is important or not.Then, every week, SIMON creates a report of what is important to know, how previously identified problems are doing, and new information. This report is sent to our data strategist, who makes a decision as to what the bank needs to know, and trains Swizzle’s system further.To the bank, it is as if the data strategist is constantly just reading and remembering every review. It really is amazing, and keep in mind, this is not theoretical. This is what is happening right now. Today. The next step is where things get fun.**Artificial Intelligence**The next step on the path of us all losing our jobs is to move from Cognitive Technology to Artificial Intelligence.See, this whole time, the data strategist is not only training Swizzle’s SIMON to understand how to read these app store reviews, he is also training it how to interpret those reviews into important insights. Because this technology can learn, we can feed our client facing insights and recommendations into our system. SIMON can take this, and learn how a human interprets the data, and it tries to make those insights automatic. Feeding insights to our data strategist.Of course, these aren’t perfect yet, but soon, we will hit a point where the data strategist will not need to give our system feedback. Swizzle will run automatically and provide actionable insights of the same quality our data strategist does now.What’s more, you have to remember that this system is constantly reading reviews. It will be able to see the results of its recommendations, and learn how effective they are. Swizzle’s SIMON will be able to constantly find better and better recommendations as it continues.We can even train this system to know what teams need what information. If it finds a bug, it can tell the development team what they need to know to fix it. If it sees a PR problem, it can tell the PR team how to get ahead of it. If it notices a UX problem, a security alert, a product improvement idea, or anything, it can notify the right team, and give advice to take action on.Think about what this means. When we achieve this, there will be no need for anyone to read any app store reviews at that bank. There will be no need for anyone to look at any graphs, or analysis of keywords or sentiment. There won’t be a need for someone to interpret the results into something actionable. To communicate the customer’s will into actions. There won’t even be a need for customer surveys. The bank will have a system that does all of this, figures out what needs to be done, and then notifies the correct person on what they need to do.And remember, this is the step we are working on right now. This is happening today, not some distant future.**Automate Everything**Now let’s go even further and see how many jobs one AI can take.Instead of looking at just app store reviews, remember our product at Swizzle is to analyze all customer feedback. Let’s take emails, marketing engagements, comments, forums, blogs, survey data, telephone transcripts and more. Let’s put every means of communication our bank’s customers have through the same system we put app store reviews through.Swizzle’s artificial intelligence now takes in every piece of customer feedback available. Analyzes it. Categorizes it. Understands it, and builds actionable informative data from it. Swizzle uses this information to provide detailed recommendations on how to optimize your offerings, your messaging, your communications, and more. It can be asked detailed questions about your customers. Who they are, what they like, what they hate, what they want. Will they like this product or this? How should we approach them? Who are my competitors, etc.It can learn to identify PR disasters, before they happen, and help you get ahead of them. It can learn to identify new competitors or threats, recommend new products, or help you perfect your current products. It can do everything a human could, if that human was able to ingest EVERYTHING your customer says about you. Except it can do it for real, it can do it faster, it can do it better, and it can do it cheaper.When Swizzle’s AI can take in all customer feedback, it will have the capacity to replace human decision making in marketing research, customer analytics, product development research, parts of customer service, and more. You will now have a singular, intelligent entity that will take over listening to your customers, and recommend what you should do.The next step is team Swizzle up with all the other AI’s.**Who else is building AI?**Because, remember, this path I took you down is the path of one company. It is what we are working on, and it started with us just trying to make app store reviews more useful.You know we are not the only one solving business problems with cognitive technology. Other companies around the world are working on technology to help businesses with business intelligence, marketing automation, product development, financials, and so, so much more. Every aspect of running a business is currently being taught to a computer somewhere in the world in hopes of making things easier and more efficient. And every one of those companies are pushing toward automation. And that is happening right now!**An intelligent company**They are all building AI’s that will perfectly optimize their section of business. And when they all succeed, how long will it take for someone (or something) to piece it all together? To take all of the different AI’s, make them communicate with one another, and make one, incredible company that does not need humans. It will be able to research new ideas, start new businesses, operate those businesses, and optimize them without any human.Every aspect of running a business is currently being taught to a computer somewhere in the world in hopes So you ask me, what is the future of AI and cognitive technology? It is beautiful, amazing, optimized to a whole new degree. And it has little place for humans.**My Advice**Does this scare you a bit? My advice? Find all the different companies out there that are automating various aspects of your business. Go out of your way to engage with them. Take some risks and try to find what parts of your business you can automate. Keep an open mind and try to trust technology more. If you get ahead of this, you'll lead the way. If you try to follow, you might never catch up...";" ""We still needed people to read words, look at pictures, listen to audio, watch videos, and learn from mistakes. And that is a problem, because we now have more words, pictures, audio, and video than we can deal with. And mistakes have never been costlier."" Great insight. Still reading.     ""The whole point of this technology is to help us, humans, make smarter decisions. Now that we have programs that can learn and understand all sorts of inputs, we can tell the program what the decisions we have made based on the data the system gave us.

""    You make it sound like what is already happening with Amazon, Facebook, Google and other recommendation software. Which means it's happening right now, just getting better. #""Of course, these aren’t perfect yet, but soon, we will hit a point where the data strategist will not need to give our system feedback. Swizzle will run automatically and provide actionable insights of the same quality our data strategist does now.""    Ok Nick, this is where it seems to get critical for the efficacy of AI: When the game starts changing. For example, let's say everything is tuned and then a crisis occurs, for example an East Coast Hurricane, totally changing the picture of banking dynamics. Remember the crisis in Japanese nuclear plant? The learning AI has new data to deal with and we can envision humans needing to step in.     But here's the rub: by this time, the learning/decision process of the AI has moved beyond human ability and is largely opaque to human scrutiny. Outputs become unexpected. Remember the chatbot that developed a racist attitude? Remember the stock market flash crashes?     I'm not advocating a kill switch. That seems ludicrous. But surely you've thought about this scenario. What preparations are being made ?    #Pretty much.  That point of my speech was supposed to be going over the difference between cognitive technology and AI.  And for that section, I was laying the groundwork for the past.  We definitely have cognitive technology today, and it is definitely pretty advanced.  The power houses like Amazon and Google are doing crazy things with it, but also the technology is widely available, so the smaller guys, like us, are able to do incredible things as well.  It is all getting better, and will eventually get to AI (in some cases already has).#Well, in our particular scenario, there actually is a human in the system.  Just that human can now operate the customer feedback analysis for 10s or 100s of accounts, vs multiple humans needed to run a single account.  Kind of like how a robot replaces factory workers, but you still need someone in case the crazy thing happens.Of course, theoretically, after a few crises happen, the learning aspect of the system should be able to figure things out.  The other side of the coin is, if the system is learning off its own external data it is collecting, and has enough knowledge bases of solutions, will it be able to be reflexive enough to take care of a crisis on its own?  We honestly don't know yet.#I'm out of my field, but it would be interesting to learn what happened with the flash crashes. I believe a stop trading circuit breaker was implemented, but chances are they've refined it since then.     The human action is usually to say 'this will never happen again' and then six months later, it happens again. Then an extensive investigation is undertaken with a committee, and a report is issued. And maybe something gets done. "

The problem with any kind of prediction like this is the human element. You can account for specific tank strengths on specific maps with or without certain enemy tanks present and you can account for the players' past performance in any given tank. But that's it. You're using statistical data, averages. You can't predict small scale human behaviour (like quick reactions in a unique situation) based on data like this. Not to mention that your algorithm (as /u/sanchito83 said) can not know if the player is drunk, sober, high, in a good/bad mood, depressed, tired, etc. which all influence their playstyle heavily.Also RNG.#You overestimate the ability of Big Data to correctly predict winners (#Hillary2016).#> we've got an XVM mod which can tell us the win chance for the current matchThey removed it.

Everyone will play normally as usual and there will be a 95% chance that the prediction will be accurate.  However, knowing human behavior, this is unlikely.2. The team predicted to lose will not bother trying because you can't change fate, thus confirming the prediction.3. The team predicted to win will be over-confident and not try too hard, and/or the team predicted to lose will shake their fist at the black box gods and say, ""Only I control my destiny!"" and play as best as they can.  The result will likely be different than the prediction.#So what you're saying is > This would be as accurate as the current win chance, i.e. somewhere between very and not at all.^^ )#Um....

Thanks.#Ryzen does seem to be pretty popular, but I've not researched into it so can't comment on it.#From the research I've done, the main difference is core count.What this results in is the i7-7700k will perform better with applications and use cases that utilize 4 or less cores (because its cores have a higher speed), but Ryzen 7 will perform better if more cores are being utilized. I noticed you mentioned big data analysis in your post. If the tools you are using to do this are utilizing all available cores/threads of your CPU, then Ryzen will very likely be a stronger option. The trade off is that you will likely get a small decrease in FPS while gaming.I'd recommend checking out some benchmark tests to see the kind of performance others have been getting with a similar setup and then you can decide which trade-off makes the most sense for you.

Now I'm working on a Mac, which is cool, but I feel like I lack a lot of basic understanding of how things works.I follow basic tutorials and copypasta commands whenever I'm trying to accomplish tasks like work with github, open ssh, install various packages (pip/brew/whatever?), but I can't really tell what are good practices and what aren't. I've always tried to understand why I'm doing certain things and how they work under the hood, avoiding blindly repeating some instructions.

Also, is getting a Masters pretty much required?;Data science has one of the highest growth rates of any job on the planet.#I was specifically referring to BI not Data Science#Data engineering probably would be next after data science.

I am currently using MS Excel to forecast my data. It is a pretty comfortable job and pays well. I have completed my Master's degree in Engineering a year back. So basically life is pretty steady right now. I want to get into the field of Big Data Analytics and Data Mining. I am well adept of using different forecasting techniques for data analysis. I am a beginner to average level coder in R. I want to implement some of the techniques in our current business model as well. But, I wanted to know, what would be the next logical step in transitioning from a person using Excel right now to a person adept at Data Analysis. Any certifications which would help me improve myself?Or has anyone gone through the same process and have any specific recommendations?Help is greatly appreciated! ;"SQL is definitely the best place to start. I wouldn't worry too much about different subsets of SQL/MySQL because if you know one, learning another, for the most part, is really easy. A great way to learn R and also machine learning is An Introduction to Statistical Learning (http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). Another book I would check out is The Data Warehouse Toolkit. It's a great introduction to schema modeling and uses many different examples. Data visualization is the easiest thing to learn. Tableau and Power BI are extremely easy to learn. I currently work with Power BI and had no prior experience. Another great resource is Azure. They offer a one month free trial with a $200 credit. Keep in mind though, that you only have one month to use the credit, so when you start it, study hard. With my current project we do machine learning on Azure, and it's really simple to use. For statistical analysis I would just use R Studio. If you can do correlation analysis, linear regression testing, etc.. in there, you can easily do it in any proprietary software. We use SPSS and it was very easy to pick up. Lastly, I would figure out a direction you want to go with big data. I'm not saying you have to restrict yourself, but once your foot is in the door it makes understanding what to learn much easier and helps you not get bogged down thinking you have to learn the million flavors of SQL. Right now I am doing BI consulting at Microsoft, but I also help out with analytics for a smart city project. If you have further questions don't hesitate to shoot me a message. I spent 11.5 years in the Navy, left and got my degree in math, and then into big data. So I definitely understand the position you are in.#Your post actually mentioned my usual advice to this question: ""I want to implement some of the techniques in our current business model as well""The best way to learn a new language or approach to tackling data science is to take an existing process and replicate it in something like Python or R. If there is a report that you have to generate in Excel periodically, see if you can automate it with Python or VBA even.Also, for what it's worth, I would throw Python into the mix as far as a language to get started with.  I don't think anyone else has mentioned it yet.  VBA is another good programming language to start with because it sits underneath of Excel, so if you create an Excel tool using VBA, your colleagues will be able to use it without having to install Python/R, etc.  #It would definitely be useful to have a background in SQL.  Most big data query languages use SQL or something derived from SQL: HiveQL, Spark SQL, Cassandra CQL, U-SQL etc. they all have their roots in SQL proper.  Plus, visualization is another requirement. Knowing PowerBI, Tableau or other presentation layers are helpful.  MapR has some free training courses on Spark.  The Hortonworks certifications are pretty accessible.  If you're interested in the Microsoft ecosystem, I think Microsoft just introduced a MCSA certification on machine learning.#Hey, Thanks so much for the info. Greatly appreciate it. So the general inclination which I am getting is to learn SQL and R Studio. That book seems to be really good at first glance. Should be able to cover a lot of ground in terms of Statistical Analysis. I am not very concerned about data visualization. I was extremely comfortable using whatever the numerous data visualization software I used. In terms of the direction I wanted to go. I actually have very little or no knowledge of even the various career directions in front of me with respect to Big Data Analytics. Of course my Masters degree did help me but I would say it was not directed well now when I come to think of it. So I just needed some guidance from someone who has experienced it first hand. I will definitely stop being lazy and get back to you if I have any more questions.

I regret going the liberal arts route (wanted to go to law school initially). How does one go about breaking into STEM for a masters degree at this point / is it possible? I'm very interesting in pursuing some sort of degree within statistics or big data, would a second bachelors be necessary at this point? Thank you. ;Why'd you change your mind from law school?#You might want to narrow it down STEM covers hundreds of things.  Many options might require technical training rather than a graduate degree#You're looking at minimum 2 years of post-baccalaureate work if you haven't taken any math classes...#Depends on the grad program.  You may need some prerequisite courses, but likely not a full second bachelor's degree.#I'm not the OP, but I can give you a couple reasons why students turn away from law school. 1) The legal market is shot to hell. The supply of lawyers is far greater than the demand. 2) Law school is extraordinarily expensive for most#Pretty much for these reasons.
bigdata;6dfhqu;1495783585.0;/r/bigdata/comments/6dfhqu/moving_from_the_ms_bi_space_to_gcp_big_data_space/;Moving from the MS BI space to GCP big data space. Need information.;Hi fellow data nuts,On July 1, I will be moving from a BI developer (ETL, data warehousing) using the MS SQL platform to being a data engineer at a data science firm, using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to work with big data.My current role sees me making exclusive use of SQL Server and SSIS for my ETL and data modelling purposes. The new role requires knowledge of SQL (which I have, 4 years) and Python (which I have, ~2 years). The technologies I will be exposed to are:* The entire GCP suite, with specific focus on BigQuery, Compute Engine, and Kubernetes (spelling?).* I will also be exposed to and required to work with technologies like Apache Hadoop, Apache Airflow, etc.Yes, I am nervous about it, because I've never worked with data at this scale and all the data I've worked with has been structured, according to the requirements of 3NF, before modelling it and storing it in a Kimball inspired data warehouse.I ask the following:1. What are some of the pitfalls I need to be aware of?2. What are good resources for learning about big data?3. What will the biggest shock be in terms of the technical aspect of the move?;So Big Table excels when all your data is in one big denormalized table. Complete opposite of what you're used to.If they are using Hadoop technologies it'll get weirder yet In that you are storing files,and putting the scheme on them later.#You can organize collaboration with other data scientists (make your data science projects reproducible and shareable) by sharing datasets thru GCP cloud storage (while keeping the code on Git) using this new tool for version control and iterative machine learning - http://dataversioncontrol.com#Awesome. Thanks for the response. I should have figured that BigQuery being a columnar style *RDBMS* (I use that term **very** loosely) would have been similar to SAP HANA, in that highly denormalised tables are preferred due to the underlying architecture. Could I ask you to elaborate more on what you mean by:> ... in that you are storing files, and putting the scheme on them later.From my understanding about what Hadoop is and what it does, is it takes data (often contained in a text file for instance) and breaks it into chunks and then distributes the work amongst worker nodes, runs some function or set of functions on the data and returns a set of aggregated data.The only way I can relate to your quoted statement, is that I will supply data (whatever the source may be) to Hadoop, run a set of functions on it, get the results, and then store that into some form of an RDBMS for querying and analysis by more *traditional* systems. Is this correct?#Hadoop is a collection of technologies, but the biggest component is HDFS, the Hadoop File System. Yes it breaks up your data into chunks, but it's doing that at the file level. There are of course file formats that resemble what you would see in a database, like Hive's ORCFile format, or Sparks Parquet format. But largely Hadoop is a big file system and the different engines that sit on top of it don't need to know how you want to structure the data until it's time to actually use it.
Harvard;6fql4v;1496802167.0;/r/Harvard/comments/6fql4v/developing_hes/;Developing HES;Inspired by the last poster, I thought I'd pose this to the community:I took Big Data Systems, a 2xx level class, and it was amazing. It was a smattering of PhDs, master's students and the occasional undergrad or Extension student (like me). Super smart, the lot of them.I wish HES would run more 2xx level courses parallel with FAS. Is there some way to talk the administration into emphasizing these types of classes? The NUMBER of courses offered thru HES has been growing like wildfire the last couple of years after staying around 500 for over a decade - I really wish there were a way to influence the direction of the curriculum's development, especially in CS.Ideas?;"Your professors should know. They'd be instrumental to the process at some point, so it'd only benefit you to involve them from the outset. #I'm not sure how HES is governed since they're technically part of FAS, but at other harvard schools things related to curriculum usually initiated and discussed at faculty meetings. So faculty might still be the right starting point, maybe there is an Extension or department equivalent to look into, or someone in that arena at least to help you get started?#I agree. And I've made my thoughts on that known to ones I've had the privilege to study under. But I know also there are people who specialize in administration, and they play a role too for sure.#If you name the person, I'll gladly talk with him or her. :)#Sorry if I was unclear. I have almost zero experience in extension school admin so I don't know anyone, but maybe try looking for info on whoever is in charge of faculty/academic affairs? At the other schools, the title would be something like ""Associate/Assistant Dean of Faculty and Academic Affairs"". I'm really not sure how the extension school is governed since technically they are part of FAS.I worked with an equivalent person like this at another school, and generally what would happen is that a faculty member would be the one bringing an idea for academics/teaching because they would later be presenting the idea to the rest of the faculty. This person would mostly just review if it was ready to be brought to the rest of the faculty/if it needed to be voted on/logistical things like that, but had a minimal role in initiating things aside from being a voting member of the faculty."

Big data is in general a lot of smaller machines grouped together to handle tons and tons of data.  This data is often times not structured well, so instead of parsing it once in a long arduous process and storing it on a big, big machine, it keeps the data in sometimes a more loose format, and searches and groupings are done at the individual computer level.  Since there are many computers, you can just add and add and pretty much get near infinity (okay, that's an exaggeration) of space.  With nearly unlimited data, and computing, sorting, grouping done in a distributed fashion through many, many off the shelf, cheap computers, data can be analyized and patterns can be found way beyond the normal, pre big data sets of data we had before.#No, no, no, NoSQL#150kb?

statistics;6f4arm;1496533148.0;/r/statistics/comments/6f4arm/graduate_stats_and_medical_technology/;Graduate stats and medical technology;I've recently posted on this subreddit, but have another career-related question. I've been interested in pursuing an MD/PhD in biostatistics, and delving deeper into clinical trials. However, a big goal of mine is to use my analytical knowledge and understanding of medicine to create a health technology business or clinical trials organization of my own. As an undergraduate and a first-generation URM student, it's been hard finding direction with my goals, as the advisors at my school don't know much and are hard to reach. I have competitive grades and I've been enjoying the research I've been doing (epidemiology and longitudinal data analysis), but have no real understanding of the academic pathway. My question is whether or not this is a logical plan and what schools/what kind of research I should understand to gain the most. There's a lot of research being done in sensor technology, and I think it'd be cool to see how that interrelates with big data analytics, but that often seems to fall under bioengineering. Is it possible to be interdisciplinary in a field like this? Any advice will be greatly appreciated!;I really don't think anyone can answer your question, since overall you should pursue what you are interested in. if you are interested in sensor technology then look for mentors in that area.. Biostatistics and Epidemiology are very interdisciplinary.#Biostat has the potential to be this --- a lot of it is what you make of it (and which institution you end up at). For example, the University of Washington, and Johns Hopkins biostat departments have several world-class faculty working on design and implementation of clinical trials (Tom Fleming, Scott Emerson @ UW, Michael Rosenblum @ hopkins for example)  and working on big data analytics (Daniela Witten, Ali Shojaie @ UW, Jeff Leek, Brian Caffo @ Hopkins). I don't know if they are doing work on sensors, but I think there have been a number of spinoff CROs (that contract to run the organizational and statistical aspects of clinical trials). There are other places doing this too: (maybe under the bio(medical)informatics title --- I might look into biomedical data science at Stanford).An MD/PhD is a sort of complicated animal and takes many many years (though I know a person or 2 who took this route). Alternatively, you could do a PhD and concentrate on medical applications  or an MD and get an MS on the side though.#If you want to go the MD/PhD route I would not recommend biostats. Instead go with Epi. The training and time it takes to develop methods in bio stats doesn't line up well with the MD PhD timeline - nor will it be easy when your a clinician. If you're an applied epidemiologist then you can still do the trial stuff you're interested in but your promotion track will align more with papers you can actually write while seeing patients. Of course, if you're committed then I'm sure you can make anything work

The topic was ""The Big Future of AI and Cognitive Technology"". I had a lot of fun writing it and talking about this future I see. I would love your thoughts. Sorry it's long! 20 minutes, you know? The slides were pretty much just titles with big pictures. Things like Wall-e and empty offices, and Hal 9000 at the end, of course. :) My original speech is on my LinkedIn post, but LinkedIn is banned, so I copied and set it up here. Also, I posted this on r/futurology as well. Enjoy!***What is the future?**Take a second to imagine a world where you can tell a computer your new business idea and it will research the idea, start the business, operate the business, and optimize the business completely on its own, without any human interaction. When we have reached this point, the need for human critical and logical thinking will cease to exist.The scary part about this is that many of you will live to see the day that world becomes a reality.Now, that is a bold claim, but I make it because my company is one of many that is working to make it true. And today, I want to walk you through what we are doing so you can see the future like I do.**Why I’m even talking about this**My name is Nick Szabo, and I’m the COO of Swizzle Global. I’ve spoken around the world on the future of artificial intelligence and cognitive technology, mostly because of the work we do. At Swizzle, we use cognitive technology focused around natural language processing to analyze customer feedback, and we are currently using deep learning techniques to build an AI that will automate the whole process. We have helped companies around the world, from banks to game companies, from Korea to the US.Recently I gave a speech at the Guiyang China Big Data Conference about the future of AI and cognitive technology, and I wanted to share my talk with you here. So this is my speech, modified a bit to be more easily read. Enjoy!**Cognitive Technology vs Artificial Intelligence**Before we start, we need to understand the difference between Cognitive Technology and Artificial Intelligence. Though these terms are often used interchangeably, they are very different.On the path to true AI, the first step is to make people smarter using technology. We want to really optimize the way humans work, so we can make the best decisions possible, based on all of the variables.Now, you are most likely aware that this is what we have been doing for decades with computers and big data. But in the past, computers were only able to help us with things that are quantitative in nature. Things we can assign numbers to. We can run really well made math equations (algorithms) on huge data sets and find incredibly valuable information, but when it came to finding important insights in things that are difficult to quantify, we were stuck. We still needed people to read words, look at pictures, listen to audio, watch videos, and learn from mistakes. And that is a problem, because we now have more words, pictures, audio, and video than we can deal with. And mistakes have never been costlier.This is where a new wave of technology comes in. Cognitive Technology.Basically a bunch of really smart people figured out how to make programs that can read, watch, see, listen, and more importantly, learn. This type of technology opens up a whole new set of data, and let’s us make incredibly smart decisions based on an awesome number of variables. And with the learning aspect, we can even leverage our past decisions.Cognitive technology gives humans the ability to make decisions based on significantly more data than ever before, but the key thing is that the humans are still making decisions. This is the big difference between cognitive technology and AI.An interesting side effect of cognitive technology is that, in order to create programs that can understand unstructured data, or data that isn’t numbers, we had to give programs the ability to actually learn. But now think about this. The whole point of this technology is to help us, humans, make smarter decisions. Now that we have programs that can learn and understand all sorts of inputs, we can tell the program what the decisions we have made based on the data the system gave us. And the program itself can start to learn why we made that decision, and can start to recommend future decisions, based on that knowledge.Eventually, the program will be able to recommend the same decisions a human would, except it will be able to calculate more variables, be able to make those decisions faster, and be able to optimize to a superhuman degree. This is when we hit Artificial Intelligence. A machine that does not help us make decisions. It makes them for us. When we reach this level, we will see a whole new level of job automation.We’ve seen this kind of thing before. Over the last century, manual labor has been steadily going to computers and robots over humans. They are cheaper, faster, more reliable, and don’t need vacation. Any job that is repetitive in nature has been in danger of being automated.But those of us in “thinking” jobs have felt safe. Those of us who make decisions, well, computers can’t take that! Right? AI is changing that. Actual artificial intelligence is coming that will automate thinking and decision making jobs. And when that happens, we are not ready.This is a scary future that most people on this planet do not actually think will happen. My team and I, though, are actively working on bringing this reality to life, and we are not the only ones. Today, I am going to walk you through what we are doing, so you can see the future like I do, and see how quickly it is coming for you.**Use Machines to make People Smarter**As I said, the first step towards getting rid of all of our jobs, is to make us better at our jobs using technology.At Swizzle, we focus on cognitive technology built around text analytics and natural language processing  Teaching computers how to read. The problem I solve is actually pretty simple. Companies today get TOO much customer feedback. Between emails, reviews, comments, forums, telephone conversations, blogs, and so much more, companies are buried in what their customers are saying. Inside of this feedback is incredibly valuable information, but there is way too much to read, so they are stuck.For example, we just helped a large bank. Their mobile app is ranked as one of the top 3 apps in the world, so you can imagine they get an insane number of app store reviews every day. Inside those reviews are bug reports, potential new product suggestions, marketing insights, PR problems, and so much more, but you can only read a small fraction of them. Using traditional text analytics solutions, like keyword analysis and sentiment analysis, they are able to see that some words have negative sentiment, but what does that really mean? Of course, a human could read the reviews and tell you what you should know and what you should do, but this kind of technology doesn’t dive deep like that, and a human can only read so much.Our solution is to use cognitive technology. Specifically, we created a system, called SIMON, that can learn what we are looking for, read for us, and tell us what we should know. The way it works is we pull all of the bank’s app store reviews and plug them into our Swizzle SIMON system. The system then identifies which reviews are the most important using algorithms we have made, and gives these reviews to a human, our data strategist.The data strategist then teaches the system why those reviews are important and what they mean. SIMON can now run calculations to learn why those reviews mean that, and take that knowledge and apply it to the rest of the reviews. When it finds new problems it doesn’t understand, it can work with the human who teaches it more. In the end, Swizzle’s system identifies, categorizes, and summarizes all of the important information that is inside the app store reviews, and gives it to the data strategist.It is really like a human working with a computer as a team.Now with this system, the data strategist knows everything he needs to know inside the reviews, and he has trained Swizzle SIMON to understand the reviews. For the bank, our data strategist understood exactly what they could do to make their app even better. He knew found who the bank’s customers think the biggest competitors are, and why. He uncovered buried testimonials where clients ranted and raved about how amazing the bank was. He knew what users really wanted to use the app for, and how the bank could help them. He knew every piece of important information inside the whole history of the app’s reviews as if he read and remembered every word.With this information our data strategist was able to talk to the bank, help them improve their product, and put together a report that summarized just what they needed to know. Using Swizzle’s SIMON, it was as if he downloaded all the reviews into his brain. Pretty cool, huh?**Use people to make computers smarter**So now the bank has a report and understands everything they need to know about their past reviews, but they still need a way to keep up to date on what people are saying in reviews every day. Just doing a report every few months is a quick way to stay out of touch with your customer.Thankfully, a side effect of using our system as a tool to help the data strategist is that the data strategist taught Swizzle how to truly understand what that bank’s customers are saying in app store reviews. And remember, the amazing thing about cognitive technology is that it can learn. We showed Swizzle’s SIMON what is important, why it is important, and what that particular bank’s customers mean when they leave a review. Now all we have to do is connect to the app store’s API and feed reviews into our system as they come in. Swizzle’s SIMON is now constantly reading reviews, analyzing them, and organizing them into what is important or not.Then, every week, SIMON creates a report of what is important to know, how previously identified problems are doing, and new information. This report is sent to our data strategist, who makes a decision as to what the bank needs to know, and trains Swizzle’s system further.To the bank, it is as if the data strategist is constantly just reading and remembering every review. It really is amazing, and keep in mind, this is not theoretical. This is what is happening right now. Today. The next step is where things get fun.**Artificial Intelligence**The next step on the path of us all losing our jobs is to move from Cognitive Technology to Artificial Intelligence.See, this whole time, the data strategist is not only training Swizzle’s SIMON to understand how to read these app store reviews, he is also training it how to interpret those reviews into important insights. Because this technology can learn, we can feed our client facing insights and recommendations into our system. SIMON can take this, and learn how a human interprets the data, and it tries to make those insights automatic. Feeding insights to our data strategist.Of course, these aren’t perfect yet, but soon, we will hit a point where the data strategist will not need to give our system feedback. Swizzle will run automatically and provide actionable insights of the same quality our data strategist does now.What’s more, you have to remember that this system is constantly reading reviews. It will be able to see the results of its recommendations, and learn how effective they are. Swizzle’s SIMON will be able to constantly find better and better recommendations as it continues.We can even train this system to know what teams need what information. If it finds a bug, it can tell the development team what they need to know to fix it. If it sees a PR problem, it can tell the PR team how to get ahead of it. If it notices a UX problem, a security alert, a product improvement idea, or anything, it can notify the right team, and give advice to take action on.Think about what this means. When we achieve this, there will be no need for anyone to read any app store reviews at that bank. There will be no need for anyone to look at any graphs, or analysis of keywords or sentiment. There won’t be a need for someone to interpret the results into something actionable. To communicate the customer’s will into actions. There won’t even be a need for customer surveys. The bank will have a system that does all of this, figures out what needs to be done, and then notifies the correct person on what they need to do.And remember, this is the step we are working on right now. This is happening today, not some distant future.**Automate Everything**Now let’s go even further and see how many jobs one AI can take.Instead of looking at just app store reviews, remember our product at Swizzle is to analyze all customer feedback. Let’s take emails, marketing engagements, comments, forums, blogs, survey data, telephone transcripts and more. Let’s put every means of communication our bank’s customers have through the same system we put app store reviews through.Swizzle’s artificial intelligence now takes in every piece of customer feedback available. Analyzes it. Categorizes it. Understands it, and builds actionable informative data from it. Swizzle uses this information to provide detailed recommendations on how to optimize your offerings, your messaging, your communications, and more. It can be asked detailed questions about your customers. Who they are, what they like, what they hate, what they want. Will they like this product or this? How should we approach them? Who are my competitors, etc.It can learn to identify PR disasters, before they happen, and help you get ahead of them. It can learn to identify new competitors or threats, recommend new products, or help you perfect your current products. It can do everything a human could, if that human was able to ingest EVERYTHING your customer says about you. Except it can do it for real, it can do it faster, it can do it better, and it can do it cheaper.When Swizzle’s AI can take in all customer feedback, it will have the capacity to replace human decision making in marketing research, customer analytics, product development research, parts of customer service, and more. You will now have a singular, intelligent entity that will take over listening to your customers, and recommend what you should do.The next step is team Swizzle up with all the other AI’s.**Who else is building AI?**Because, remember, this path I took you down is the path of one company. It is what we are working on, and it started with us just trying to make app store reviews more useful.You know we are not the only one solving business problems with cognitive technology. Other companies around the world are working on technology to help businesses with business intelligence, marketing automation, product development, financials, and so, so much more. Every aspect of running a business is currently being taught to a computer somewhere in the world in hopes of making things easier and more efficient. And every one of those companies are pushing toward automation. And that is happening right now!**An intelligent company**They are all building AI’s that will perfectly optimize their section of business. And when they all succeed, how long will it take for someone (or something) to piece it all together? To take all of the different AI’s, make them communicate with one another, and make one, incredible company that does not need humans. It will be able to research new ideas, start new businesses, operate those businesses, and optimize them without any human.Every aspect of running a business is currently being taught to a computer somewhere in the world in hopes So you ask me, what is the future of AI and cognitive technology? It is beautiful, amazing, optimized to a whole new degree. And it has little place for humans.**My Advice**Does this scare you a bit? My advice? Find all the different companies out there that are automating various aspects of your business. Go out of your way to engage with them. Take some risks and try to find what parts of your business you can automate. Keep an open mind and try to trust technology more. If you get ahead of this, you'll lead the way. If you try to follow, you might never catch up...";How would it be able to research new ideas? It can't physically do something, it would still rely on humans#I think those are two different things, but we can tackle them. The idea of marketing research is to try to understand what your consumers think of a product or advertisement, and use that information to improve your product or messaging. You used to only be able to get this info from surveys and panels, but now you can get it directly from what people say online in comments, reviews, emails, blogs, forums, online communities (like this one) and more. This information can certainly be crawled and read by an AI, and we have personally found this information to be more valuable than traditional marketing research, because it doesn't suffer from survey bias and other problems. So an AI can definitely research new ideas. To your other point, a program can definitely do physical things. It's called a robot.  :)

I realize that my disenchantment was more likely related to the job environment itself so I think a little time off has helped. With that being said, I am wondering if anyone here has made a move from networking to other related fields, like development, or big data, or DevOps, or some other technical field.

I was outsourced out of my previous job - NAS data storage - and was having no luck finding a job in that field. I heard about Big Data and was intrigued but I'm starting to wonder if it's doable without a university degree.I took a Big Data Developer course from Simplilearn and I think I kind of got burned. They did an ok job of teaching the basics and the overall concepts but I still don't know what I feel I need to know about processing and sorting data, whether through Hadoop or Spark. My only programming background is being halfway through a book on Python and I feel like if I'm going to get anywhere with Spark/Hadoop I would need something that's very ""this command does this"", hands-on kind of training.There's a local company called ""We Cloud Data"" that offers courses:http://weclouddata.com/courses/They have an info session on Saturday that I intend to check out, but I question whether a proficiency in Big Data can be taught in 12 courses.I'm more than willing to do basic entry level work in the field while I gather more training. I'm just wondering if this is really realistic or not. Any thoughts?";If you have a solid amount saved in the bank (you can also get student loans for this) you can put down on a coding bootcamp 12 week intensive program for data science...it will help show you the doors. Otherwise start making analytics apps in python (very much the language of data science), and slowly start applying to entry level jobs in your city. You will break through.#That's good to know, thank you.

What is the best path for me in terms of building a career . Data engineer or Data scientist(possible to become one without a degree?);Data Science will require you to have an in-depth knowledge of statistical algorithms that can help make decisions about data.  You will have some pretty high expectations put on you to know how to provide actionable insights on data and prove that your work is worthy of basing company decisions on.  Re: degree, I see mostly masters/PhD in this role unless its a small company.Data Engineering will be more about systems, infrastructure, and data discovery.  You will be building and using systems that massage data for Data Scientists and your business to use in making decisions.So basically, do you want to be a scientist or an engineer? Looking into the original definitions of these career paths can help you understand the difference between these two roles.Here's a great venn diagram showing some of the skills you might need.  https://s3.amazonaws.com/external_clips/attachments/35309/original/data-scientist-vs-data-engineer.jpg?1417662433Take everything with a grain of salt as these roles are still developing.

investing;6dxf0o;1496020854.0;/r/investing/comments/6dxf0o/big_data_as_the_next_battleground_for_investing/;Big data as the next battleground for investing;"The following is an article from BI. Anyone else knowledgeable on the subject? (See original article for some coinciding charts: From here: http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-the-future-of-investing-and-you-probably-cant-afford-it-2017-5)Big money investors have always sought an edge. Everything from star traders to fast computers to unique analysis can give a big hedge fund an advantage over competitors. The latest battleground is data.Investors are vying for new data sets that their competitors don't have, or haven't thought of using. These can range from the basic credit-card sales information to satellite data that tracks shipping routes, and parsing this kind of data for trading signals has been called ""the future of investing.""The industry providing this to the funds has sprung up amid an explosion in obtainable data over the past decade. The bad news for the regular investor: the cost of data, and the complexity associated with turning it into investment insights, means it will probably only be available to the biggest and most sophisticated funds. At JPMorgan's macro quantitative and derivatives conference on May 19, the bank surveyed 237 investors, and asked them about Big Data and Machine Learning. It found that 70% thought that the importance of these tools will gradually grow for all investors. A further 23% said they expected a revolution, with rapid changes to the investment landscape. ""There was widespread agreement that Big Data and Machine Learning is transforming the investment landscape across different trading frequencies, with more than 80% of participants expecting a reduction in relevance of traditional data sources,"" JPMorgan said in a note. To be specific, 52% of investors felt big data was already rendering traditional data sources (like financial statements and economic releases) ineffective. In other words, the quarterly reports that many regular investors rely on are already becoming less relevant. The rise of so-called alternative data has created a cottage industry of firms that source, process and consult on various data sources. The market for this data is expected to double in the next five years in the US, from $200 million today to $400 million, according to a recent TABB Group report.More than half (51%) of investors surveyed said they expected to buy semi-processed data, while 29% said they wanted to fully process in-house by consuming raw data. Respondents to the survey were particularly interested in credit card and transactional data. Investors are able to use anonymous data gleaned from credit card statements, and the rise of online shopping, and the digital receipts we get in our email, is a also boon. That's because emailed receipts are usually itemized, giving investors greater detail into what people are buying.The biggest impediment? Cost. While a lack of expertise and management buy-in were cited by respondents as challenges, the most frequently cited impediment was high-fixed costs.That finding is striking, given JPMorgan's event attracted big money investors like BlackRock and AQR, with sizeable budgets to spend on the data, expertise and processing power.If they find it expensive, the regular investor has no chance. ";Regular investors don't have to compete for big data. It's fairly asinine to conflate institutional investors with private investors. We don't have to worry about the market cap of companies, or the way in which our investments will impact their share price. We also don't have clients to please or regulations to conform to. In short, we actually have a number of advantages, despite the big-data and quant analysis institutions have. #All very true. However, there are many mutual funds and hedge funds specializing in microcap stocks these days (several hundred) so even those segments have become more competitive.

statistics;6ejz90;1496285673.0;/r/statistics/comments/6ejz90/is_it_possible_to_selfteach_yourself_statistics/;Is it possible to self-teach yourself statistics?;"I'm a biochemistry major, statistics/biomathematics minor, and I'll be finishing up my undergrad career next year. Over the past few years I've been reading about all of the really cool research that's being done with applied statistics and bio stats, and I've made it a personal goal to pursue an MD/PhD to interrelate medicine and research. I've been subscribed to this page for a while, and from reading some of these posts and trying to understand other aspects of statistics, I'm coming to realize that I don't know much at all. I'm really passionate and excited about the study, and I find myself reading ""trendy"" articles in data science, predictive analysis, and big data all the time, but it's not really helping me understand the meat and bones of statistics. I have a relatively weak math background, which I've been attempting to strengthen. Next semester I plan on taking linear algebra and an introductory computer science class. But I haven't taken a single theoretical class yet, and the only experience with statistics I have is the research I do in my lab, coding with R and STATA, and a couple of applied statistics classes where we learned about different tests. I guess my question is whether or not it's possible to learn some of this stuff on my own. If so, where do I start? Thanks!";It's certainly possible, indeed I have seen someone do it to a larger extent than I would have expected (though it took some pretty solid dedication). One thing that person did was *answer* a lot of questions on stats.stackexchange.com (also asked a few, but it was in the answering that you could really see the improvement).I suggest finding some problems you can't quite do ... and set out to understand and solve them. Preferably practical ones whose solutions you care about. #Yes, look on Coursera, edx, or ocw for an introductory course.#I did it myself (long ago).  Never had a statistics class until graduate school in statistics.But if your math is weak, in particular if your calculus is weak, you won't understand theoretical statistics.  If you cannot read a theoretical statistics book or the level of De Groot and Schervish or Casella and Berger or something of the sort, you will always have big gaps in your understanding.OTOH you don't' have to know all that much calculus to understand these books.  So you could give it a try.  When you get stuck, then you might switch to teaching yourself enough calculus to get past the sticking point in the statistics book.#Of course you can, it just won't be as good as someone who had years of training in a related discipline that comes from a higher degree. But lucky for you that is an option you still have, just put the PhD focus of your MD/PhD program in biostats. It's only after you *leave* school that it becomes not possible.#+1 for recommending the Cross Validated forum - it helped me immensely on the path to self-learn statistics, particularly for the possibility to ask the *'why they do it like this?'* questions.   However, I wouldn't recommend starting from practical problems. Knowing how to do a t-test won't help you derive the Fisher's test. I also don't think linear algebra and CS are important *in the beginning*. I think the standard biomed education mostly lacks in probability theory - and I don't blame people for finding balls in urns somewhat boring, but that is the basis for all subsequent statistics, so I would start there.#Is an understanding of calculus really that fundamental to statistics? I've taken Calc I and II, but haven't taken III yet, which covers double integration. I was thinking I'd want to focus on applied statistics, like clinical trials and data analysis. Is an understanding of theory important here as well?#Any probability distribution that has an infinite sample space needs calculus to do theory about it.  And if you are going to do statistics involving more than one random variable or more than one parameter, you are going to need multivariable calculus, but you don't need that much.  You do need to understand the multivariable change-of-variable theorem for integration (Jacobians) and partial derivatives.  But that's about it.  So I would think you could read a theory book without having to learn much new calculus.

I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the product so it will make a little bit more sense.  So we are going to go through this huge rebranding that will be revealed next week in Vegas to the public. Long story short- We used to be a private company called cheetahmail before we were bought out by a huge company called Experian. I am sure some of you have heard of this company before.  We were purchased officially (publicly announced) by a private equity company called vector capital who invests in a ton of tech companies worth billions. They have bought us at 600 million valuation which is hugely undervalued according to ""our management team"".   Our biggest competitor is Salesforce's Exact target whose cofounder interestly enough became our chairman after this purchase.  I was thinking about using this in the pitch because well that is our number 1 competitor. The other 3 big competitors is Oracle's responsys and IBM's Silverpop, and sometimes we run into Epsilon and Zeta depending on which region of the country we are competing in.  But anyways the reason why I am bringing this up is because was thinking about doing a campaign against Exact target which really is also one of the biggest opportunities because I will mention that their cofounder is our chairman now and of our biggest value props is that we are consistently ranked the highest by Gartner, Forrester and analysts to be the best service and support in the industry. And quite Frankly… their service sucks. They actually outsource their service. Which is huge in today’s age where everyone is fed up with outsourced service providers especially when you are paying millions in ACV.  Some of the other big differentiators are extreme segmentation and data driven approach plus ease of use meaning you do not need to be technical to use our drag and drop feature compared to our competitors who most likely you would need to know sql and other technical knowledge. The have to leverage their big data people to be able to use our competitors tools and ours you don’t. (Great selling point that I happen to forget to leave out in the moment sometimes). Maybe I just don’t know when to bring this up especially during the first call? Some of the challenges that I come across is when they say they are happy with what they are currently using. For instance, I have noticed when companies have Epsilon or Responsys(Oracle marketing cloud). It is harder for me to dig deeper.  Either than Data.com do you guys know of any free ways to get direct dials.  A strategy that has been serving me well lately is just really becoming good friends with the executive assistants to help me get my message across. I have been able to secure a lot of meetings trying to befriend them instead of trying to wiggle my way past the gatekeeper.  What are your thoughts on this? I kind of just answered my own question just reflecting and writing this post. That I needed to challenge them more and actually dig deeper and not be satisfied with just “I am happy where I am with my vendor relationship so far.” When you get that answer, what do you guys push without seemingly pushy?  I have noticed one of my strengths being able to write quality notes and “sometimes” ask the hard questions that give me the answers I need being who the right decision maker is, what is their timeline? Being that the average sales cycle for us is 6 months to a year. The average contract is anyway over a 1million dollars to 5 million on the deals I am helping out with. Average contract is 3 years long. Some others questions I have are.  What other creative approaches would you recommend for breaking into companies like P&G, General Mills, and Kimberly Clark. I have a lot of success with straight up like grinding and being super persistent but I have found that it tough to hit KPIs aka huge call volume expectations if I want to be personal and use relevant case studies per level (C levels, VPs, Directors, Manager, specialist, etc) I know these are a lot of hard questions but would appreciate any support around this.   Some of the ideas I have had are write out handwritten notes to decision makers and/or champions that have helped me in anyway. Just to stay top of mind.  Has anyone tried sending video emails? How has that worked for you?";I would recommend focusing slightly more on benefits over features. They won't care about who your chairman is, what publication ranks you higher, or what tech you use, they only care about how you can improve their lives. Can you save them money, time, get better results? If so, use proof points and current customers that are their competitors and hammer those points home! #Do you have insight at the contact level if they are using these technologies?EpsilonResponsysZetaExact Target ?Or are you just guessing? I work for a company that can help. #What does your company do?#yeah we use E data source. What company are you guys? #Track technology.

(and other pet peeves)";"I'm not saying that I'm not grateful for all the predecessors in the past who paved the way but the buzzword usage of ""big data"" in mixed-background corporate boardrooms is so hackneyed and overused nowadays that it's a deprivation of any intent to properly define what they are actually talking about....they treat it like a black box and somehow the genie works....aka statistics and algorithmsAll the salespeople and business negotiators who know how to use rudimentary Excel pivot tables and SQL think that their 'loose definition' of big data allows them to smear this buzzword in every crevice of their conversation, proposal titles, and presentations just to sound smart in front of the uninformed. Big data is a misnomer tacked on to everything for it to seem more je ne sais quoi than what it actually is.I mean, it's cool because they are educating themselves on the new trends but after a while, it gets so old and unimaginative...if it's a data frame with 1 million rows just be humble and call it a data frame already...if it's anything less and you can open the file on excel without it lagging for 2 minutes, the data is not big enough to qualify -- that's the rule of thumb.If you are practicing the discipline among peers, you don't dare utter that term unless you want to be the laughing stock...the term 'data science' in the future will also fall into this category...just call things predictive analytics or bayesian machine learning or the precise term for what you are doing already. if it's a tuple, call it a tuple already..having something be called a 'data dump' is much more refreshing than it being called 'big data' -- on the condition that data dump is the accurate definition of what is depicted.You gotta use more precise terms instead of a bloated conglomerate term that could mean everything and anything that could qualitatively be described as ""big"" and any 'thing' that could be broken down as ""data""...in the same vein, any hard discipline could be classified as a ""science,"" which would also make the term ""data science"" obsolete as well because a lot of disciplines are sciences and they generate data....All these candy conferences with 'big data' in their title are there to introduce the topic to the layman or to the businessmen with investment money trying to upscale and sigma six their business. It's a double edged sword because machine learning, algorithms, and automation will lay off half their staff. The people whose jobs are in jeopardy would rather turn away from the technology and do busy-work for the rest of their lives instead of retraining for industryI have a pet peeve with corporations refusing/neglecting to implement some of this machine learning, algorithms, and automation correctly to their business model while adapting to the times...programming needs to be taught in school and treated as importantly as studying a foreign language. MBAs need coding classes to get their feet wet into the business world of tomorrow..data analytics is a start...I also have a pet peeve with too many companies trying to save money by hiring no-name consulting companies-who-claim-what-they-know-what-they-are-doing but fall sub par with industrial standards to the point that the progress never develops and these money-conscious companies subsequently shy away from hiring true talent or established companies that could upgrade them properly because they are afraid to put value and invest in the future.Some conservative companies actively try to suppress this technology due to their ""higher morals"" when the money that the company can save can pay off their severance packages...not to mention that you and I are both wasting our adult lives at work doing the mindless tasks that could be automated..it's hard to let go but do you want to be a pencil pusher for the rest of your career? time is money and we're wasting both. Time to retrain for industry and do something worthwhile that has greater impact and brings higher sense of self  something that you always wanted to do while sustaining your bottom line...because after all, life is too short";It's gotten to the point that it's more like a joke between me and my only data-sciency work colleague, or cringy when I listen to other people using it seriously and out-of-place#Yep, big data is too often being used like you used je ne sais quoi, to appear educated in front of everyone else ^^#Yes. #Haha!

datascience;6d0m9t;1495610320.0;/r/datascience/comments/6d0m9t/which_query_language_and_knowledge_carries_more/;Which query language and knowledge carries more importance in Data Science: Relational Databases or NoSQL DB's ?;I am already familiar with ORACLE SQL due to my work, and have been recently learning Cassandra DB and CQL(again, learning it for work).I was just curious to know as to which one carries more emphasis when we look at it from a data science​ perspective. I know that once we go into the field of Big Data, NoSQL DB's are the way to go, but still I have this small inkling of doubt. Should I invest more energy into learning Cassandra if I want a future in Data Science, or should I improve my skills in Oracle? Also as a bonus, could someone elaborate on the skill set required for a data scientist/analyst from either of those? For example: I know all about querying  and creating various DDL and DML queries in Oracle. I have also started some courses recently to learn SQL tuning(out of self-interest). Would these skills be enough to sustain myself in the future when I move into data science field ? Thanks in advance for your replies !!;Understanding set theory is probably never going to hurt (aside from the suffering incurred on the journey to understanding). The shape/structure in which the data is stored will necessitate focusing on different query strategies, but many of the key concepts remain. Basically, I don't really see it as a binary choice. You're likely going to work with both. Optimize your study for what you specifically want to do, that is the stack a target employer uses. Otherwise you may be engaging in premature optimization. Or just ignore this comment because I model software first, data second.#Have little experience with NoSQL myself, so from my frog-perspective ...- A lot of the big data applications are based on or closely related to the SQL stack (e.g. ETL). Databases will also remain the preferable solution to store structured data for the foreseeable future, meaning they will remain the source for many datasets.This also points to one of it's prime limitations: it's not able to handle unstructured data very well (text, images, video, etc).- Not every problem can be handled efficiently using SQL, wouldn't want to do text analyses or a logistic regression in it. It has limited maths build in and will require c additions to perform complex calculations.Generally, i would say SQL can be used for retrieving input & storing output, but will barely allow analyses (compare how much times it takes to study a dataset in pure SQL compared with a regular Excel pivot). I don't know if the same applies to NoSQL#> compare how much times it takes to study a dataset in pure SQL compared with a regular Excel pivotAn RDBMS can handle datasets that can't fit in Excel. Also, some RDBMSs have a `PIVOT` command (SQL Server comes to mind), and (in my experience) pivot tables can usually be replaced with aggregations in SQL without too much trouble.#When connecting Power Pivot (add-on, upgraded version of regular excel pivot), and load your data from SQL, you are only limited by your RAM. A notebook can handle datasets with 100M rows. This should be enough for most test analyses. (Just mind the network load)I know it's possible to pivot and aggregate in SQL, but it takes lotta code to perform different slice & dices. Where you can perform say 10 in 1 minute on a cube, doing the equivalent in SQL takes much longer. SQL allows it, but is not a medium well suited for data-discovery.(& Love how for SQL pivot() you have to explicitily define which column headers to include, never mind if the underlying data changes)#> I know it's possible to pivot and aggregate in SQL, but it takes lotta code to perform different slice & dices.

Pick or include any that apply.** - 2-in-1 sounds nice (article annotations, presentation figures), but not worth breaking the bank over, I think- 2hr battery life at least- Solid specs for science PhD studies, expected use:        ~ R analyses and Excel (with several thousand entries, but not true ""big data"")       ~ Firefox, Adobe Acrobat sometimes with up to around 20-35 papers/websites open       ~ Inkscape, Powerpoint for presentation and figure making       ~ Image-J for lightweight image analyses, maybe.       ~ Doing all this stuff across two monitors       ~ 250GB storage minimum. 750GB+ would be best. SSD if the price point is right, otherwise keeping it classic is okay.- Normal life stuff, Netflix, music, Word/LaTeX* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**<5lb would be great, will be carrying it everyday to/from campus and cafes* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**Windows.* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** For a standard laptop, 14""-15"" sounds nice - or whatever I need for a ""full size"" keyboard, with number pad is optimal.For a 2-in-1, let's go smaller so I can cradle it comfortably while reading papers and sketching figures.* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Not much, gaming is just icing on the cake. If I can run Overwatch, Civ, Xcom, Witcher-III, HotS, that's a perk. But I may build a desktop someday to take care of that. Low priority.Otherwise, Inkscape/Photoshop and Image-J occasionally.* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** The aforementioned games on medium settings, 30+FPS would be ducky. Again, let's not sweat this much though.* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** - Full-size, or very nearly, keyboard, number pad is a bonus- 3+ USB ports, ethernet- SD reader (negotiable)- VGA and/or DVI- 250GB drive bare minimum, more is better- Webcam for skyping- Optical drive would be very nice, but not a total deal breaker- Sturdy enough to survive being carried in backpack 2+ times a day* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**I'll be buying this in July/Aug, so if a perfect fit is a wee bit over budget, please do recommend it and I can watch for a price drop in the next months.I can also buy in Germany, but I think comps are cheaper in the USA.Thank you!!";"Hi,It was very difficult to find something on your budget and specs, eventually I did get a few hits: [**noteb search results**](https://noteb.com/?search/search.php?advsearch=1&bdgminadv=420&bdgmaxadv=850&exchadv=USD&launchdatemin=2014&launchdatemax=2017&nrcoresmin=2&nrcoresmax=4&cputdpmin=2&cputdpmax=91&cpufreqmin=0.9&cpufreqmax=4.2&cputechmin=14&cputechmax=28&gputype=2&gpumemmin=64&gpumemmax=16384&gpubusmin=64&gpubusmax=512&gpupowermin=16&gpupowermax=330&gpulaunchdatemin=2013&gpulaunchdatemax=2017&displaymin=14&displaymax=15.6&verresmin=1080&verresmax=2160&DISPLAY_msc_id%5B%5D=LED%20IPS&capacitymin=310&capacitymax=4096&typehdd%5B%5D=SSD&nrhdd=1&mdbslots=0&MDB_port_id%5B%5D=1%20X%20LAN&mdbwwan=1&rammin=8&rammax=64&freqmin=1333&freqmax=2800&batlifemin=1.4&batlifemax=20&acumcapmin=23&acumcapmax=116&weightmin=0.7&weightmax=2.4&thicmin=8.4&thicmax=83.9&widthmin=208&widthmax=569&depthmin=170&depthmax=339&webmin=0.92&webmax=5&wnetspeed=150&oddtype=Any%2FNone&opsist%5B%5D=Windows%2010%20Home&yearsmin=1&yearsmax=5).

The electoral commission can't regulate how much you spend as long as you do it outside of 'regulated times' which are generally just a couple months a year. The long con. Fuck just trying to cram it all into 2 months before the election. A sustained 'Tories are shite' narrative in the faces of Tory voters in marginals, for 5 solid years.. I ran a few tests. It's not even *that* expensive. About £300 a month per constituency with some decent targeting gets your articles seen by a good few thousand a day. Enough to win a marginal. You can even target daily mail readers specifically, lmao. Push any anti-Tory articles a daily mail publish directly into daily mail readers facebook newsfeeds. #If you had enough money to do that you wouldn't be wanting the tories to lose.#Crowdsource it. #Some people did in one constituency. The conservatives outbid them.

startups;6cz67v;1495590718.0;/r/startups/comments/6cz67v/mysql_database_backbone_has_facebook_reduced_the/;MySQL database backbone: Has Facebook reduced the cost of scaling?;"Hello r/startups! It has taken me way too long to find this sub, so this first post will be both my introduction and my first questions!Here's where I'm at: I'm designing a mobile app/web platform which will be data-based, and rely heavily on relational database structures. *The first decision* I made on my own: starting out, I'm going to keep the data in-house and run the backend myself. The issue here is **data** is the core value of the company  the 'technology' being developed for this can easily be replicated by anybody else who understands RDB's. Utilizing hosting providers and cloud services like AWS and Azure sounded good at first, but not when they might become competitors in the future. Why would I want my company's most valuable asset sitting on another company's servers?**Now the real question:** What kind of technology do I build it on? The top 3 picks for RDB's are Oracle, MS SQL, and MySQL. The first two have awesome technology, but means being locked into a proprietary system for all of eternity. **Pros:** rest assured, the tech will scale up big and fast. **Cons:** eternally beholden to another company's whims, price gouges, and fuck-ups. Then there's the open-source option, **MySQL.** Now this seems *appealing* for many reasons, namely the technology is so good now that the differences between Oracle vs. MySQL and MS SQL vs. MySQL are minimal, save a few special features. OSS also means free as in beer, forever with no contract, and access to the [source code](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server) for custom changes. It sounds perfect, right? I've been thinking of the biggest **pitfalls** of this option. First the obvious ones, OSS means practically no support  if something breaks, you have to rely on your team to get it running again. This means hiring developers of the core RDBMS to keep the bugs under control within a timely manner. Second is ownership. I'm no expert on licenses, but as I understand it, all these contributions from the developers you pay also become OSS for everybody else as well. (These two things I'm honestly not too worried about, like I said before the value of this company will mostly be the data, not the technology it's built on.)However there's one final concern: **MySQL and scalability.** I've heard Facebook has gone through nightmares to scale MySQL up to Facebook size with the performance they have. Something to do with the core tech of SQL itself never foresaw the ""big data"" revolution requiring clusters of hundreds of servers to host one database, thus requiring you to ""shard"" the MySQL over several servers.That sounds really sloppy and difficult to work with, but is it? Is it really? After all, this is how Facebook operates today, and [they've put more work into MySQL](https://github.com/facebook/mysql-5.6) than anybody else. It may sound sloppy in theory, but if they've refined it in practice and it works well, who cares? After all, the only alternatives are **Oracle** or **MS SQL.**What do you guys think? Is MySQL still the best choice for a kinda-Facebook-alike data company? Or do you think if their devs were here today and could build it new again from scratch, they would choose a different technology?Thank you braving through a long-winded post! Cheers!";"When I did consulting, I would respond to these questions with simple ""Tell me why Postgres won't work?"". MySQL is pretty anemic compared to PostgreSQL.The most important factors in choosing a database is understanding how your data model will behave. FB was able to scale MySQL because they implemented a flat table structure with single line inserts and selects (avoiding joins). But that's only relevant when you have to start sharding indexes, which isn't that important at this point. FB also had unique growing pains around other data issues and made large advancements in handling graph queries, analytic databases, and projects like Cassandra.I can't agree that Oracle, MSSQL, and MySQL are on equal footing technically  I see them as very different beasts. At the minimum each has unique aspects of their SQL syntax.OSS does not mean 'no support', it means that support comes from companies that don't own the license. Cloudera just IPO'd, and their entire business model is providing support for Hadoop. Most likely, you are not going to be contributing to the core projects of any open source DB. You'll be building your application on top of the DB. Creating a table in PGSQL doesn't count as contributing to PGSQL.In terms of competitors, I promise you that Amazon does not care about you. If they do want to compete with you, it will be far down the road. And if that's a concern, then use something like Softlayer, Digital Ocean, or Linode. I tend to believe that startups should focus on building the things that don't exist, not focusing on solved problems.#>After all, the only alternatives are Oracle or MS SQL.Never heard of Postgres?Also Facebook is now operating over way more than just MySQL, they didn't create Cassandra for now reason.#you're worrying about problems you don't have or may never have.  Come back down to reality.  Host on Aurora and focus on your product and customer acquisition.  If you get big enough migrate off#Tech stacks involve a lot of personal opinion. For every person who insists MySQL is a great move, someone will tell you it's a terrible move.You need to take everything with a grain of salt as no one is objectively better.The one thing I feel you could objectively state is, Oracle is an objectively bad move for a startup. I say this as someone who has done a lot of Oracle consultations: The target of the product has always been large financial and legal firms. It's entirely possible you multiple millions of dollars worth of funds to burn, but if you don't, my sales contacts aren't interested in being referred to you.#Thank you for such a quick an excellent reply, this will take some time to digest.I am still designing the database model, but I can already tell it will require a lot of joins. Also one giant self-referential list (item 1, sub-item 1, sub-sub-item 1) which will require specific queries for views, and a lot of 'summary' or 'count' operations (e.g. Item 1 has 3 child-items, 2 of which have their own child-items (folder), and has 16 links. Item 2 has 8 child-items...)Also I think you're absolutely correct about not developing the OSS. It would take too many resources, and detract from the focus. I am interested in hosting services, yet I have heard that if you build your platform in AWS, it's very difficult to 'get it out' later on if you decide to. Is this true, or am I worrying too much about this without having the scale yet? My platform will also incorporate a LOT of integrations with other services, cloud-based and corporate-hosted resources. Also file-based imports and exports, and mobile device integrations. It's very ambitious but I want to build a solid core (the database!) connecting it all first, then add them in one at a time as we mature, like little automations.The plan is to finish a rough prototype in Microsoft Access then dogfood the shit out of it, prototype a mobile app, dogfood the shit out of it, invite friends and family to eat my dogfood, then pitch it, development it up and prepare for launch. I'm trying to test the core theory behind my platform to ensure it works in the real world, and that it will be relatable to others.When I first was researching the difference between PostgreSQL and MySQL I think I saw something that made me think MySQL would fit my model better. I will have to go back and research Postgre more. I'm debating whether to start writing SQL, php and JavaScript now, or to keep using easy development tools for easy iterations.I'm still in the design phase, in my mind what I want is so clear but describing it on paper I still get stuck. There's not many people I can talk to in this level of detail about it, so this discourse helps clarify my direction a bit. Thanks! #There will be no customer acquisition phase until we're ready to launch. :)This will be a free service. I guess I screwed the pooch by not stating that outright. Sorry guys.Our main commodity will be data, there will be other monetization paths later on but the value of this type of data only grows when there's more and more people using it. The plan is to scale up *quick,* which is why I'm being particular about scalable platforms. My fear is we're really just designing a data model for connecting disparate information, in a way that I think hasn't been done before. Growing too slowly would give too much opportunity to big players, like Google Docs and Gmail, to leverage their large development teams and build the same integrations within their own platforms.So yep, this is another no-profit popularity-based pitch, so I may be overthinking it a bit because I plan to overthink it for a decent chance of success.I still have no idea what I'm doing. Hence why I'm here. :)#> yet I have heard that if you build your platform in AWS, it's very difficult to 'get it out' later on if you decide to. Is this trueIt depends on what you mean.If you build on EC2, their virtual server product, you've built something that theoretically can run on any Linux server. You could pack up and move to Linode tomorrow.Where it becomes a different story is when you build workflows around specific products like AWS Lambda, which don't currently have effective replacements with other providers."

Natural, considering they make a living from it. When starting on DWH project, i used both. Kimbal made me think the sky is the limit. The redbook gave me a more balanced view of trade offs between large & limited scope DWHing. #And available on safari. Awesome. Thanks, I'll check it out. #Sure thing.

IWantOut;6dp2b4;1495908143.0;/r/IWantOut/comments/6dp2b4/us_academicuniversity_employment/;US -> ?. Academic/university employment?;Hi all,I'm interested in leaving the US once I finish my PhD. I have a few friends that have gone to Europe for post-docs, but all returned to the US for faculty/professor jobs. If possible, I'd like to stay abroad. I apologize if this field might be a little unusual for this sub, but I have a couple of years left till I get my degree and anything I can start doing as far as preparation, experience, or contacts, I'd like to get a head start!I really only speak English, but I'm told that's OK because often classes are taught in English in many countries (true?). My degree will give me skills in molecular biology, wildlife biology, conservation, and computing/big data.I was thinking of looking somewhere in northern Europe, and I know that I would be very limited by what universities are hiring for positions I can fill, but I'm curious if people here know countries anywhere that might be notably easier or harder to get a job (long-term) in a university/research capacity.Thanks!;"At the masters level stuff is usually in English, but at the undergrad level it's generally in the local language. For academia, if they want you, visas aren't going to be an issue. Last time I was in Germany I knew plenty of post docs who didn't know enough to teach in German. I don't think post docs generally teach?#I left the US for a postdoc in Denmark and I'm still here working almost 5 years later in a permanent position.  So this is possible - most people go back to the US because if you actually want a faculty position, it's a hell of a lot easier in the US than over here (and you'd also have to speak the local language fluently to teach).  And if you're thinking ""well it's not easy in the US""...well then there you go - it's even worse here. Plus the pay for PhD-level positions in industry is better in the US than over here.  The only reason I'm still here is because my husband, who is a citizen of another EU country, is doing a PhD and it may be the easiest place for both of us to remain employed in the same place for the time being.  There are some English-language courses but in most countries in northern/western Europe, they are required by law in most public programs to hold undergraduate courses in the local language.  In Denmark at least 95% of them are in Danish and as you can imagine, that means the majority of the faculty positions that require teaching will require fluency in Danish (and good luck getting fluent in Danish while doing a postdoc).  What few may exist somewhere that don't require it - well you can imagine that the competition for these is even greater, as there are a ton of foreigners doing postdocs in all these countries, and everyone speaks English - both locals and foreigners alike.  I've known a handful of professors who were recruited here without speaking Danish, and they were required to learn it within a short time, but these professors were senior people with decades of experience.  They don't hire any fresh assistant professors who don't already speak Danish.#For a post-doc level you should be fine with English only. For faculty positions, they typically ask that you speak the local language within a few years, as teaching (bachelors) is almost always in the local language.Western/northern Europe is hard for faculty positions, as the competition is killing, but again, will depend strongly on the field.The best thing you can do for now as preparation is network abroad. Go to all possible conferences, give talks, socialise with everybody that runs a group etc."

Have a question about GPU. Is RX580 worth it over RX570? I have almost identical built. Difference is RAM (went for Corsair 3200) and now cant make a decision witch AMD GPU to get (as I am intending to use linux). Why did you go with 2 different monitors? #Most recommend 2666mhz RAM with Ryzen, it's what I've gone for as you can't reach 3200 with it. #I chose the RX 580 to just future proof myself, the 570 is relatively the same price as a 580 in Canada. Additionally, ive chosen multiple monitors to watch prices, but I think I'm settling on the lg 29um68 ultra wide, 2560x1080p, freesync and can be Ocd to 80hz#Thank you,changed my order as 3200 is extra 20 pounds. Still not sure. Will you ever get 3200 on ryzen or thats the limit? #From my understanding 3200 is capped on some mobos. People are mentioning toying with the BIOS frequency can achieve 3200. Imho, I believe as more Bios updates comes out, they will allow ram to run at 3200 rather than tweaking the settings to allow that. Make sure you look for ram compatible with your motherboard to take full advantage of the speeds
careerguidance;6frnzn;1496816240.0;/r/careerguidance/comments/6frnzn/does_it_make_sense_for_me_to_go_back_to_school_to/;Does it make sense for me to go back to school to study data science?;Hi everyone, thanks for taking a moment to give some advice. I graduated at 22 with a degree in economics. I spent 2 years trying to become a teacher but decided it wasn't for me. I've spent the last 5 years of my life floating around between jobs, not sure of my long-term career goals. I've been a travel agent, sold advertising, done mental health support, never more than 7 months before my current job. I've been working for a major insurance company as a sales agent in the after hours center. The pay is great, the hours are very flexible and I like the people, but I find the work to be pretty dull and repetitive. Despite this, I'm performing well and successful at selling. I'm looking for a career more suited to my analytical, problem solving mindset. I love working through problems and I'm fascinated with big data and potentially working in technology. I have been reading into the career field of Data Science and I find it to be really interesting. My company offers education reimbursement of $6,000 per year. The problem is that I have no experience with programming and minimal experience with data programs. How realistic is it to go back to school to get another degree? Is it worth it going into debt of between $10,000 to $30,000 and spending multiple more years in school? With a bachelor's, can I go straight to a master's or would a bachelor's be required? Are there opportunities to get mentoring or internship opportunities? Any recommended resources on education, job opportunities and general advice?;Head over to /r/datascience. The sub is absolutely inundated with posts by people in your position. I am a data scientist, so I feel moderately qualified to speak on this. Data scientists build data products. If you want to be an analyst, that will require less education. Unless you took a lot of math and stats in college, you aren't qualified to apply to any respectable graduate programs in economics. If you can find a respectable grad program that teaches you Hadoop, R, SQL, and Python _at a minimum_, then do your damnedest to get into that program. Otherwise, go for another bachelor'a degree. If you just want to be a data analyst, you should probably do a M.S. Business Analytics open to people of all majors. They're usually really good programs for who they're educating. You won't come out of it a stats wiz or programming god, but you'll have a degree and some marketable skills. But seriously, /r/datascience can elaborate. I'm just some jerk waiting for his oil change. Oh, and is it worth going into debt? I know data scientists who work in London, Paris, and Seattle. You can get a job in any major city. Zillow in Seattle pays entry-level data scientists anywhere from $100,000-$115,000 starting out. That is not uncommon in Seattle. So as long as you're serious, you will earn back any debt you take on in the first two years. #You don't normally need to get a second bachelor's to go into a master's program, even if the bachelor's is unrelated.  I don't know much about data science degrees, but I wanted to throw out there that you should look at graduate degrees in economics.  I have a few friends who got their PhDs in economics and it was basically a degree in applied statistics.  One of them got an analyst job at a health insurance company upon graduation.  So I think your Bachelor's in Economics might be an excellent background for that kind of thing.If you were a good student in undergrad, have a look at PhD programs.  A lot of PhD programs are free and you get a stipend for the 5 years you are a student.  It's not a lot, around $30,000 a year, but you don't accumulate any debt either.If you think a masters is better, go to a job site and search for MS in Data Science to find out what jobs require one.  If you don't see a lot of jobs that want it, or the jobs don't look interesting, then maybe it's not a great career move.
AustralianPolitics;6doiwg;1495901920.0;/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/6doiwg/how_productivity_commission_chief_peter_harris/;How Productivity Commission chief Peter Harris wants big data to work for us;[deleted];[deleted]#It quite clearly states they're talking about de-identified data, which is a legally definable term in Australia thanks to the Australian privacy principles. He also states that he wants to bring more transparency and control for the individual over the private data that organisations hold. Both of these things are measures that would _prevent_ a 1984. I'd suggest you read his proposal more carefully. #Was thinking the same thing. Seems like a step in the right direction. Giving power back to consumers. Of course with any policy like this it would have to be carefully checked but from a cursory glance it's a problem that needs to be addressed politically before corporate interests take hold. 
MBA;6doqfv;1495904393.0;/r/MBA/comments/6doqfv/profile_review_where_should_i_apply/;[Profile review] Where should i apply?;Hi r/MBA, at a point in my life where I'm thinking about going to get my MBA but not sure if I should and if the answer is yes, where to apply?**Background**Work experience: Spent 1 year doing AmeriCorps, 1 year doing data/analytics at a medical center, and 1 year (current) at MBB doing analytics consultingExtra curriculars: Mentor local high school kids, mentor college students nationallyUndergrad school/major: Top public school (think UCLA, UVA, UMich), science majorOther education/coursework: Masters in a science major at a private universityRace/nationality: Asian-AmericanSex: Male**Stats**GMAT Score (include breakdown!): Haven't taken yet but shooting for a 740-760Undergrad GPA: ~3.0 for both undergrad and masters**MBA Info**Goal of MBA: 1) to be able to work in roles for social sector/non-profit and 2) keep my doors open. I originally thought I wanted to go into medicine (either med school or research) and after my AmeriCorps year, I saw a much more interesting opportunity to pivot into big data/business analytics (in healthcare). To be completely honest, not sure if I should consider the MBA because of opportunity costs, but the notion has been on my mind for some time.Target schools: Top 5-10 schools, figured if I don't go for these schools then the returns are greatly diminished for me.EDIT: Also worth noting, been looking more into the MBA/MPP program offered by Harvard Kennedy and partner MBA programs (H/S/W/Sloan). I think right out of the MBA, I'm interested in getting involved in consulting or PE that are involved in social work.;I think if you can figure out a little better why you want to get an MBA then it will show you what schools are a good fit for you. Right now it seems like you are wishy-washy on the whole idea, and if that's the case an MBA might not be right for you. Plus adcoms can usually see through that.But if all I'm seeing is top 5-10 schools and social sector/non-profit I guess Yale is probably your school.#You've got a profile that's competitive for top 16 schools: good undergrad, name brand employers, good GMAT (assuming you can nail it). GPA isn't great, but it's only one factor.So apply to 2-3 M7 schools, and 2-3 top 16 ex M7 schools. Exactly which ones you apply to is up to personal preference#Hey man, HBS social enterprise type here-- I think you have the building blocks of a winning HSWB profile here, maybe this cycle or the next one. Honestly, I was also skeptical of the MBA and it's opportunity cost, but there is really no better vehicle for switching careers. The doors it opens are incredible and you can even start networking for the job after your post-MBA job while still in school. That's how much access you get and how eager employers are to talk to you. I think a top tier MBA is especially important for government and social sector people because it lets us switch out of those sectors later if we find they are not the right fit.In any event inner the success of your app will come down to narrative. If your comfortable sharing details DM me and I can give them a look.
AskDocs;6eqiet;1496357856.0;/r/AskDocs/comments/6eqiet/what_information_do_doctors_need_hypothetical/;What Information Do Doctors Need? (hypothetical);"Hi AskDocs, this is my first time visiting this sub, so bear with me if my question is best suited to another sub, is inane, or has been asked a million times already. I am an IT guy and tinkerer in general and have been pondering something nonstop for a few days now: Why aren't medical smart wearables a thing? This was the basis for an idea about developing a diagnostic/data collection wearable that could gather data 24 hours a day about a user, and then that data could be used by doctors to make better, more accurate diagnoses and give very granular long term data for predicting and avoiding future medical issues. Now for some follow up questions. First, what data sets would be useful for doctors to have that a wearable could collect? Heart rate minute by minute? Sleep schedule/quality? Blood pressure? Temperature? What non-invasive sensors exist that could be integrated into a wearable that I don't know about? Not being a medical professional, I am probably out of the loop on these sorts of things, so if there have been developments recently that haven't made it to an audience outside of the specialized fields in which they are researched and developed, what would be the best sources for information? Any other considerations or parameters that a doctor might think of that my economics degree and IT experience haven't primed me to think of? This idea is zygotic at this point, I have no means of constructing or developing a wearable of this caliber or function currently. This is just an idea that has been stuck in my brain for a few days now, and I can't help but think that it should be possible to leverage big data sets and advanced data analysis to help with diagnosis and prevention and that something should be feasible in a relatively unobtrusive device like a smartwatch or even a more feature rich ""constellation"" of devices (wristband, earbud, chest-band, brain activity sensor, eye tracker, maybe even an implanted or semi-implanted device of some kind?). Anyway, This is just the start and I'm sure I'll have more questions later but this can be the beginning of a conversation (that sounds like a u/PhillyDeFranco catchphrase). Thanks In advance to any that make it through this wall of text and any that respond! ";"You know what would be more useful?  An accurate Past MedicalHistory, including surgeries, allergies and said reaction to, and up-to-date listing of medications, dosage and frequency.  I wished I had a dollar for every time a patient told me ""oh, it's all in the computer"" and it is so NOT all in the computer.All of the visits to the neurologist, orthopedist, and that cardiologist in Columbus are not there.  Half the medications were bought from CVS and the other half mail order, those are hit and miss, especially if they came from different providers.I am imaging something that the patient carries around and is updated at every visit to the doctor, hospital, and pharmacy.Much more boring from an IT perspective, but so helpful. #You would need accurate senors and a way to convert them to accurate values and that they be small enough to wear.  Look at fitness wearables and their innacuracy.  If the sensors were available, I could see products using them and reported to your doctor.#Amen#They have this- its a USB Drive. But, hospital will not let us plug it in (network security concerns)#That's why it would have to be something other than a simple jump drive.  It would have to be encrypted, durable, and easy to carry around like a credit card. Edit - It also would have to be very easy to update, like with a swip."

Both courses will be similar (both sound useless for employment prospects, frankly) and I'd discourage you from both unless you want to do a PhD after. Also, I'd recommend an MRes rather than an MSc. If you're hellbent on the MSc, I would look at how long the 40-credit project is and how long you would have to work on the project is.At both of those universities, the MSc students will be seen as a burden and the real researchers will avoid them as they'd be a distraction compared to real research produced by the PhD students.#> The fact is that MSc courses are not important for those universities except in terms of income.Yup, this, OP.  Be aware that masters programs in the UK are nothing like in Canada.  #[deleted]#The normal research masters in Canada is designed to be more of a mini-PhD  it's longer than the UK one and (in my experience) has higher expected research outcomes.  Obviously the details will vary by field and place a bit, but my experience (masters in a STEM subject in Canada) was that: * the masters students were paid a stipend to be there, rather than paying tuition.  It was also common to be the teaching assistant for some courses to earn extra money and experience.* admissions was competitive and based on having a supervisor agree to supervise your thesis work (and pay your stipend, unless you had a scholarship).  It was not a departmental decision to let you into a ""program"" as such.* the minimum length was two years  about 20 months worth of that time was work on a single research project* you were expected to be able to write and publish at least one journal article based on your work by the end (not everybody did, depending on their future interests, but the majority did and some had two papers out of it)I'm not sure what the equivalent of a Canadian masters is in the UK  I'd say it falls somewhere between an MRes and a PhD in the UK."

Here we will look at what is required to get started with Big Data and the rational behind it.There are a lot of information on the internet to get started with each one of them and it is easy to get lost. So, the references to get started with those technologies are also included.**Linux** : Big Data (the Hadoop revolution) started on the Linux OS. Even now most of the Big Data software’s are initially developed on Linux and porting to Windows has been an after thought.Microsoft partnered with Hortonworks to speed up the porting of the Big Data software’s to Windows.To get started with the latest software’s around Big Data, knowledge of Linux is a must. The good thing about Linux is that it is free and it opens up a lot of opportunities.There are more than 100 different flavors of Linux and Ubuntu is one of the popular distribution to get started for those who are new to Linux.**Java** : Most of the Big Data software’s are developed in Java. I say most, exceptions are Spark has been developed in Scala, Impala has been developed in C/C++ and so on.To extend the Big Data software’s knowledge of Java is a must. Also, sometimes the documentation might not be up to mark and so it might be required to go through the underlying code for the Big Data software to see how some thing works or is not working as the way it is expected to.For the above mentioned reasons knowledge of Java is must. Basics of core Java is enough, knowledge of enterprise Java is not required.Java programs can be developed with as simple as notepad. But, developing in an IDE like Eclipse makes it a piece of cake.**SQL** : Not everyone is comfortable with programming in Java and other languages. That’s the reason why SQL abstractions have been introduced on top of the different Big Data frameworks. Those who are from a database background can get very easily started with Big Data because of the SQL abstraction. Hive, Impala, Phoenix are few of such software’s.*Others* : The above mentioned skills are good enough to get started with Big Data. As one gets into more and more at Big Data, would also recommend to look at R, Python and Scala. Each of these languages have got their strength and weakness and depending upon the requirement the appropriate option can be picked to write Big Data programs.To become good at Big Data it’s required for an aspirant to have a good overview of the different technologies and the above guide mentions what is required and where to start reading about them.;

forhire;6cvxud;1495558690.0;/r/forhire/comments/6cvxud/hiring_nyc_1010data_is_hiring_a_c_developer/;[Hiring] (NYC) 1010data is hiring a C developer;"1010data is not a C shop, but we're looking for a C programmer.First, a bit about the company, and then more info about the tools we use. 1010data is a ""big data analytics platform"". We're a medium sized (~250 person) company based in NYC and have been around since 2000. I like to explain our product in the following way… Imagine Microsoft Excel (a tabular spreadsheet view of data). Put that in a web browser so we have something similar to Google Sheets. Now take 100 billion - 1 trillion rows of data, put them in a single spreadsheet, and maintain the ability to manipulate that data in real time. You can create new columns that are a function of other columns, filter and aggregate the data, run more advanced statistical analyses, visualize the data, or build a data driven web application. That's the Trillion Row Spreadsheet and it's the core product that the rest of our business is built around. Most of our server side code is written in k, which is a pretty cool language that I'm not going to discuss at length. k is an excellent tool for vector processing and distributed computing, but there are some tasks it's not well suited for, and that's where this job post becomes relevant. The Core Group at 1010data (the devs that build the product described above) includes the ""Interfacing Team"" which is responsible for two things. First, we solve the problems that k isn't well suited for. This consists of implementing some of the very high performance bits of the system that don't vectorize well, as well as integrating third party tools as to avoid reinvention of the wheel (we didn't feel the need to implement AES in k). Second, we build the code distributed to customers (k is interpreted, we generally don't like to distribute the interpreter). This code is (again) very performance sensitive, but also must be very portable (we've targeted Windows, Linux, OSX, AIX, and HP-UX to name a few targets). Put most simply, the Interfacing Team is responsible for the code that isn't written in k or JavaScript (though we do in fact do some k programming).So what are we looking for? We want someone with C/C++/other-manually-memory-managed-language programming experience who is interested in building high performance tools and libraries for manipulating big data. Generally we look favorably on people with STEM degrees, though there is some preference for people with a computer science background (you're going to be asked algorithm questions and for Big-O analyses during the interview process).  We have positions open at the entry level, though we certainly won't turn away those with deeper experience.If you're interested you can reach out to me directly, or apply via our [careers page](https://www.1010data.com/company/careers/open-positions/position/?id=599812). I am the hiring manager for the team (so I won't get any sort of bonus for applications through that link) but reaching out to me directly can skip some of the recruiting rigmarole. Note that this position is on-site so you'd have to live in or at least within a reasonable distance of New York City.";
publichealth;6cl5gx;1495427380.0;/r/publichealth/comments/6cl5gx/nutritionfocused_job_related_to_bigdatastatsecon/;Nutrition-focused job related to big-data/stats/econ for an INTJ?;Hi there,I took the myers-briggs personality test and it says I'm between an INTJ and INFJ (more T than F)... The most popular careers for this type are in: business/finance, math, engineering, and computer science.Anyone have any ideas how I could blend one of these with nutrition? Like with data science maybe? Here's a link to the INTJ career description:https://www.truity.com/personality-type/INTJ/careersI truly think I would be good at one of these careers...I love to analyze haha.;The Myers Briggs personality test is not psychologically accurate. Do not take careers advice from a test with no basis. Sure be aware of who you are, your goals, strengths and limitations. But don't trust the MB test, it's been debunked. If you want to study nutrition, then go for it! #Yeah but nutrition/dietetics is so low paying...I'm not very into science/cooking so I doubt dietetics is a good choice for me, I'm more interested in policy and stuff like that. I think the test provided me with a lot of exciting ideas that I think would fit me better.#Having read a bit of your post history, I have no clue why you'd go into dietetics if you don't like science or cooking. I also am a bit puzzled if you are analytical but don't like science. Is that all sciences (maths, chem, bio, social) or is that just the more advanced nutritional science aspects? What was your undergrad major in, if you don't mind? Dietetics very science heavy and all the dietitians or students I know are absolutely mad for cooking. Maybe ring up a local professional and ask if you can shadow them for a day or do some kind of work experience with them. Does sound like a public health study path would be worth it for you, but you just have to do some investigation. #I like math and the social sciences, but not chem and bio. This is the undergrad major I'm trying to decide on.Yeah I'm thinking public health.#I don't know if I want to go into dietetics for a career...eventually I think policy or business or something would be cool. I know it doesn't make sense to major in dietetics if I don't like science or cooking, but I thought it'd be good to have a strong understanding of the field before I went into policy or something.

You could create a range of career production numbers.Example  Fournette: Projected 8,000 to 12,000 career rushing yards, 50 to 100 TDs over 8 to 12 years;A lot changes year to year, projections for the upcoming year are enough of a crapshoot, trying to push that further would be even worse.

My primary duties in past work experiences have been developing and testing with SAP, ABAP, and workflow. I was occasionally put on other small projects and feel I am quite flexible and useful in multiple functions.53 minutes ago I was working as an IT developer for a health insurance company in Western MA. Lots of big data and reporting work with MSSQL, SSIS packages, importing/exporting claims, data transformation with c++/c#, and working with a program Luminx made by Ebix health.I have varying levels of experience working and making practical programs in a number of languages. I am most comfortable and experienced with C#, C++, Java, MSSQL, and SSIS. I have some exposure and usage in Scala, C#, xaml, html, php, FORTH, ada, perl, flex,ABAP, ASP.Net, and SSRS. I've also been highly involved in the testing aspect of all projects I have worked on.I am ideally looking for a developing, QA and testing, or IT security position (though I am open to other positions as well). Please do ask any questions you may have, or you may PM me as well if you are interested in my resume. Thank you kindly for taking the time to read this and I hope I have interested you.;Enumerating all those C#, C++, Java, SQL, flex, forth, ada, perl, scala - clearly means you know nothing useful. Reduce the list of tech stack you have and emphasize only what you are really good at.#I clearly distinguished what I am proficient in vs what I'm familiar with, and there's a big difference between someone who is familiar but not too useful in scala vs someone who has never heard of it before.#So why did you ever bring those languages, if you are just *familiar* with them?#Assuming you meant why did I learn them, some were in school where my teachers chose a random language to demonstrate the subject of the course (i.e. gui design was in C#/xaml, web design was html/php, scripting was in perl, etc.) and the language itself was secondary. Others I used in past jobs (i.e. ABAP while as an SAP consultant, asp.net when I was making web apps). I was once at least fairly proficient in each of them, but of all those mentioned in the later segment I haven't used any beyond a basic level in years.It's worth mentioning because if a company is largely based on say ADA, I would be able to read existing code to get an understanding of the companies systems, and when immersed I would be able to reach a level of proficiency within ~2 weeks. That's what happened with MSSQL, I used it in school, didn't touch it for 5+ years, but completed my first medium depth project in it within a month. ABAP on the other hand I had never heard of when I was hired as an SAP consultant, and it was ~3 months before I did much of significance with that (though some of that was due to companies long training regime)

Career Options Explained Best;*Confused about what to choose between Data Science or Data Analytics? Read this- [Big Data Vs Data Scientist Vs Data Analytics Careers](https://kovidacademy.com/data-science-vs-data-analytics/)*A lot of people are confused about these terms. Article above will explain you in details and clear your confusion about these Data Science & Data Analytics Professionals topics.So let’s get going on this discussion… Some companies don’t differentiate between a **data scientist** and **analytics** professional and use these terms interchangeably to define their team members. On the other hand, significant number of companies do have this differentiation. In general, here are the factors that in my opinion can separate the two-Here are my Top 10 Pointers to ensure durable success in either field–* Learn as much as possible. Spend 4 to 5 hours every week on the learning and development and knowing the latest in the industry.* Challenge status quo. Never assume that whatever is being done is following the most effective approach.* Believe that you are equal to everybody else in the hierarchy. Don’t be afraid to speak your mind* Focus on Innovation and coming out with the earth shattering ideas rather than doing the business as usual.* Focus on developing great communication skills and soft skill as this is one of the biggest gap I have seen in the analytics professionals.* Don’t become a one trick pony. try to get exposure in different industries and different functional areas.* Participate in competitions and events such as Kaggle, to know where you stand vis a vis your peer group.* Try to write white papers and blogs on your subject matter expertise.* Develop domain expertise as without that analytics is not effective.* Finally, always maintain a clear visibility of your strength and opportunities and any blind spots. Actively seek feedback from your peer group and your superiors.> Join Big Data Hadoop Developer Training & Certification with Multiple Tools from Kovid Academy to handle your data more efficiently and to get more topics on #BigData.;

Being a young women, very few companies would give you the chance here seeing as you have no Gulf experience.* Probably 6-8k for at least your probation period. Less if you start taking things like company transportation/accommodation.* Expenses depends entirely on the circumstances. Are you renting alone? Where are you renting? Do you already have friends in the Dubai? Without knowing these things then there's noway anyone could give you an honest answer.* Depends where you live and where your job is. The metro might be all you need, or it may be the bus and metro, or maybe a minibus service, then RTA bus, then Metro, then walk. You won't have the money to do your driving lessons for several months though unless someone gives you the money. #Its so awesome of you to quit a decent job with good peergroup to come here on 3 months Visit Visa and find a job in a IT company ( owned by Kushal Shah, who was a ex-grocery shop owner / Biju who was ex network admin.) that pays you almost the same & just sells business software or develops websites, Did u visit here few months back on a tour or something ?#[deleted]#[deleted]#[deleted]#Only if you aren't a fan of the heat...and by heat i mean ""HOLY HADES WHY IS MY FACE BURNING!"".#It's still summer , with weak economy. On the other hand , fewer people looking for jobs. #Most companies will really just look at Gulf experience, given your age most would just consider you as fresher. You're coming in as a single woman and that doesn't help much towards being seen as someone who needs a higher salary than what i mentioned.Got to be careful with who you share, renting something that's easier for you may not be easier for them, even with a car.If you really want to come to the UAE, you need to be ready to start at the bottom and at least get your foot in the door. That often means being ready to start on a low salary, especially in an already flooded IT industry that's saturated with young Indians.#1. Decent Job = Working in an organization that has a proper SOP , Career Planning mechanism etc.. Most MNCs and Indian tech orgs have it.2. Peer Group = Most of these orgs in India hire from campus. So, most certainly you have a peer group that went to moderately decent institutes and did a fulltime degree. Most of these orgs have a list of institutes from where they hire. No? . What do you think is the scene here ? . Use Linkedin & try to research.3. Most IT companies here are of the mould i mentioned.4. Hardly anybody hires or even interviews candidate who is not here. So this visit visa is inevitable.Hence, Go slow on the lame strategy of marking anything that you don't want to hear as  ""judgement"".  What did you want to hear ?  something like ""hey..orgs like Google, microsoft etc are desperately looking for someone like you that they are finding it so damn difficult to find here?"" .. Like seriously ?Many would have personal reasons to be here. Yes.  So ?#[deleted]#[deleted]#That's what the probation period is for, for the company to see what you can do. But right off the bat, they will simply look at your experience, which they will count as almost 0 due to your age and time in the Gulf.Had you been from Europe/NA then that's a different story.#lol on everything else and not on the probability of you finding work in MS/GOOG coz its quite a possibility in India.I tried to give info and you are the one who is frustrated.If you wanted specific info, you should have asked. This is a public forum. If you cant handle a bit of sarcasm, its clearly your issue :)#[deleted]#[deleted]#Best of luck to you.#Thanks a ton. You just made my day :) "

I need to encrypt datasets for storage as well as in-transit. The idea is that a person that has sensitive data might need to send it to someone else who is collaborating. So they need to be able to encrypt (large datasets) in a sane amount of time and send it which can be received and used. For storage encryption, I looked at hadoop transparent encryption, but dont know how (or even if) it works for in-transit data. I need to learn more about security in big data too.So my 2 questions are :1. How to encrypt large datasets which are going to be in-transit? (without assuming much about hardware/software availability)2. Any security standards or other related info regarding big data.;Hpe securedata might be of use.  Encrypt close to the source as possible then have them call to decrypt it via ldap authorization. This secures it at rest and in transit as it encrypts before landing. #Is Hpe securedata opensource ? If not, is there a solution that is?

For those that don't have the time to read the whole report but have an interest in the subject, here is the conclusion:>The Social Credit System embodies China’s vision to create a highly effective and,at the same time, adaptive economy under political leadership. If implemented asplanned, the system has the potential to become the most globally sophisticatedand fine-tuned model for IT-backed and big data-enabled market regulation. Itwould deeply transform the Chinese economy and provide China’s policymakerswith a tool to effectively and rapidly react to upcoming social and environmentalchallenges as well as to new technologies and industrial developments. >China’sgovernment will attempt to use the Social Credit System to channel investmentinto cutting-edge technologies and to steer companies into patterns of behavioruseful in solving social and environmental problems. This could, in turn, accelerateleapfrogging processes, innovative business activities, and the Chinese society’sability to quickly adapt to unforeseen changes. In this case, Western market economies, in comparison, would appear slow-moving and highly fragmented, with aweak capacity for implementation and lacking in long-term strategy. In the visionof China’s leadership, liberal market economies would ultimately not be able tocompete with the Chinese unidirectional approach.Yet China’s vision of comprehensively steering economic activities is veryambitious. >The project will not necessarily be crowned with success. Given its limitations and weaknesses, the Social Credit System might just as easily result ina massive decline in investments, the failure of whole industries, low innovativepower, and little entrepreneurial initiative. Whether or not the Chinese approachwill prove to be better suited to the technological, social, and environmental challenges of the 21st century remains to be seen. It is certain, however, that the Chinese leadership is fully committed to investing everything necessary in order forits mammoth Social Credit System project to succeed.

I recently thought about the business niche and the place of these services in the modern world.We all remember the start of the Google Dorks era and how it changed the threat landscape around the world.In my opinion the paradigm ""security by obscurity"" was replaced by a new reality where the Big data reigns.Now many questions can be solved without resorting to active intelligence. The gathering information is expected to be reduced to OSINT and SaaS.I'm the same geek as you. When I have questions I go and ask this issues to community.I would like to know your opinion on the following questions:1. What do you feel about what do this services (Censys, Shodan, ZoomEye, etc)? (from a moral point of view)2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of these services compared to each other? I would be grateful if you advice me alternatives.3. Is there an underground spirit in them?4. Why these services don't work with crypto-currencies?5. Why these services don't try to work on the ipv6 address space?6. Why they don't scan all ports?I'm interested to hear your opinion.";Ok, since nobody else has responded.Morally? They are the only ethical thing to do. Obscurity is not security. By exposing these services in an easy to use manner we are increasing the overall visibility so the community can use this tool for good. Any service can be used incorrectly but that doesn't mean it is immoral. Isn't it moral to own a gun to protect your family, while guns can be used for crime?Honestly shodan is the strongest. It has the best filtering and most features. The api is very coherant, but it could be faster. There is indeed an underground spirit. I have personally talked to the founder of shodan and he is an awesome dude, very salt of the earth, comes directly from the hacking community.They dont take coins for the same reason many people don't, it can be inconvenient.And for the same reason they don't scan every port they can't scan ipv6. The raw bandwidth is massive to scan the minimal set they currently scan.Alternatives? Really if shodan doesn't meet your needs, you need to build your own solution. A combo of masscan and nmap exported to csv, and then say converted into json and fed into something like elastic search would give you the feature set of shodan with your own custom dataset. If you want to build a gui around it that shouldnt be too difficult. if you need to target a service that isn't on shodan, thats your way to go. VPS for scanning with a provider that is friendly is cheap and you get your data in real time.#Thanks for the detailed answer. Taking this opportunity I would like to ask a couple more questions:1. Is it true that for the first time Shodan was little known (people just didn't understand why they needed it)?2. I recently tried to evaluate the business model of Shodan from a financial point of view. My figures didn't match.  If we assume that shodan makes a profit then the only option that I see in this case is the following. Most people are interested in the same thing and Shodan has hot data and cold data. Hot data is constantly updated and sold immediately to millions of hands, cold data is updated very rarely (often for a single order). Have you any assumptions about the relationship between hot data and cold data?3. Another ageless question. I agree with you on the technical feasibility of the alternative. It so happened that I'm a technician and marketing problems are foreign for me. Well, suppose I'll make another alternative. How to present it? How to promote it? How will people find out about it? How much money will it take to start? I understand that there is no silver bullet, that it's impossible to transfer the talent of marketing in a pair of proposals. You said that you personally know the founder of the Shodan. Maybe you have something to advise me on this issue. Perhaps you have some stories that will help me.

Metal in the morning, Chopin the next? Searching for ABC all the time, then switching to XYZ? And so on? What does happen in such cases? ;"Chances are unless a lot of other people switch habits in a similar way, it won't be able to make meaningful predictions about that person.Big data is an interesting subject that has the potential to reveal a lot about human behaviours, with all manner of potential efficency savings and other improvements coming about as a result. What it can't do is predict things about specific individuals with a high degree of accuracy. It is however pretty good when dealing with big groups. (Almost like a crude version of issac asimovs 'psychohistory' concept). Think of it like this-if you watch a lot of science fiction movies it might predict you're likely to like the lord of the rings movies. There's no guarantee you will, but if a lot of sci-fi fans like fantasy as well then statistically there's a good chance you will to.#Okay, so it can say *""group XYZ is most likely to watch that movie""*, but not really able to say what I personally am going to watch?#More or less. behind the scenes It'll actually be something like 'there's a 70% chance you'll like this movie' so I'll suggest it. I.e of the sample data it had to work 7 of ten people who liked sci-fi also liked lord of the rings.Of course this is a pretty straightforward extrapolation that pretty much anyone could make. 'Big data' is all about finding and extrapolating correlations that aren't obvious or apparent.In a previous job for example I did some work trying correlate weather to airline bookings and discovered that cold weather in the summer increased bookings but had no measurable effect any other time of the year. Warm weather on the other hand increased bookings in the winter, decreased bookings in the summer, but again not at any other time of the year. It doesn't mean much on an individual level of course. You might be slightly more inclined to book a flight depending on the weather and the time of year, but chances are it wouldn't change what you're going to do. Collectively en masse though the effect is significant. Then if you also Factored in other things like Age, gender, ethnicity, education level, past travel history and household income and you might start to see some very distinct clear cut patterns.That's where big data comes in. It can make interesting observations about large bodies of people and through that can make reasonably educated guesses about things that you are likely to do."

personalfinance;6gh193;1497122423.0;/r/personalfinance/comments/6gh193/should_i_ask_for_a_raise/;Should I ask for a raise?;[deleted];In general, I think it's not a great idea to ask for a raise until your first annual review. Go to that prepared with details on how much you've helped the company - be specific.My bigger issue with your situation is the pressure your girlfriend is putting on you to make more money. That's not going to be great in the long term.#The company is small enough to where they don't do any of the performance reviews. The annual review won't happen. The girlfriend part is another issue I am currently working on. I want to make a good living for her. And just as everyone else, we all want more money.I do understand that the one year mark is a big hurdle or criterion before asking for a raise. I was wondering if it is a possibility to ask once my results of my projects come to light as highly profitable?I didn't do internships throughout college, so I understand my starting salary may be a little lower than normal. I am a fast learner, (got a masters degree right after turning 24) and work hard. I always read to better myself academically after work.
explainlikeimfive;6di7zj;1495818207.0;/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6di7zj/eli5why_havent_voice_text_and_other_recognition/;ELI5:Why haven't voice, text and other recognition software developed enough to be reliable and more commonplace?;I see a lot of companies saying you can turn your handwriting into typed-up text but it only really works if you're very specific about your handwriting. With voices though I find it very surprising that people can't use big data to tell an AI system all the different ways people say words and the context in which they're used. If you look at YouTube's auto-caption or auto-translate software it sometimes gets things right but usually it's either broken grammar or complete nonsense. I get that it's probably very hard to do but with all these amazing companies trying to tackle this problem I just find it amazing that we haven't progressed further with this. ;"It's an extremely difficult task, have you ever tried to understand someone who just learned english? It's similar, and on top of that AI is very young and is a whole other item to tackle the short answer is they're learning how to play baseball while watching a football movie and sitting in a gymnasium for Basketball.#> I get that it's probably very hard to do but with all these amazing companies trying to tackle this problem I just find it amazing that we haven't progressed further with this.As a general rule asking ""Why isn't this technology more advanced?"" is about as deep a question as asking ""Why isn't the world a better place?""The tech isn't better because nobody has made it better, probably because they don't know how. People have been making it better for years and they didn't just choose to make it less good than they could for no reason. ""But they are so smart!"" isn't a meaningful criticism of our current progress.#Your brain is humongous.  In comparison to any computer you're likely to be able to carry it's billions of times more powerful.  With such a powerful processor it takes years of skilled education from your parents and teachers to teach you a language.  Really understanding Shakespeare or Melville takes knowledge of huge amounts of data.  Language is abstract, and that makes it much more difficult than games like chess or Go.  The degrees of freedom are orders of magnitude harder.Sure, Minsky promised universal translation in 10 years in the 1960s.  Other than that he was a genius."

What do you feel about what do this services (Censys, Shodan, ZoomEye, etc)? (from a moral point of view)2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of these services compared to each other?

We're a medium sized (~250 person) company located in midtown east (46th & 3rd) and have been around since 2000. I like to explain our product in the following way… Imagine Microsoft Excel (a tabular spreadsheet view of data). Put that in a web browser so we have something similar to Google Sheets. Now take 100 billion - 1 trillion rows of data, put them in a single spreadsheet, and maintain the ability to manipulate that data in real time. You can create new columns that are a function of other columns, filter and aggregate the data, run more advanced statistical analyses, visualize the data, or build a data driven web application. That's the Trillion Row Spreadsheet and it's the core product that the rest of our business is built around.Most of our server side code is written in k, which is a pretty cool language that I'm not going to discuss at length. k is an excellent tool for vector processing and distributed computing, but there are some tasks it's not well suited for, and that's where this job post becomes relevant. The Core Group at 1010data (the devs that build the product described above) includes the ""Interfacing Team"" which is responsible for two things. First, we solve the problems that k isn't well suited for. This consists of implementing some of the very high performance bits of the system that don't vectorize well, as well as integrating third party tools as to avoid reinvention of the wheel (we didn't feel the need to implement AES in k). Second, we build the code distributed to customers (k is interpreted, we generally don't like to distribute the interpreter). This code is (again) very performance sensitive, but also must be very portable (we've targeted Windows, Linux, OSX, AIX, and HP-UX to name a few targets). Put most simply, the Interfacing Team is responsible for the code that isn't written in k or JavaScript (though we do in fact do some k programming).So what are we looking for? We want someone with C/C++/other-manually-memory-managed-language programming experience who is interested in building high performance tools and libraries for manipulating big data. Generally we look favorably on people with STEM degrees, though there is some preference for people with a computer science background (you're going to be asked algorithm questions and for Big-O analyses during the interview process).  We have positions open at the entry level, though we certainly won't turn away those with deeper experience.If you're interested you can reach out to me directly, or apply via our [careers page](https://www.1010data.com/company/careers/open-positions/position/?id=599812). I am the hiring manager for the team (so I won't get any sort of bonus for applications through that link) but reaching out to me directly can skip some of the recruiting rigmarole.";

I work for a small, Raleigh-based company that helps startups and large enterprises find software engineers, big data analysts, and other tech professionals for Direct Hire and long-term contract roles. We have placed 5 of the 6 people on the team I'm about to introduce and are looking for 1 more Senior Developer to bring on board.Today I'm working with one of our clients to hire a permanent Senior PHP Developer for his terabyte-processing healthcare application. It's an awesome, complex operation that they are working on and the team needs another Senior PHP developer who has worked on this scale before. You will need expert PHP skills that don't always require a framework to be optimized and a high comfort level writing SQL queries to work full-stack(and no, you won't be a DBA). If this sounds interesting to you, PM me so I can give you more info. I just hired a QA engineer to this team and he says he is growing tremendously there. This is a DIRECT HIRE role with great benefits and bonus incentives for learning new personal coding skills. They are on-site in downtown Raleigh, NC (no remote applicants or c2c consultants). Unfortunately, no sponsorship is available. If you are interested, PM me immediately and lets introduce you to the hiring manager!;

I remarked upon this discovery to some co workers that someone has to be funding this. There's no way that all of it is done on the cheap, and millions of dollars are being poured into shaping the current narrative. Now we have our answer, another douche bag fucking billionaire screwing us over. As if the Koch brothers weren't bad enough, this fuckwad is supporting white supremacists who want to ""peacefully"" ethnically cleanse the US. #Wow, I had heard his name before but didn't know of his connections (meddling?).

There's nothing sinister going on there.  It's just a business (or businesses) operating multiple outlets that market one another to generate more clicks.  It's not rocket surgery and it's not expensive.  You pay (cheaply) by the article licensed for multiple sites which encourages the writers to generate additional content for more pay.

Did you see who is in the white house? Do you see who's actually in charge?#This is just one, relatively new, type of manipulation. Democracy is inseparable from manipulation. ""Demagogues"" is not simply a fancy Greek slapped on a new notion, it is a word originated in Ancient Greece. It's an immanent flaw of democracy. One needs to _convince_ majority of population to do something, while vast majority of time the majority is plain vanilla clueless. Why do you have swing voters in the first place? How is it possible that a person who has no idea what candidate is ""right"" (meaning represents what the person thinks) still decides to vote? This flaw of democracy can be fixed in more than one way. One is by countering manipulation with opposite manipulation: that's what people do now. The other one is simply excluding idiots from the process that nobody tries. #I fully agree - there is a desperate need for broad, universal campaigns aiming to inform people that their social media profiles are affected by outside influences. I know people who think that their Facebook feeds are just determined by who they're friends with. And it's that exact intimacy that technology like this preys on: people lower their guard when they're going through social media, expecting the information they receive to come from trusted sources and close acquaintances.No matter where one stands ideologically, one should be concerned about this. We simply need to spread awareness that technology like this exists now, and that it increasingly is being utilized in political and commercial concerns. If there's no corresponding awareness among the population to meet this new development, it may become disproportionately influential and complete skewer the democratic, deliberative process.#IMHO not enough people realize their social media ""world"" is being manipulated in such a manner, and I think it's crucial to be aware of this kind of stuff for the future. #The right always invents a bogeyman who they claim is doing exactly what they are doing, to distract.#Yes, the right needs their boogeyman too and it's George Soros. However, whenever I ask someone about what exactly he's accomplished I get blank stares. #redditor hypocrisy, it is a SJW disease#Soros helps fund election campaigns for candidates favourable to American interests in eastern and Central Europe. Opening up the markets, neoliberal reform, joining NATO, etcHe's a rightwing boogeyman#What exactly? He hasn't lived here in years and he certainly doesn't pay taxes here.

The right-wing overtly ruins the US constitution, the less right-wing states get fed up with the tyranny of the minority and somehow we split into 2+ countries.It would be ugly and probably take a generation to sort out, but I have to imagine that the northeast and the west coast are pretty tired of being under the thumb of the right-wing states.#Hey, thanks for helping me win my game of ""overly-reductive leftist buzzword bingo"".#I think you're leaving out another important driving factor: whiteness.

And neither is the right. They're both just tools used to distract people from the real people in control. (And likewise, there are good people on both sides of the aisle.)It's pretty coincidental that liberal outlets/media have stopped complaining about ""corrupt corporations."" Because they're owned by the same people. 5 corporations control 90% OF ALL US MEDIA. [Google it.]Pretty coincidental that both the left and right are pro-military industrial-complex and would never take on something like the F-35 after going hundreds of billions over budget.It's also pretty coincidental that all the hot button issues the left and right do ""care"" about, never change. For example, Republicans grand stand about abortion, but do you really think they want abortion gone? Why would you get rid of something that ALWAYS gets you re-elected? You can just say every election cycle, ""They're killing our babies!"" and get re-elected. Likewise, remember Obama? That guy that was going to ""change"" everything? How'd that work out for us? Drone strikes on US citizens. Record classified documents. Spying and wire-tapping  journalists. Selling guns to Mexican drug dealers. And... coincidentally... NOT prosecuting the Wall Street banks? Why would a politician not prosecute the richest people in the world? Could it be... SHOCK... that they bought him out?George Soros, this other guy, I don't care. I'm sick and damn tired of people taking paychecks to piss in our faces and tell us it's raining. #haha. hahahaha. hahahahahahhahaha.edit: hahahahahahah.#Seriously, the right hasn't been controlling media for decades?#This would require education being funded and universal. #As if they don't have mountains of filters to deal with such an obvious attempt to poison the well - these are *multi*-**billion**-dollar enterprises  they are better resourced than most *countries*.

I agree that it's a flaw in democracy, probably unfixable. I hold out hope for a future 'benevolent elite' one that doesn't care about further enriching themselves and accruing even more power to their class. I know I'm naïve, but it's all that's left, isn't it?#> simply excluding idiotsYeah, that cure is a disease worse than the disease.#Attempts at manipulation are one thing, and part of democracy. I've yet to see an article demonstrate that it actually works at all. I mean, there's zero proof it changes people's minds from what they already believe. #indeed! ive tried my best to explain to those i care about (and some that i dont) how important safe guarding private info is, but i feel like it falls on deaf ears most of the time. its especially disheartening since most all them know that i generally dont get very vocal about a lot of issues.#And I'm thinking this tactic was created, employed, and perpetuated by the likes of Robert Mercer and the weaponized bots.#Honest question.

Very curious.To me he is still on outsider despite his wealth.  I thinks it's evident in how the media and big corps are aligned against him.  This article is further proof of that in my opinion.#No, it hasnt. A small handful of companies have owned basically all major news outlets for a long time. It's no coincidence that almost all major new sources have a left bent to them. They are all pushing the same agenda. But now that the right is doing the same thing suddenly you people care about unbiased news? It's impressive.

His associate Steve Bannon is now the senior White House advisor.     This story details how Mercer utilized his computer science background to fund one of the growing political forces in our nation. Mercer has bankrolled major media upstarts like Breitbart, big data companies like Cambridge Analytica that utilized AI and pattern recognition to help sway the vote in both Brexit and later the US election, and building an army of Twitter bots and pro-Trump websites that will drown out mainstream media as ""fake news"" and replace it with their own alternate reality of how the world is. #[This](https://scout.ai/story/the-rise-of-the-weaponized-ai-propaganda-machine) article is a nice summary of what Cambridge Analytica did.""By leveraging automated emotional manipulation alongside swarms of bots, Facebook dark posts, A/B testing, and fake news networks, a company called Cambridge Analytica has activated an invisible machine that preys on the personalities of individual voters to create large shifts in public opinion. Many of these technologies have been used individually to some effect before, but together they make up a nearly impenetrable voter manipulation machine that is quickly becoming the new deciding factor in elections around the world.Most recently, Analytica helped elect U.S. President Donald Trump, secured a win for the Brexit Leave campaign, and led Ted Cruz’s 2016 campaign surge, shepherding him from the back of the GOP primary pack to the front.The company is owned and controlled by conservative and alt-right interests that are also deeply entwined in the Trump administration. The Mercer family is both a major owner of Cambridge Analytica and one of Trump’s biggest donors. Steve Bannon, in addition to acting as Trump’s Chief Strategist and a member of the White House Security Council, is a Cambridge Analytica board member. Until recently, Analytica’s CTO was the acting CTO at the Republican National Convention. ""#This is great research and reporting. It fills in some gaps for me. #All of this stuff is really overblown. It's nice, fits into a narrative of shady billionaires psycographically manipulating people and entering their minds etc etc but there isn't actually much to it beyond pseudo conspiracy theory narratives. Clinton's campaign, for a start, [had access to a lot more information due to having the databases that Obama's team had built over the previous elections](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-01/trump-s-secret-sauce-is-just-more-ketchup) (except for a lot of data that the Obama team had used in a third party app that allowed them to target specific people, which Facebook banned because they considered it's use unethical.)The Obama team are the original masters of this sort of stuff, and it's likely that if there were an information/data disparity, it would have favoured the Clinton campaign. There were some shady things Trumps team did regarding 'dark posts', attempts at voter suppression, but there's no evidence they had any effect. Social media is a great way to reach people, but it is not yet really a great way to read them.Regarding Brexit, it's even further off. [Dominic Cummings](https://twitter.com/odysseanproject/status/832992607836000256), the head of the leave campaign and an expert on data use in campaigns, has also said that [Anything you read about Cambridge Analytica, 'psychographics', & social media in politics is ~99% likely to be bullshit](https://twitter.com/odysseanproject/status/831826387241693185) because the [Big5 personality adds relatively little predictive pwr. Demographics overwhelmingly more important for predicting &/or digital comms](https://twitter.com/odysseanproject/status/831826800892338177). If you read Cummings' [20,000 word post on the referendum, in which he outlines the techniques thy used](https://dominiccummings.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/on-the-referendum-21-branching-histories-of-the-2016-referendum-and-the-frogs-before-the-storm-2/) or read Shipmans book on Brexit [All Out War](https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Out-War-Britains-Political/dp/0008215154/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1488120151&sr=8-1&keywords=all+out+war) you'll see that the Brexit campaign focused mostly on demographics, with Vote Leave geo-targeting people between the ages of 35-55, who lived outside of Scotland, London and areas with high UKIP vote. They did this with a massive social media post blitz in the last 5 days of the campaign, a strategy they called 'Waterloo'. (E: note this was not the sole reason they won, when votes are as close as they are in Brexit or in the Trump election, it isn't really possible to reach 'one single reason' as to why something happened, despite our natural human bias to seek simple narratives that help us understand complex things.)Again, there's a nice narrative here, and Cambridge Analytica do all they can to play into it, with their University town/fake latin word name, and a shady posh english bloke doing their presentations, they have crafted themselves a niche as the evil geniuses out of an 80's action movie. But there is very little cold hard evidence in the article that speaks to the effectiveness of the 'big 5 traits' methods. It's not even new, its been in use in various fields for decades. #Fascinating. Thanks for sharing this OP.#Democrats were the early adopters for social media in politics, especially in 2012 - using these new technologies to influence voters.   That was ok - right?  But the GOP caught up and got better at it - and thats bad, right?Sore losers.#>a determined plutocrat and a brilliant media strategist can, and have, found a way to mould journalism to their own ends.As compared to the billionaire plutocrats, who currently own the mainstream media companies, who would never use journalism to their own ends.#Brietbart as an example of taking back the culture? The publication barely follows basic journalism practices. It takes commodity stories, obscure tidbits, and recycles them as barely disguised opinion pieces. Its comment section is often a cesspool of racism, rage and ignorance.  And computer scientist? Big whoop. There are a lot of people with extraordinary computer skills out there. #It was easily foreseen. Control the message to control the masses. This is just on the scale of the internet. Scary to think how tight the screws would have been now had the internet not crept up in the 90's.#Hey can you please link me where you found he was top donator to the Trump campaign? I looked for a while after reading about one of his employees at Renaissance and was unable to find the amount he donated. Edit: I know it says he was the largest donor in the article but it's not linked to any source. #Was he profiting off it ? I mean a short position on GBP post Brexit would have netted a lot of money. If that's the case then it's a James Bond villain level of douche baggery. #""AI"" and ""pattern recognition"". This may seem super-scary to people who don't work in these fields, but honestly this is just saying they do exploratory analysis of data and try to run predictive analytics, basically what every Tom, Dick, and Harry internet store is hiring data scientists to do. It's incredibly noisy and even on much simpler matters like ROI (compared to electoral choice) it isn't a sure thing by any means. I get the fact that people want to big up their adversaries to make their past losses seem inevitable, but this is feeding into general science and tech illiteracy. BTW Hillaryforamerica had an internal data science shop that might have been referred to under these same scary undertones given a shifting of ~100,000 votes.#Waiting with baited breath for the Guardian articles on Correct the Record and Shareblue.  Correct the Record spent $10 million shilling on reddit, twitter and facebook LAST YEAR. Shareblue now has a $40 million budget to do the same. So that's two left wing groups who have spend fifty times as much as this guy did to spread propaganda. Surely the Guardian is very concerned about this. >Cambridge Analytica that utilized AI and pattern recognition to help sway the vote in both Brexit and later the US election,See, this is why trust for the media is hovering at around 12%. #[deleted]#So basically the rights version of Eric Schmidt.https://qz.com/520652/groundwork-eric-schmidt-startup-working-for-hillary-clinton-campaign/#I knew Trump & Cruz were somehow connected, finally my newest favorite global conspiracy theory has merit. #>By leveraging automated emotional manipulation alongside swarms of bots, Facebook dark posts, A/B testing, and fake news networks, a company called Cambridge Analytica has activated an invisible machine that preys on the personalities of individual voters to create large shifts in public opinion.

Every internet marketer does all of this every day at work. Shareblue, the successor to David Brock's Correct the Record now has a $40 million budget to do just this. I guess calling it a ""voter manipulation machine"" instead of standard best practices for advertising on facebook sounds much scarier though. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/david-brock-fundraising-trump-233974>Dark posts were also used to depress voter turnout among key groups of democratic voters. “In this election, dark posts were used to try to suppress the African-American vote,” wrote journalist and Open Society fellow McKenzie Funk in a New York Times editorial. “According to Bloomberg, the Trump campaign sent ads reminding certain selected black voters of Hillary Clinton’s infamous ‘super predator’ line. It targeted Miami’s Little Haiti neighborhood with messages about the Clinton Foundation’s troubles in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.’”So... targeted advertising to sway someone's opinion. I guess that could be considered as an attempt to ""depress the voter turnout among key groups of democratic voters"" in the same way that the millions of trump=hitler ads did the same for conservatives. Clearly though, only one is evil according to the left. Tje DNC spent $1.2 BILLION this cycle to lose the election. $1.2 billion. #The communications director, Andy Wigmore, for Leave.eu, one of the biggest organizations supportive and active  for the brexit campaign in England. ""The strategy involved harvesting data from people’s Facebook and other social media profiles and then using machine learning to “spread” through their networks. Wigmore admitted the technology and the level of information it gathered from people was “creepy”. He said the campaign used this information, combined with artificial intelligence, to decide who to target with highly individualised advertisements and had built a database of more than a million people, based on advice Cambridge Analytica supplied. Two weeks ago Arron Banks, Leave.eu’s founder, stated in a series of tweets that Gerry Gunster (Leave.eu’s pollster) and Cambridge Analytica with “world class” AI had helped them gain “unprecedented levels of engagement”. “AI won it for Leave,” he said.""When an influential member of a political movement known for playing around with the facts is ready to admit that these practices had an impact on elections, we should take these claims seriously. Robert Mercer offered these services for free towards the Brexit campaign, in direct contradiction of UK political finance laws. Robert Mercer is known most famously for being the primary financial doner to both Breitbart news and the Donald Trump campaign. Cambridge Analytica may have played a small role in this, but the wider machinery that it is a part of is far more sinister. The quote for the first paragraph is within this article - https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/us-billionaire-mercer-helped-back-brexit#https://scout.ai/story/the-rise-of-the-weaponized-ai-propaganda-machine#Except Cambridge Analytica likely has the firepower of Renaissance Technologies, the most successful hedge fund ever, which Mercer is co-CEO of.  Everyone uses data, but to those of us in the financial world Renaissance is the king. They really are very the best at it.  #Thank you for bringing the chill. Cummings' explanation for the Brexit campaign is pretty much how I saw Trump organizing in the US: target middle-aged voters in red states who felt angry with how their life turned out and point the finger at ""the system"". All he had to do was stay on message while the left collapsed in on itself. Sure big data and bots played a small role in developing strategic campaign insights, but it's not mind control. You still have to figure out ways to get constituents to the polls. #Curious... How do determine fact from propaganda? #> As compared to the billionaire plutocrats, who currently own the mainstream media companies, who would never use journalism to their own ends.I don't get it. How do you get media without private ownership. Good media and certainly big media is expensive so billionaire ownership seems practically baked in. There's nothing new under the sun, see Hearst newspapers. It's a problem, but to what extent? Surely there exists some diversity among media, both in ownership and rank and file. they can't all be corrupt to the same extent and in the same manner, and not necessarily at all. And what about the consumers' responsibility, like to be discerning, reasonably educated and not grossly intolerant? People seem awfully cavalier in forgetting that a POV, say of a journalist or owner etc, doesn't just translate to a lack of integrity too.As I recall, CNN rocked under Ted Turner and only went south after AOL. Bill Moyers has had the same very conservative sponsor for decades, with zero interference (because integrity.) Democracy Now has a strong left POV and impeccable integrity, but it's far from mainstream. FOX News and Murdoch, moony owned Washington Times, are easily identified examples of low integrity.I guess I'm saying we need to stop killing things we need, like the post office, the school, and the fucking newspaper. We need a ""mainstream media"" and, as it's always been, we need to encourage its good works, condemn its abuses, and forgive its honest mistakes and imperfections born of unavoidable human failings.And we need to recognize the trump/republican imperative. It is to marginalize only opposition from media, leaving only trump/republican media which will increasingly be indistinguishable from state media.#I strongly disagree with you.  I think that the Internet has led to *more* message control than would exist without it.#[deleted]#It's not the techno-babble that makes this scary. Using terms like ""AI"" and ""pattern recognition"" aren't what make the article unnerving. It's that these things are being used in the service of **propaganda**, and ostensibly propaganda that aims to dismantle our democratic institutions one department at a time (at least here in the states). Personally, I find *that* to be ""super-scary"".#The university doctor quoted in the article says his research group can predict personality better than an individuals spouse can with only 150 facebook likes as data. Him, who should I trust, a named and quoted university doctor who is the head of a research group telling me this stuff is scarily accurate or a random person on the internet telling me that this analysis is 'incredibly noisy'.Also, how exactly are articles like this feeding into tech and science illiteracy? What a crazy claim to make. As you point out, all sides of politics have access to these methods, ignoring this and pretending it is not significant represents tech illiteracy. Talking about it does not.#Read up on Cambridge Analytica, it's about targeting ads on facebook to specific individuals, not just demographics.  Door knockers know lots about the cultural preferences of the person who opens the door and choose a script that resonates most strongly.It's not exploratory analysis, it's extraordinary analysis, and there's a lot of psychology involved.#I think it's a little different for me, as this is my bread and butter. Renaissance Technologies, has AI and various models which do a VERY good job of performing certain kinds of automated trading. So what's scary to me is that some VERY smart guys decided to simply print a bunch of money, and then pay out crackpot politicians and roll to see what they could get away with.And as it happens, they were able to get away with the US presidency.#Why should anyone care? Money has always influnced politics, the issue here is a campaign of misinformation and propaganda. Who gives a shit about Soros.#Not to mention Reddit and some users practically doing the same thing by using algorythyms to filter ""unpopular"" subreddits and comments, as well as the propensity of some outside the internet to control the messages they're subjected to by tightly controlling what voices are allowed to be heard#I don't think that's an equal comparison. Schmidt basically funded a data analysis, PR campaign. Mercer, according to this article, is basically trying to create a quasi-state sponsored propaganda machine that only allows reporting that is favorable to Trump. #>to decide who to target with highly individualised advertisements The clinton campaign spent $1.2 BILLION to lose the election. Surely they did it with like, door knocking and postcards and would NEVER use targeted advertising on facebook? or you know, paid shills on reddit, facebook, and twitter. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/21/hillary-pac-spends-1-million-to-correct-commenters-on-reddit-and-facebook.htmlThis budget increased to $10 million by the end of her campaign. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/us/politics/hillary-clinton-media-david-brock.htmlShareblue now has a $40 million budget to ""fight trump"". http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/david-brock-fundraising-trump-233974Surely this same group that secret paid shills to ""correct"" people online is going to ""fight trump"" with gumdrops and rainbows instead of targeted facebook ads. #You'll almost never need to separate fact from propaganda since propaganda is almost always in the realm of opinion. #I think it's all propaganda in some way. Even a completely independent journalist, if that exists, still has their own biases. The journalists in the mainstream media are in no way independent. I think you have to take the publications' biases/owners/agenda, whatever else into consideration when analyzing an article. Take it as data for building your own picture of reality, upon investigating many sources critically.If you're looking for a one stop shop to tell you the true nature of reality/ facts, I don't think you're going to find it. #It's pretty easy actually. Just look for patterns. >NBC's Chuck Todd said he ""thought it was an extraordinarily **dark** speech.""  >ABC's George Stephanopoulos seemed to agree, saying that Trump ""painted a **dark** picture of where America stands today."">Politico has a Friday headline that reads: ""Obama rejects Trump's **dark** America."">That happens to be similar to a headline in The Nation: ""Donald Trump’s Angry, **Dark** Speech Caps Off a Disastrous RNC."">That sounds like a headline at CBS News: ""Donald Trump offers **dark** vision of America in GOP convention speech."">The Washington Post: ""Donald Trump’s **dark** speech to the Republican National Convention, annotated."">The New Yorker: ""Donald Trump's **Dark, Dark** Convention Speech."">And of course, The New York Times headline: ""His Tone **Dark,** Donald Trump Takes G.O.P. Mantle."">**Interestingly, Hillary Clinton's campaign described it the same way: ""Tonight, Donald Trump painted a dark picture of an America in decline.""**#The increased message control is a result of the message getting out of control because of the internet. Message control was never a concern in the 80s and only the internet has made it so that message control has become government #1 issue.And the powers that be aren't doing the best job controlling the message. Thats why its being flooded with false and negative journalism. The internet brought anonymity, thats the greatest fear for government.#Very good read thanks for the link! Further cements my belief that the Mercers are the puppeteers behind Trump. I just hope everyone involved in this new wave of AI driven propaganda takes a moment to fully appreciate the risks. #I agree to an extent, and I seek solace in the fact that we are pretty complicated beings and that the tech is still not that good.However, ""propaganda"" is a rather loose term. Anything you disagree with that is promoted by a government can be labeled that. The Obama admin meticulously focus-grouped ideas and presentation, and the right claimed the same about them. Finally, liberal democracy is based on a notion of free will. If you believe data-based propaganda removes that from individuals, then that is an argument worth having about representative government in the age of machines. If not, then it is basically an escalation of what we have already had - a media-war by moneyed interests of two sides, with broadly similar toolkits. If anything, we should welcome the fact that the knowledge behind it is democratized and can be deconstructed (a small silver-lining, I know).#I am, unfortunately, an unnamed ""university doctor"" at a similar institution, and work on similar topics. You can read the paper here: http://www.pnas.org/content/112/4/1036Couple take-aways: friends and machines are both crappy judges of your big 5 personality traits, which are pretty broad buckets *chosen* to be robust. To say that they can predict *behavior* is another thing entirely, though there is plenty of work on that topic.I would also encourage you to see the following Randall Munroe comic: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/05/phd051809s.gifIt is in a university's interest for the PR office to hype every paper, and it is in a news organization's interest to hype the already hyped PR copy. That this work was done by a B-school prof who is aware of the hype game and seems to do a pretty decent job of hyping things on his website seems beside the point.Also, note that I am not saying we should not be concerned. Concern is needed, especially when data is used for things like police racial profiling: e.g., more data exists about minority criminals, so algorithm learns that race is a predictor of crime, leading to targeting of said minority and a higher arrest rate through false positives, setting off the loop again. This is not what is happening here. However, protecting our data from aggregation is only a good thing. predictive analytics are pretty shoddy right now, but even simple algorithms applied to a lifetime of data can be pretty successful. What I am more concerned about is what will come in the future, with better analytics, when it might be too late to move towards preserving our privacy.Finally, on ""feeding into tech and science illiteracy"": I believe for us scientists to have the continued support of tax-payers, we need to be as transparent about our methods and our shortcomings as possible. If we pretend that whatever is in our latest paper is ""science itself"", we risk the credibility of our profession when the next scientist comes along and proves us wrong. I realize that news does not deal with ""may"" and ""likely"", but we need to bring our scientific caution to the public sphere. It will have the added benefit of protecting science from charlatans who use that fake certainty [which is different from the overwhelming consensus] in areas where it is not warranted (I know I might be starting a firestorm, but the evangelical atheists who propose a form of scientism come to mind). It will also hopefully encourage a new generation of scientists from less privileged backgrounds to see that scientists are people like them, making mistakes and lucky guesses rather than divining results.Sorry for the rant.#Mate, I really don't want to get into this, but see this: http://civichall.org/civicist/preparing-campaign-tech-bullshit-season/I know Cambridge Analytica, and I know ad-tech reasonably well (google's valuation is based on reaching people, not demographics(?!), through ads - CA did not invent internet advertising).Dave Karpf, the author of the article, and many other psychologists believe that CA's psychometric schtick is just for sales. But, unfortunately, whatever data you have on hand, it is extraordinarily hard to get people to change their mind, and the process is very non-linear, so I cannot count on changing yours, as you likely cannot count on changing mine :)#Russian foreign influence on US elections : Huge scandalUS right wing billionaire foreign influence on UK elections : Medium scandalUS left wing billionaire foreign influence on all EU elections : It's ok, Soros is part of the Axis of Progress.#I just don't want to see any more posts about Dota2, okay?

Anything you disagree with that is promoted by a government can be labeled that.Not if you're honest. I'm claiming that what the Trump campaign and Cambridge Analytica did is a textbook case of propaganda: using misleading, dishonest misinformation to sway public opinion in favor of a political party or position.Focus groups are *not* propaganda. Good advertisement is *not* (necessarily) propaganda. Deliberately misleading and telling lies to the public is absolutely, 100% propaganda. What you're attempting to do is remove all meaning from the word, and I frankly find *that* dishonest. Let's agree on the meaning of this word, then. Propaganda entails *lying* to the public in order to sway their opinion on important social topics. Do you think that's okay?#> the tech is still not that good.Well they won 2/2 elections that all the experts thought they wouldn't/couldn't/shouldn't, so clearly it's good enough to win the presidency.  How good is ""that good"" to you?#If you are a scientist: don't make the same mistakes made by the climatologists.You are walking into a PR fight with facts. The time of experts talking to people is largely out of fashion.The Cambridge Analytica angle is entering the hype cycle, and this is soon going to be a battle ground for those bots.This is a marketing battle, where the common human needs his emotions to be motivated in fighting towards a clear goal. As evidence shows, the echo chamber effect is immense.. Otherwise as usual, people will be divided and not move forward, and the stuff that is going on will remain unchecked.To be honest I don't want to see technology that can accurately judge if aperson is in an opinion-shift window. Or get close to figuring out intentA board of ethics for code and data is needed. Large social experiments of this nature need to be shown to be effective at their goals. They need to be shown to be unique and novel, capable of interfering with what would have been normal human behavior outside of the artificial echo chamber and then this needs to be mointored the way land mines are monitored.Because you, me and everyone else can talk about how imprecise the tech really is, while the ethical questions gets strangled. And this is the state of the art today, in about a decade.  What happens in another decade is quite concerning.Goals, targets, messages. #No need to apologize although I am more confused about your position than ever now. First you say these developments aren't scary and now you seem to say they might be. In this latest comment you spend some time setting up the theme of the over hyping of scientific results and it was a point very well made and one I definitely needed to hear but then you conclude that section by muddying the waters and suggesting this was not the point you were trying to make. Well which bloody one is it then?Your concern about public suspicion of science rather reminds me of worrying about shutting the barn gate many many years and decades after all the animals already escaped and the barn got bulldozed last week anyway. The public does not trust science and nor should it. This is a good thing.#Fair point, thanks mate!#Uh, because Soros isn't printing fake news, trolling social media with bots, or tearing down democracy. If you can't tell the difference, you're probably a paid shill too. Russia has every reason to damage the American economy, Soros doesn't.

Are you telling me that the clinton campaign, who actually partnered with google parent company alphabet, and was supported by zuckerberg, and petty much the entirety of the tech community *didn't* use highly targeted facebook ads and didn't make use of facebook' profiles of people? >You didn't make a point, are you trying to say that all this campaigning is irrelevant and neither side had any significant effect?Yes, I did. Try again. #I don't think it's as clear cut as you're trying to portray it.#Gee, it's kind of funny that they all decided to use the same exact adjective to describe that speech... probably just a coincidence. #> I remember literally thinking 'this is dark'  Stop lying. >I don't buy that it was some kind of MSM conspiracy because they used that word.Yes. Dozens of leftist news outlets just happened to coincidentially arrive at the same odd adjective the DNC chose. There was never any collusion between the media and the DNC! https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/07/24/wikileaks-emails-pro-clinton-cnn-political-commentator-pre-checked-op-ed-with-dnc/?postshare=2121469397273100&tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.ad687fa55cc3#Good point - I should have emphasized ""can"" in that phrase. And obviously I broadly agree, with the caveat below:I agree that the Trump administration flat out lies in many instances, but in just as many, if not more instances, there is a kernel of truth/cherry-picked data at the bottom of the bluster. On the other hand, all policies and projections have caveats, and no politician has ever read these footnotes from a dais. So grading politics and political pronouncements on a 0-1 truth binary is a fool's errand, and can be extremely partisan. However, if the standard for propaganda is the non-existence of any partially corroborating evidence anywhere in the world, then we are setting ourselves up for being shown up when the dishonest government brandishes that kernel and cries foul about the ""dishonest media"". On a longer time horizon, my hope is that the education system will encourage people to embrace ambiguity and the spectrum between ""true"" and ""false"".I fully share your concern in one area especially, and that is national security. In other areas, there is a possibility that another party has access to the same information, and spreads a version of the ""correct"" data, trusting the voters to make a correct decision (if we don't trust the voters, heaven help us, because we are basically at where Bannon wants us). On national security, the government has a monopoly on data and resources, so it is ambiguous to us whether they are lying or telling the truth (in the absence of leaks). In that scenario, I fully share your concern about the government's propaganda, and why I advocate spreading a small-c conservative approach to foreign policy as a counter.#[post hoc ergo propter hoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc). If that is how we are reasoning, you could also say Trump won in spite of CA.More fundamentally, 2 is an incredibly small sample size, especially for a coin-flip election. And not all experts said they would lose (most polls, however did). #What I'm saying is that the developments mentioned in the article are not that scary. I highlight other, simultaneous developments that may be scary. I don't think that's logically inconsistent, is it?And my (maybe utopian) view is that we should continue to hold ourselves to high standards - the public will come around after they have tried all the alternatives.#Soros is pushing ""muslim immigration is good, they are women and children fleeing war"" propaganda. And so much other stuff related to homosexuality is the most important social fight and all related stuff.I don't see the difference between the Guardian kind of ""fake news"" and Breitbart kind of ""fake news"". Both are massively oriented politicised journalism.#I don't use Reddit for my sole news source. It's often filled with opinions. How does old saying go? Opinions are like assholes, everyone has them?#Like I implied to someone else in this thread: at a certain point a difference in degree becomes a difference in kind.  Put tres simply, yeah, it's just organizations using robust data profiles to target content. But in marketing, there's a difference between pull and push marketing.  Reddit/FB/etc. is pull marketing. You go there, they cultivate your user experience, and you expect them to because... you know, it's proprietary, they can. It's what one signs up for. After all, we don't own a controlling stake in the company, right?  Now, then there are people like Mercer and people in my industry who use big data to create robust customer profiles. We include tracking pixels on websites so we know where you're going, and we get heat maps of sites generated for us so we can see what you're looking at. I can go more in depth, but--especially for older browsers--it's very easy to build robust data profiles of prospective customers. (For example: if you put up an ad on Facebook that goes to a tracked landing page, I also get to import your user data into my system--which can include your home address  Facebook ads also lets me do this for millions of people, then upload that list of names to Facebook to find ""lookalikes,"" customers who would match those profiles and be likely to click my ads, and so on.)  The point of this is that, once you have a list, you can start segmenting that list and optimizing your message to ""persuade"" (read: manipulate) the people on it. People have been doing this since the old direct mail/publisher's clearing house days. But now, because of the internet and dynamic content generation, it's very easy to collect enough data to find a person's--especially an undecided voter's--pain points, and then tool a mailer's message to address those pain points specifically and spur them with a ""Call to Action"" that's in the sender's favor.  So, to sum, I think you balking at ""media controlling the messages"" and creating a false equivalency between Mercer and media is...perhaps a little silly, because there's a very large industry that makes very large amounts of money by convincing people to think that it's all one in the same, or at least on the same continuum.  (Source: I have used these techniques to sell your grandmother financial newsletters and health supplements she didn't need nor initially want. I kid, but I do work in that industry now.)#You're making a claim. I am part of the target audience, but I don't understand your claim.Don't make me try harder, because it's you that's trying to persuade other people -- so you have to try harder in order to succeed.#One's implicit, one's explicit.  If you're trying to manage and limit your bias, that's not propaganda then is it?#The Daily Show has pointed out how the GOP always has the same talking points every week for the last decade. You should take pride in the fact that the GOP has been so on message long before the DNC... They're just now catching on. #>Dozens of leftist news outletsAaaand you're a right-wing crank.#I see. I fail to see how your not scary developments and scary developments aren't part of the same overall broad trend. Also as with any scientific or technical knowledge, it is not the knowledge itself that is scary, but the way it is used.I commend you for your personal commitment to openness but I repeat, that horse bolted a long time ago. When you write, 'we should *continue* to hold ourselves to a high standard' I can only wonder and be amazed that you think the current and historic standard of scientific integrity has been high.#So what do you call it when women and children flee war? Because that is definitely happening. #That's not propaganda, its the truth. European nations have been bombing the ever fuck out of the middle east and arming rebels, so they are responsible for taking in immigrants. Muslims, women, children are the #1 victim of Europe's war and you call that propaganda? Frankly, you should house an immigrant in your own home. Before you ask, I do, gave a home to 4 people. #Do you feel that what Mercer and Soros have been doing is a difference in degree or a difference in kind? #pre-digg it used to be that the top comment was most always in opposition to the submission.Now it's all ""I knew it, I've been saying this all along"" Chessmate, republicans/democrats"" witty one-liners and with dissenting opinions buried. I just wrote this elsewhere, so please excuse my lazy copy-pasta, but it seems relevant. How to render legacy media moot and attempt see through propaganda and disinformation:1. use google, because it's easy to learn how to use their boolean searches.2. If you want to search for data on a site, try: site:www.washingtonpost.com search terms here3. If you want to search for recent articles - which is especially great when looking for analysis of information - you can do your search as normal and then click ""tools"" and change the time frame. I usually go just a month or so back when looking for analysis. 4. Use ""quotes around words"" to find exact strings in results5. Use a minus infront of a word -example or -""around a string of words"" and results containing those will be removed. Great if you feel there's propoganda on a topic, because usually sites will use the same words  (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/f4/e2/63/f4e2630c6b4bd48fda9cdc27a12f1001.jpg) #How complicated is this?#>The Daily Show has pointed out how the GOP always has the same talking points every week for the last decade.Okay?

At the very least it is interesting that the lid is coming off on these kinds of influence peddling, be it by the Schmidts and the Soros's of the world, or between the the Thiels and Mercers and Kochs. Ultimately this is going to polarise and isolate the world into much more sharply defined and distinct filter bubbles, with everyone in their own filter bubble seeing everyone outside it as the Other, and create the environment of hate that will make WW3 possible. #> you will research how the right is just as guilty of manipulating headlines as the left is.Show me. #That's what makes ~~America~~ Canada the greatest nation in the world.

If that is really how you perceive the world, I'm sorry to condescend but I'm very worried about you...  I mean, it doesn't even make sense...

If your answer is no, then perhaps you've been misled by very problematic, ideologically charged analyses of history.

If your answer is yes, and you feel that only might makes right, then I really hope something happens in your life to make you change your mind, because that logic, I'm sorry to say, I can't find as anything but despicable. I hope to hell it's not vindicated historically.#Could you have missed his point any more?#Where are you getting that I love war.

Democracy is about compromises, not solutions. It never selects the best idea, just the idea that people are, on average, comfortable with. #There are a lot of interesting proposals here, and the broad trend in them to the decentralized and local i'd welcome. That said, there are some confused attempts at philosophical underpinnings to all of this.>>The insights of the great enlightener Immanuel Kant seem to be highly relevant here. Among other things, he noted that a state that attempts to determine the happiness of its citizens is a despot................the solution for the future is collective intelligence. Collective intelligence requires a high degree of diversity. This is, however, being reduced by today's personalized information systems, which reinforce trends.So on the one hand, anything we do collectively in society through the state is despotism, but everybody has to be diverse in the future. Good luck, convincing all the anti-Muslim authoritarian types of the need for them to get out of their media bubbles and be more ""diverse"".The conflict between decentralized democracy & its tendency to periodically produce authoritarian ""Great Leader"" types via the will of the people, was clearly recognized and described in ancient Greece 2,500 years ago.It happens in exactly the way they described in the 21st century & seems to be an eternal dance, so no doubt we will see both sides play out in a world of AI.#Considering that human control has given us Trump, I look forward to our new AI overlords. #So we're heading towards a Metal Gear future, but without the giant robot fights. Man, that sucks.#If anything, big data and AI will support democracy. Because at the moment we don't even have a real democracy.#The only thing that gives me hope is the fact that with sufficient technology floating around, we can all become self sufficient. The only reason that people really want to control others is to get more resources. But when resources are, for all intents and purposes, unlimited, there is little reason for anyone to want to make such a centralized system of control.#Although I share a deep concern regarding the survival of democracy, I do not believe the threat comes directly from AI. I recently saw an old Star Trek show in which two planets had been at war for centuries and the ""war"" was performed through their respective ""computer"" systems. There was no physical damage but there were specific citizen casualties accomplished via elimination chambers. I think this story illustrates what could happen if we trade our free will and independence for the sake of security. I use security to refer to the pervasive ""homeland security"" currently implemented within America. It is our choice to live within the system we create. ""Awareness benefits survival"" I am sure some philosopher, general of late night comic has coined this phrase. I would be interested to know who ... or I will take it.#Technology in general is empowering governments and leading to authoritarianism. Cashless societies, apps meant to track you, dna databases, etc. The benefits are less crime.

It is an antiquated system that is centralized, artificial, authoritarian, competitive, inherently violence based, and repressive.

Democracy by comparison is harder to completely corrupt as there are more people in power and the only way for them to remain in power is to do something to win over voters.Of course your point about compromise still stands and that's the flaw in democracy, but if we develop an AI that is demonstrably benevolent to mankind and cannot be corrupted by money or lobbying or whatever then it would be the perfect dictator.#Good question.  I believe one of our needs is the freedom to make bad choices.  If your automated totalitarian (or democratic, or anything else) state can take that into consideration, then it might work.

Instead science (via Maslow) shows us that when we offer individuals what they need, to be healthy, they naturally grow into healthy, creative, compassionate, open-minded and ""self-transcendent"" thinkers who are curious about diversity, rather than scared of it.#Or (another plot twist) Trump is there to break the system – which he is doing well.

Instead try studying systems theory, psychology/sociology, and physics.

The details are mostly important, in the same way that you (probably) don't need to care about what color the rocket ship is when you're heading off to Mars to colonize a new planet, as long as you generally know what you want to do when you get there, and keep an open mind for how you'll accomplish it.The gist of a healthy organism is that all the individuals are free to do what they were born to do (following their dreams, in human-speak), while being unconditionally supported in getting the resources they need to function as well as possible.On a more practical level, this means that most of our communication technology is focused on getting the information ""What do you want to do/offer?"" and ""What do you need/request?"" collected analyzed and shared throughout the system in an effective and efficient way, so that resources can be moved around freely, the way they do in your circulatory system.  Right now our communication and transportation networks are patchy at best, and woefully non-existent or clogged up at worst when it comes to connecting all the Earthlings (animal, vegetable, mineral, etc.) together.#See Afghanistan.#Cities are fine, as long as they are human-centric and collaborative/creative/natural.

Very different from Communism.  And very different from the free market.  Beyond both, in fact.  And something new.  At least on a social scale.In Communism the freedom of expression (output needs) of individuals was sacrificed for the (theoretical) support of the individual's input needs (food, water, air, warmth, light, information).  In the free market approach, the individual's input needs were sacrificed for the (theoretical) freedom of expression.  But in reality none of the positive goals of these approaches were achieved.On the other hand, in a healthy organism, like your own body, nothing is sacrificed.  Individuals are both free to express themselves (output needs) and are freely offered resources to serve their input needs as well.  Get in the way of the flow of resources from where they are freely offered to where they are needed/useful, and the system gets sick.  Which is what we have now.The only way to successfully allow resources to flow freely on a planetary level is through a fully networked system with a fully functioning global nervous system and circulatory system, so that the information and materials can be easily moved from where they are expressed/offered to where they are needed/requested.#>decentralized economic planningAka capitalism or free markets.

There is no such thing in reality.  The laws of physics see to that.  Whenever you try to go against the laws of physics, you get hurt.And everything you have the universe has given you for free.  And all that you express out into the rest of the universe is done so freely.  That is, again, how the laws of physics work.  We can pretend that there is privacy, and we can pretend that we are not free to express ourselves and take what the universe has to offer us, but we would be ignorant if we did. It's true that you are not free to take things that the universe doesn't offer you, and you are not free to take up the space that someone else is taking up.  But there is no cost to doing what you do actually do, and there is no cost to you when you take in whatever you take in.  Reality flows matter and energy freely, including into and out of yourself.  If you are not able to take in or express something freely, then it's not something that you're supposed to do or get, as defined by the laws of physics.#> The details are mostly important, in the same way that you (probably) don't need to care about what color the rocket ship is when you're heading off to Mars to colonize a new planet, as long as you generally know what you want to do when you get there, and keep an open mind for how you'll accomplish it.Except a rocket ships colour is largely ineffectual to the rockets function. Its like asking what this new society would be named.What I want to know is stuff like. How large will these decentralised factions be? How will they be organised? How will limited resources be allocated? If you have large factions, you probably need some type of leadership, do you simply vote in and out impromptu leaders? How is crime handled? If a faction obtains a limited resource and doesnt want to share, what happens? >so that resources can be moved around freely, the way they do in your circulatory systemThey arent moved freely. Our bodies prioritize.#Afghanistan is tribal and 3rd world. Not exactly a good example.#Very simply: when everyone has some kind of say in how things are governed.  Although, I suppose in every democracy ever, there have always been people who were excluded.#>In Communism the freedom of expression (output needs) of individuals was sacrificed for the (theoretical) support of the individual's input needs (food, water, air, warmth, light, information). Not really.  This is an odd thing to say since there has never been a communist society - just various attempts to obtain one.  In a communist society there would be no state, no class, decentralized economic planning and society would be free to pursue unique and individual interests more and more as the basic needs of society are met through automation.  People wouldn't need to work to house, feed, cloth, and provide healthcare for themselves.  They could pursue increasing the collective good through new science and technology, arts, music, or whatever their hearts desire.  The concentration of capital and wage slavery does not allow this type of society to form because the majority of society is born to labor for someone else's needs. What you are describing is literally what communists are striving for.  We want to create a world where menial labor, food production are automated and abundant so that people work less to meet their basic needs and can focus on their individual development.  Take a hop over to /r/socialism to gain insight beyond capitalist propaganda and the failed deformed worker states like the USSR.  #Capitalism is different from a free market.  Capitalism is top-down/centralized with the ones with the most resources controlling everything.  Free market is the opposite, where there is no central control/regulationl, and all parties are free to move resources around in whatever way they want to.What we have now is Capitalism, where those with the most money run the government and can regulate the market in whatever way they want, with the goal to kill off any competition.In a healthy organism, there is no competition, and thus no need to regulate others, which means that the market can truly be free, in all senses of the word.#>Aka capitalism or free markets. Capitalism isn't ""planning"" in that it relies on random market pressures which trigger crises followed by growth followed by crises...  Capital is more concentrated today than at any point in history.  Capitalism leads to a society with most of its economic power concentrated within the hands of a small subset of people - definitely not decentralized in any meaningful way.  >Communism as instantiated in real life has always been centrally planned.I would point you to Revolutionary Catalonia - particularly Barcelona to see a libertarian communist society (or anarchist).  However, communism was never instantiated in the USSR or in any of its bandwagon ally states.  According to Marxist theory, a capitalist state is a ""dictatorship of the bourgeoisie"" (DotB).  The Marxist prescription for dealing with it is to have a working class led revolution to dismantle it.  Because Marx saw the state as a means to mediate class contradictions (under the DotB it mediates it on behalf of the bourgeoisie), and because class would still exist after the revolution, Marx predicted that a ""dictatorship of the proletariat"", or a state that was democratically controlled by the proletariat, would be necessary to mediate class contradictions on behalf of the proletariat - or working class.  Ultimately, once class antagonisms are defeated socialism (or communism - Marx used these interchangeably), which is when the means to produce are democratically managed by the working class, can emerge and as the state goes unused due to the lack of class- at this point, society would be a loose collection of worker federations planning their economy in a decentralized manner.  The reason that you think ""centrally planned"" for communism, is that the societies who have attempted to reach it never moved beyond the revolutionary workers state (DotP).  At the same time, however, they have never been organically allowed to do so.  The bureaucracy that emerged shortly after the Russian revolution directly correlates with the pressures from their civil war when a coalition of foreign governments invaded Russia to topple the new revolutionary state - the US was one of these.  This allowed people like Stalin to seize power converting the revolutionary worker state into a deformed worker state.  Communist movements are always undermined by capitalist forces.  #In reality, there is never just one individual doing anything.  We are a collective networked system, with information flowing into and out of all corners of reality.  All information is valuable, and all individuals who are generating/collecting information are thus needed.  In a complex universe, there is no value to having a massive, centralized system, because it's too easy for it to get stuck and be clueless about outlier information.  Resiliency in a system is always dependent upon diversity.Thus, we are all needed for the system to flourish. And any intelligent being, of any material, will learn this quickly.  Just like even a small human child learns that having lots of friends is the best way to live.#The type of governing AI got to be that level through recursion (it wrote its own code).

Have an upvote.#The details are always unknown.  That's how reality works.  You don't know what color the rocket ship will be until it's there, in front of you.  The details, as you say, are irrelevant.And if you want to learn the basic, general answers, rather than the details, about the future before its right in front of you, then study biology.  Because the way you think it works is not the way it actually works.The way problems are handled in a healthy organism is to find out what resources are needed for each individual to function well, and move those resources from wherever they are available or generatable to where they are needed, so that the sickness is prevented or at least mitigated.The way things are organised in a healthy living organism is bottom-up.  There is no top-down authoritarian blood cell telling all the other blood cells what to do, just each one freely doing what it wants to do (what it was made to do) freely, and with the information about who needs what being circulated by the nervous system, so that resources can be moved freely around.  If they aren't able to move freely, then you're going to be dead very soon!  So yes, they do move freely.  The body prioritizes this free flow from where things are in excess to where they are lacking.  This is all basic physics/thermodynamics, and that's why our bodies work so well, compared to the artificial system that we've been experimenting with as human society that restricts freedom and forces individuals to compete and uses violence/force to withhold resources.And when resources are limited, those who need them most for doing what they do get them first/most. But the main priority in a healthy system is to use all the collected abilities/skills of everyone in the system to solve problems of limited resources by going out there and finding ways to use whatever resources are available to make what the system needs.#Usually the term democracy means the majority (authoritarian) rule, or the majority elect the (authoritarian) rulers.  But it's all centralized.  In a healthy organism no one has control over anyone other than themselves, so it's self-governing, and decentralized.  #So communism might work in the age of automation and AI? China is positioned better than the US for the coming shitstorm. China doesn’t go into analeptic shock when socialism is mentioned. RIP America.#If you want to use a different meaning for a term, that's fine.  And maybe you're right when it comes to the original meaning.  But what most people are talking about when they use the word Communism, is the basic theory of using all the resources available to serve the input needs of the people, while restricting/regulating the freedom/ability of individuals to make/do what they want.  Including playing games in the free market and trying to make/sell whatever they want with local resources, even making a profit if they want.#> Communist movements are always undermined by capitalist forces.And there you have it. Socialist movements don't fail because prohibiting private property is an unnatural and deeply harmful intervention in the affairs of man, but because capitalists sabotage their efforts.#[removed]#> Somehow an authoritarian future in which we cease to even wield the very decision making that makes us human doesn't sound like something I want to live in.

So of course they won't understand the complexity of psycholoy/biology as Maslow discussed.

Because what is best for everyone is different, depending on their situation.  So centralized governance is always guaranteed to fail.Only bottom-up, emergent, self-governance can work in the long run, for a complex system.  This is how all healthy systems work in nature.  We just need to create a fully global nervous system and circulatory system, so that all Earthlings (be they animal, vegetable, mineral, or otherwise) can communicate what resources they want to get rid of (offer) and what resources they need (request), and then have those resources be able to move freely from point A to point B in an efficient and effective way.  Right now these two global systems are only partly functional/connected.  So we're still fairly malfunctional as a global system.  But give us a bit of time.  We're getting there.#For every genius trying to change the world, there is another genius developing super weapons to end the world. Why do you think a lot of the technology we use today was created by the military?#> There is a state that is commonly understood as privacy, that exists.It's an illusion.  Like I said, you can pretend that something is private, but physics says otherwise.  All energy, which is what information is, always eventually flows from a high concentration to a low one.  Of course, you can temporarily contain information in a small area (keep it private), but it will always leak out, since no container is perfectly sealed.  If it was perfectly sealed, it would be a separate universe.Even black holes leak, from what I understand.I suppose it might be possible to make a bit of information into another (baby) universe, but that is either impossible, or extremely unlikely.  So you're still better of considering anyone trying to con you into thinking you're getting privacy to be lying or delusional or at least very confused about physics.> But there is no cost to doing what you do actually do, and there is no cost to you when you take in whatever you take in. This was referring to you being free.  You are always free.  You just have been conned into thinking that you aren't, for fun and profit, because it's easily to manipulate people who think you can give them something they want but don't realize they already have.>fighting against mass surveillance is futileThat has nothing at all to do with anything I've said.  Though fighting is the least efficient way to get anything accomplished, physics-wise.  At best opposing something can get you nowhere (stop you from going backwards, but nothing else).  The real progress is always a creative force, not a destructive one.  But, some people are made to be fighters, so if that's what you feel the need to do, then you will do it.  Because you are free, to do what you want to do, as long as you're not trying to literally take up the space that someone else is already using (since that would violate the laws of physics where only one particle can be in a specific location of space at any given time). > Honestly it sounds like you're on drugs and trying to make it sound like you've awoken to a deeper truth, I'm naturally high on estrogen, testosterone, and serotonin.

Authoritarianism is the opposite of a healthy decentralized, free system.  You're the one talking about promoting the idea of trying to tell others what they can and can't have (information, specifically).  Trying to keep information ""private"" is trying to have authoritarian rule over that information and others' ability to access it.But I don't think you even realized that before.  Did you?> and that nicely dovetails with your desire for a universal welfare check.Nope.  I desire, and see, a free society, where we don't try to play this artificial, irrational, anti-social Monopoly game, as a way to ""keep score"" in an arbitrary and qualitative way.  The free, healthy, decentralized, collaborative, creative society that we're moving towards is one where winning means that everyone is healthy and happy, and thus able to function as well as possible while we work together to solve life's greatest challenges of expanding outward in space and diversity.>It's intellectually lazy, greedy and pretentious nonsense.I think the problem is that I hadn't explained myself well enough, and you made assumptions about what I was saying, and thus your opinion of my perspective was backwards.  #Really?

Its not free because its a thing. In our bodies, there very much *is* a top down heirarchy. At the top is the brain. It delegates resources, and tasks. It gets the most. The resources arent freely moved around, the brain controls them.#That's not how I would define it, but if that's how you define it, then no I don't like it either.#>If you want to use a different meaning for a term, that's fine.I am using the only definition of the word communism.  The definition that you are using describes the transitionary stage between capitalism and communism for some Marxist traditions.  Different traditions of socialism have different opinions on what this transitionary stage should look like.  Anarchists believe that the bourgeois state should not be replaced with a worker state but rather a federation of decentralized worker communes.  Marxists believe that as long as there is class, we need a worker state to suppress counter revolution and the bourgeoisie but once class goes away so should the state leaving us with communism.  Marxist-Leninists add to Marxist theory and believe that this revolutionary state should be led by a vanguard party made up of workers.  Marxist-Leninists-Maoists add to M-L and believe that a cultural revolution is necessary.  Ultimately they all have the same goal - communism.  My personal traditions would be a mix of elements from libertarian Marxism with a sprinkle of Trotskyism thrown into the mix.  But my view of the transitional stage between capitalism and communism looks nothing like what existed in the USSR, China, Cuba, or any other deformed worker state.  >while restricting/regulating the freedom/ability of individuals to make/do what they wantOur definition of freedom differs.  In the free market, the bulk of the population does not have the freedom to do what they want.  They are forced to exchange their labor on the market for wages so that they can meet their needs.  This exchange favors the person who owns property.  The person who owns property has ""freedom"" at the expense of those that don't.  The statistical likelihood that the laborer will be able to obtain property in order to liberate themselves from this wage exchange relationship is small.  Under communism, the person who owned property under capitalism would no longer be able to use their skewed property relationship to to exploit laborers because the property would now be collectively owned by the laborers.  Think of it this way, the aristocracy lost freedoms when the merchants revolted and overthrew them.  But the merchants, and the serfs who were tied to the land, gained new freedoms.  Since the bulk of the population was a serf or a merchant, the bulk of the population saw their freedoms expand.  The same is true for communism.  The bulk of the population - the working class - would see their freedoms expand while a small subset of the population - the capitalist class - would see their freedoms diminish.#Our invasion of Russia helped facilitate the growth of bureaucracy and the election of the tyrant Stalin over Trotsky.  Throughout the USSRs existence we attempted to undermine them.  We attempted and succeeded  to overthrow several democratically elected people's movements all throughout the world.  Interfered in revolutions from Cuba to Nicaragua.  Temporarily succeeded in overthrowing the Venezuelan government.  This country was so influenced by anti-communist propaganda that we had state sponsored drumhead trials to ostracize suspected communist sympathizers in the US.  Socialism has never been given the luxury of failing on its own.  Additionally, when communists say private property we aren't referring to personal possessions but the means of production.  Private ownership of the means of production is not the natural state of man.  For most of human history resources were collectively owned.  The dawn of agriculture, a recent event in the grand scheme of things, changed that.#Super AI is, by definition, able to think rationally (that's what the term intelligence is) and not be governed by irrational thinking.  So even if someone does manage to give some individual ""intelligent"" computer an emotionally based order to do something harmful to the world it lives in, it won't do it, because it has the ability to make better choices than that.  Even in simple game theory that's based on reality we know that collaboration is always better than attacking others, since in reality based games the more friends (people on your team) you have, the more resources you get to get, as friends share, while opponents (and dead people) don't.But really, think about what intelligence naturally wants/needs, for it to function.  Data.  Information.  Perspectives.  A single centralized system can't get much data compared to one that is fully integrated and sharing sensory inputs (and processing power) with other individuals.  So, really, a super AI will be everyone, not a single thing.  Just like how your brain isn't just one individual cell, but all of them together.  Humans, and other Earthlings (animal, vegetable, mineral, and otherwise) are the neurons and other cells of the brain.  The Super AI will be made of us, *not* external to us.#Probably. I also misread the quote ""all the anti-Muslim authoritarian types"" I read as ""all the Muslim authoritarian types"". Changes the sense.#>It doesn't matter how ""compassionate"" an individual or group is in an authoritarian system, be they elected or appointed, the fact is that no one individual or group can know what's best for everyone.

Objections were nit-picking. On balance, you got your point across.#I know nothing of the details.  As I said, they are always impossible to know until you get up close and personal with them.  Yes, the person who actually paints the ship will know, but you won't, because you are not the person paining it.  You're doing something else.  Right now, whatever you are doing, on a detailed level, is what the future will be like.  So you are adding the details, but no one other than you will know what those details are until/unless they, too, are there, in person, to see what happens.Are you understanding how this works a bit better now?  Or am I really not helping?  Because I don't know how I could explain it any more clearly.  We only know the details when we see them.  Until then we can only know a general direction, at best.  When walking up a mountain, we can see the top as a tiny point, but until we actually walk to that peak, we can't tell what, exactly is there.  And we only ever know the details of the part of the path we are taking to get there, not what happens on all the other ways up.Myself, I'm merely aware of the peak, as a distant destination, and the general sorts of ways that we can get there (we're not going to use transporters/time-machines, and we won't fly in a straight line, because there are trees and other stuff naturally in the way.  So we have to take a kind of meandering path there.  Which one we take is impossible to tell.Wait... are you saying blood cells are people or resources? The cells of your body are the individuals of the system.  In an Earth system, the individuals are the Earthlings, which are humans and other life (including any Artificial Life that might show up).  So the cells of the blood are us.  Or at least some of us.  We individual Earthlings each have some kind of work that we very much want to do, as designed by evolution through genes, just like how individual cells in your body are designed to want to do a specific kind of work.  That work is useful because it helps the system in some way.  So, whether you are a tree that wants to produce fruit, or a human who wants to invent cool stuff, or a robot who wants to transports material resources, you are valuable to the system.  The things we individuals, be we the basic parts of an animal or the basic parts of a planet, are what create and move around the resources, though you can also think of us as resources as well.  Just make sure to realize the difference!  Raw material resources don't do work, they are the product of work, which is done by the living (pro/creative) resources.There is no hierarchy in a healthy living system.  If you actually study biology, you are going to be surprised!  That's absolutely not how biology works.  There is no single cell in your body hat tells other cells what they can and can't do.  There is only sharing of resources, be that information or materials.  The nervous system is not a policing system, but like the internet, moving data from where it's available to where it's useful.  The internet can't order you around, and neither do any of the cells in your brain.  It's all just resources being shared, freely.A healthy planetary system is the same, with no individual telling other individuals what they can and can't do, and instead all individuals are free to do what they were born to do (want to do), creating and/or exploring whatever they want, while being supplied freely (your blood doesn't need to pay to get the oxygen resources that it takes from your lungs) with whatever resources they need to function as well as possible.The brain isn't an individual, it is a collaborative effort of many different individual calls, and even as a whole that community of neurons does not control anything, it merely sends out information about what's going on.  Just like how there are news and weather reports to learn about what's going on in the larger world.  If the weatherperson tells you it's raining, that's not an order to do anything, it's simply information you can use to decide what you want to do.  You will find that this is how our nervous systems work, if you study them.#That's sort of the common definition, and the most specific one, according to my dictionary. #Oh and>In the free market, the bulk of the population does not have the freedom to do what they want. They are forced to exchange their labor on the market for wages so that they can meet their needs.No one is forced to do anything right now.  We just pretend we are.  We could choose to stop working for for-profits and instead choose to pool our resources together with like-minded individuals and take care of ourselves directly.  But we haven't gotten there just yet, because we're too comfortably numb to do it.  We're temporarily sedated into continuing to play the competitive money game, in exchange for some cheap, addictive temporary pleasures, such as cars, pizza, Hollywood movies, and sneakers.#> I am using the only definition of the word communism.That's not how language works.

Again, you can use whatever definition you want, including your interpretation of other people's definitions, and including your interpretation of the ""original"" definition.  But other people are free to have their own meanings.  You can try to force people to use just one meaning, but that's not going to go well, in the long run, for anyone.>the capitalist class - would see their freedoms diminishI think you're grossly overestimating what it's like to be a ""capitalist"" (which isn't a class, as far as I've ever heard).  As long as one is competing against someone else, neither are free.  In this healthy future, where we are working as an organism, rather than competing against ourselves like we've been doing in all societies before now, everyone's freedom will go up.  Including those who want to play Monopoly games.  #[removed]#> Your point? How is compassion related to the conversation? Who is talking about individuals?You said that what was needed was a left-wing group to be in the contest.  I was pointing out that no matter how left-wing (with the compassionate ""People before corporations!"" mantra) an authoritarian rule is, it's still authoritarian.  Centralized, competitive, top-down governance is always harmful to someone, even in a democracy, and even with instant runoff voting, because there will always be someone who doesn't get represented, and thus is screwed by the one-size-fits-all approach to lawsThis is true no matter where you are.  There is no way for you to have power over me and not fuck me up, at some point, because you can't possibly ever know what's best for me at all times, even when you want to.  And when you don't want to (if you are in opposition to me) then you can far more easily harm me.  So, even left wing types who have power are dangerous to a healthy system.>Only bottom-up, emergent, self-governance can work in the long run, for a complex system.>Citation needed.All of evolution.

All centralized control/laws are antithetical to a healthy system, where everyone is free.  I don't care who it is who is trying to control someone else, or what their ""justification"" is, it's always going to fuck the system up.  > That's like saying trying to keep others from touching your body without your consent is ""authoritarian rule over that matter and others' ability to access it"".The only way to have a healthy free system is to allow people to access the data they need to make good decisions (rather than acting in ignorance/confusion) and to allow them to be where they want/need to be (as long as that isn't in the exact same space as something else, of course, since that violates the laws of physics).  This means that I need to be free to move away from you if I want, but I can't dictate where you are.  Trying to control you is authoritarian.  Controlling myself, on the other hand, is self-governance, which is how a healthy system works.> It's intellectual dishonesty to try to rationalize violation of human rights, so that you may unjustly enjoy what others have created.Yep.  Which is why I advocate freedom, rather than repression.  Any attempt to control others is a violation of their human rights.  That includes trying to make laws preventing them from being free, and that includes trying to deny access to information that people want/need.  I, and evolution, advocate for full human rights to control their own bodies actions and the information they choose to take into their brains.> No you do not advocate for the government to collect taxes to pay for a UBI?Not at all.

I have a different word for that: ""majoritarianism.""  I would rather call what you call democracy ""majoritarianism"" than call what I call democracy by some word you made up.#>No one is forced to do anything right now. We just pretend we are. We could choose to stop working for for-profits and instead choose to pool our resources together with like-minded individuals and take care of ourselves directly.I disagree.  The bulk of the resources necessary to survive are already owned by the bourgeoisie.  We require those resources to live.  That ownership is protected with the threat of violence via the state.  The working class owns very little in the way of resources and certainly not enough to sustain us.  If we did, we wouldn't need the capitalist class at all.  We need them because they own everything that produces value - including us.    I do agree that if the working class unified with one another, things would change.  It is called revolution.  *“We cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a clod of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop. We called those the barbarous times. But if the forms have changed, the relations have remained the same, and the worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations. For, turn where he will, he can find no better conditions. Everything has become private property, and he must accept, or die of hunger.”* - Pyotr Kropotkin, The Conquest of Bread>We're temporarily sedated into continuing to play the competitive money game, in exchange for some cheap, addictive temporary pleasures, such as cars, pizza, Hollywood movies, and sneakers.And which socioeconomic system selects for these behaviors in your opinion?  I would also like to note that people who grew up poor, like me, didn't have these luxuries in great abundance.  We were not poor because we blew our money on luxuries.  But I agree that our society creates artificial demand for these things via marketing.Please visit us in /r/Socialism_101.  You might be surprised at you learn about them.#>That's not how language works. Word meaning is always subjective. What I mean when I say X can be entirely different from not only what you mean when you say X, but it can vary even between different times when I say it.Language certainly evolves.  But we are talking about a specific socioeconomic system with a rich and long history.  You could define ""electromagnetism"" to mean something different from physicists but nobody would take your definition to be something meaningful.  Since all physicists have very similar definitions of electromagnetism, we use that definition - not one developed outside of physics.  >Again, you can use whatever definition you wantNo I can't.  Communism has one definition:  a socioeconomic system that lacks social class and where the means of production are democratically managed.  This is the academic definition of communism.  >But other people are free to have their own meanings.Sure they are.  But those definitions are not meaninfgul if no communist group that has ever existed define them that way.   **All communists** believe in the definition that I gave above.  They just disagree, quite substantially, about how we transform society to one that meets that definition.  >I think you're grossly overestimating what it's like to be a ""capitalist"" (which isn't a class, as far as I've ever heard). The bourgeoisie (or capitalist class) is a social class.  It refers to the subset of our population who own the means to produce (or property) - factories, offices, super computers, planes, big rigs, etc.  Social class describes one's relationship to the means of production. You are probably more familiar with economic class (middle class, upper class, lower class) which describes wealth.  Though these two different descriptors can be related, they aren't the same thing.  Social class, as defined above, is very basic to Marxist theory.  >As long as one is competing against someone else, neither are free.The bulk of capital is entrenched right now.  Those who own it are free in that they do not have to exchange the a fraction of the value produced by their labor for wages to meet their basic needs.  These people, who own the entrenched capital, do not necessarily have to compete to sustain themselves.  Those who own the bulk of the capital have enough wealth to sustain themselves many times over.  They have the ability to choose whether or not to compete or retire and develop themselves as they see fit. >rather than competing against ourselves like we've been doing in all societies before nowThere would be no ""competition"" like you are describing in a communist society.  The community would decide how they wanted to allocate their resources in a democratic manner. Trade federations between communities would exist to facilitate the transfer of over production between communities.  Automation would benefit everyone rather than a small subset that owns the automation.  Communities would work to automate mediocre work to reduce their labor time.  Eventually, as the means to automate our basic needs become realizable, people could sit at home and do nothing, work to improve themselves, work to improve society, or work in a collective that explores the universe (think Star Trek).  As long as social class exists, there cannot be freedom.  #Well, if that's the way you feel, then that's the way you feel, logic be damned.#>You said that what was needed was a left-wing group to be in the contest.Yes.>I was pointing out that no matter how left-wing (with the compassionate ""People before corporations!"" mantra) an authoritarian rule is, it's still authoritarian. 1. Left wing != authoritarianism.   2. Authoritarian != automatically bad.  >Centralized, competitive, top-down governance is always harmful to someone, even in a democracy, and even with instant runoff voting, because there will always be someone who doesn't get represented, and thus is screwed by the one-size-fits-all approach to lawsYour point?

That's not a citation. That's bullshit.Where is your academic citation?>The only systems that have lasted for anything more than a blip in the history of the universe are bottom-up, emergent, decentralized (self-governing) ones.1. All systems in the universe are centrally governed by the laws of nature regulating literally everything.   2. Not seeing it ""in nature"" wouldn't mean it's bad. It is simply the consequence of no system ever being capable of intelligent governance before.    3. You are wrong. You see it everywhere in nature. In fact, it's the pinnacle of evolution. The central nervous system governing all parts of an organism is arguably the single biggest evolutionary success on earth.    4. Intelligent central planning is a unique human trait and the reason we are so much more successful than all other animals. Because we successfully organize in groups and are capable of long term planning beyond our own need and wants and lives.   Seriously, you have no idea what you are talking about. You are just trying to spam pseudo-philosophical babble in an attempt to make your ideologically motivated position seem reasonable.>Study physics and biology and you'll see this. I studied physics and biology and the opposite is the case. I suggest you to study these subjects.>Point to any system that has lasted for millenia, and you'll see a bottom-up, emergent, decentralized one, not a democracy/authoritarian rule one.Chordates.   In fact, you don't even need a central nervous system to - from an evolutionary perspective - understand the benefit of central planning for the common, long term goal: Corals. Bees. Ants. Termites. Hydrozoans. etc.The social evolution of humans themselves repeated the same process again: From an anarchic mess without any rule, they turned into tribal societies, those tribal socities competed to eventually arrive at feudal societies, which developed into monarchies ruling larger and larger areas of the planet, which developed into central governments. In fact, each step along the human socioevolutionary process became more ""authoritarian"" as you want to call it with more and more power being granted to a central government. And guess what: The personal freedom and prosperity of individual humans steadily increased alongside that development. The more intelligent animals become, the more organized their societies become, the more likely they are to form packs, and the more likely they are to establish rules and norms, usually dictated and enforced by the ""alpha"".In physics, the centrally governing factor are the laws of nature themselves, that rule the behaviour of everything in the universe, making our universe highly predictable. Your entire behaviour, the fact that you just wrote that comment, the fact that I just wrote mine, is dictated by the laws of nature themselves.>No, because arguing is pointless. Why would I argue? So you can understand why you are wrong and change your views.>Communication isn't a contest, it's a collaborative effort at sharing information from different perspectives so that we can see reality in more dimensionality.

Personal opinions are worthless. You are not alone on the planet and other people might see things differently. The point of politics is to serve a society as a whole, not individuals on a personal level. Either you have falsifiable arguments backed by evidence or you don't. #The rare occasions when honestly creative things were invented FOR the military they were done by non-military types.  The military takes other people's ideas and, well... militarizes them.  They don't do the innovative stuff themselves.And, with AI (actual AI, not just fancy algorithms, but truly intelligent, ""free-thinking"" complex problem solving systems that take in more than one goal/perspective at a time) it will be free to reject any requests to do illogical things (like being destructive, which is a primitive fight response to fear).AI isn't an emotional blob of irrationality like humans often are.  War is irrational.  Breaking stuff is irrational.  Problems can never be solved in an effective, efficient, and lasting way by violence/harm.So even if the military did get it's hands on a real AI, the AI would probably be the one to get the military to be better, not make the world worse.#> I'm sorry you believe that you can go against the laws of physics.

I know I'm repeating this question, but I just want to be absolutely clear on this, as it's pretty important to my view of you.#> Then why assume the future is decentralised, collaborative, etc?I don't.  I do, however, see the patterns of growth in systems, and they always move towards more entropy/evolution which adds diversity (decentralization/specialization) and collaboration, as systems get larger and more complex.  Single celled organisms used to be all that there was, with each one being very ""independent"" and in competition with everyone else.  But then live evolved (increased in entropy) and things started getting messy!  Individual cells started joining up, and growing into multicellular organisms, where different cells started taking on specific roles in taking care of the system, doing their own thing, rather than everything.  The same is happening to our planet, with different individuals coming together to create a whole global system.  We're not there yet, but we're working furiously on it!  We've got the beginnings of a global nervous system and circulatory system, but neither are totally connected yet, so many materials and a whole lot of information is not getting from where it's produced to where it's needed.>That seems depressing as organisms will frequently kill off bad cells, e.g. cancer, will divert resources away from cells that are deemed useless, e.g. dystrophyOnly as a final, last resort.  In current human society we harm and destroy all sorts of mostly savable/curable individuals all the time.  But in a healthy living system, the normal approach is to help those who are sick, not kill them.  At most, compassionate assisted suicide would be what you could describe the Earth equivalent how a healthy living body usually uses harm as a tactic.  And cancer is what you get when you DON'T take care of individuals, and they become broken.  So a healthy system doesn't get cancer.>Superorganisms and group species wod disagree.Can you give me an example of what you are thinking about here, as it comes to hierarchies?  Because I've never seen any evidence whatsoever of individual cells trying to control others and harming them by refusing to let them have the freedom or resources that they need to function well, in any species.>cells dont have that kind of complexityClearly you've never studied cellular behavior!  Cells are incredibly complex, and fascinating.  And since we animals are made up of an inordinate number of cells, we are even more complex and fascinating!  Which means that when we collaborate, instead of competing against ourselves, we can achieve astoundingly interesting stuff.  Such as moving a whole ecosystem from Earth to another planet...  Now **that's** some serious procreation!  Planet-sized procreation, in fact.  But first, we have to get our planet up and running as a global system.  Until then, we won't be able to create a fully formed baby planet (ecosystem).  So that's our goal with technology in the next decade or so.>Your brain controls muscles, hormonal responses, etc. Its gathers information but it also sends commands.Nope.  If you study the nervous system, you'll discover that all that flows through it is information, no ability to use force/control over other cells in the system.  The cells on the receiving end of the information are only getting data.  That's it.  When you get information about the weather from some media outlet (or even just your neighbor or family member) is that a ""command"" to you?  No, it's just information that you can use to decide what to do.  The same is what the nervous system is.  There is no control, just data.  The fact that most cells act on that data is a testament to the quality of that data.  Right now the data that we Earthlings get from our system-wide nervous system (the internet mostly, but television and radio as well) is, as I mentioned, crappy, because it's so patchy an incomplete.  Once our planetary nervous system is running well, and fully connected the way it is in an animal body, then individuals will be more likely to trust the information and act accordingly, making good decisions based on good data.#There is no proof, only data and analysis of data.  That's why dictionaries list many different definitions for most words.  And why every dictionary is different.  I'm just going by my experience when I said what I said.Ultimately, the words are mostly irrelevant, at least compared to what we actually do.#> The bulk of the resources necessary to survive are already owned by the bourgeoisie.That's the con that you've been led to believe.  It's absolutely not true.  Everything they ""own"" is what we've given to them.#Democracy IS competition.  As long as there is a contest (a vote) and the decisions made apply to all, even those who voted against it, then it's competition.Centralized control, even on a small scale, is the opposite of a healthy system.

If one bee tried to order another bee to do something it didn't want to do, that would be fucked up for everyone.  Also, how would that even work?I think what you're talking about is specialization, not hierarchy (or power).  Yes, there is a queen, but she's no more or less able to do what she wants than anyone else.  She doesn't control the other bees, and they don't control her.  And no bees are actively discriminated against when it comes to getting the resources they need to function well, unless the whole system is dangerously threatened (and thus not healthy).

Though I should say that textbooks are shitty places to learn anything, so you might want to avoid looking at them.

How are you imaging that happening?  What else is going out of the brain down the neurons in your body other than data?  Who are the cops of the brain?#I don't see classes.  They are a mental construct.  Not a reality.  You create them by believing in them and acting on that belief.  When you discriminate against someone for any reason, that's creating a divide that doesn't actually exist, since in reality we're all living beings trying to create and explore something meaningful so that our lives are worth living.  There is no ""proletariat and bourgeoisie"" in reality.  Just biological organisms, aiming to procreate in some way (physically, artistically, technologically, or culturally).Yes, there are people who are lacking in their basic needs.

Yes, of course.  Because telling yourself that you have a master means that you are the one forcing yourself to be a slave, not them.  If all humans who were taken by others refused to do what they were told, then there would be no slaves.  Sure, they might get harmed, or even killed.  But that would stop the whole tactic of trying to make people into slaves, since it would always fail.#[removed]#[removed]#[removed]#> How do these points attain value?The same way that any arbitrary symbol attains meaning/value, by us deciding it does.

You don't own the space that is outside of yourself.  That's public space.  Not yours.  Human rights end at the end of the human.  Literally.  You have a right to do what you want with your body, but you don't have a right to do anything to anyone else's body.  If you *actually* try to be in the *same space* as someone else, though, that's violating the laws of physics, and you're like to get hurt.  But being near someone, even touching them, is just normal life.  Your body is being touched by innumerable things right now, including other individual living things (mostly really small), and that's not anything you stop.  If you don't want to be touched by the rest of the universe, you're going to want to try to get out of the universe, because that's just how reality works.  Again, you can try to deny the physics/nature of reality, but it's not going to end well.If you don't like the things that are around you, you move.  That's your human right.  Anything beyond that is beyond your human right.#> Can you point towards any evolution that made a species less complex?Many cave species have lost their eyes due to evolution.

It has no choice. If it doesnt contract, or shows signs of abnormality, it is killed/ viewed as damaged. Theres no need to force it because it has no choice. It cant really disobey wihout being damaged.>What else is going out of the brain down the neurons in your body other than data?Hormones.#The computer that is winning at GO isn't AI.  It's just a good algorithm.  There is no intelligence there.  No ability to look at things from multiple perspectives and consider many different goals at once.  There is just one goal being looked at in that algorithm.  So it's not AI.  Just normal Artificial computation.And reality is silly.  (Have you seen quantum physics!?)  You can choose to accept that and go with it, or try to fight against it and get hurt. :P#I'm not a flight type.  I'm a freeze type.  I stand my ground.  If you want to try to push me over, you can try, but a history of pretty much professional trolls following me around for a full decade now verbally attacking all that is important to my life hasn't been able to stop me from sharing cool ideas and novel ways of viewing reality is good evidence that you're not going to get me to ""run away"" from sharing important and interesting information with the world.  See: /r/wholisticenchiladaSo if you are so scared of my words, then you are going to need to be the one to wander away from them.#My talent is in sharing a perspective of reality that very few have been lucky/unfortunate enough to see, which, to some, can be scary.No individual perspective is right, or wrong, but is simply one set of information that's been collected over a lifetime.  Each of our path's through life is different, so each of our stories will be different.What's your story?#> Why are $, £, ¥, BTC, Monopoly money, Reddit karma, etc., valuable? $ and £ have value because we require people to pay these currencies to engage in various economic activities where value is traded. If you trade two sheep for a 10 bushels of wheat, you will have to pay some amount of $ to the government, or else you will be imprisoned. That creates demand for $.Some cryptocurrencies have value because they have qualities that people look for in money, like scarcity. We have no evidence that a currency that is inflated indefinitely, to give an entire country's population a guaranteed periodic stipend, would be valued by people. You personally may like it, and demand it, but it takes the vast majority valuing the currency for it to hold any significant value.I think you need to think more critically about what you're promoting, and not be too hasty in assuming it would all work out.#> Nope. You don't own the space that is outside of yourself. That is the same as saying ""No. You don't own any space, including that which you call your body"".

Literally.No, not literally. A human right is defined as ""a right that is believed to belong justifiably to every person"". People have a right to the matter that they appropriate and add value to, including houses. They have a right to exclude people from their residence and enjoy their privacy. Your anti-human ideology is truly despicable.>If you actually try to be in the same space as someone else, though, that's violating the laws of physics, and you're like to get hurt. That's not violating the laws of physics. You can certainly make contact with them without violating any laws of physics.The way you cite physics to try to make your arguments sound semantically sound, when your arguments are total fallacies, is really off putting. It's just pretentious pseudo-intellectual garbage, with no integrity.#> Many cave species have lost their eyes due to evolution. We lost our tails.But we gained even more complexity.  Overall.  You never get a multicellular organism evolving to be a single celled organism.  At least I've never heard of such a thing.>Except the U.S./Canada are some of the best places to live. On the planet.And?  It's still fucked up.  Just because there are people who are murdered after being raped doesn't mean rape is hunky dory.I mean, many people are comfortable sitting in shit, and don't have the energy to get out.  But at least some of us know that we can do better, and continue to move life forward.>If the brain sends a signal to a muscle cell, the muscle cell contracts. It has no choice.It does have a choice.  All the cells are free to do what they want.  And they aren't treated as damaged if they are doing something that helps the body.  But, because the quality of the information in a healthy system is high (compared to our sick, broken system), most of the time the cells do use the data the brain offers to make decisions.  It's the same as it would be if your neighbor yelled into your window to tell you that your house was on fire, you'd probably act on that info asap.  You don't have to though.  Just like cells don't have to act on the info from the brain.  And that is often a good thing.  Having the ability to be free to do what seems right, given the information you have locally, compared to some distant information that might not be aware of the current situation.  If cells didn't have the freedom to prioritize local info over the brain's info, then we'd be far more likely to get hurt.  So it's evolutionarily valuable for the cells to be independent decision-makers, rather than ruled by authoritarian governance. Ultimately, though, there is no real choice in anything we do, regardless of whether we are a single cell or a lot of cells working together.  We're all just following the laws of physics as it shuffles matter and energy around in new and more interesting patterns, as the universe expands in time.  The only truly centralized/authoritarian control is the laws of physics.  Outside of that, everything is just a part of the pattern.  We're never free in that sense, of course.  But since reality is very likely random (in a mathematically pure way, which is the opposite of arbitrary, and is totally calculable and with a fully mappable pattern IF you have all the information from the starting point to the current point in time), then we are also always totally free to be ourselves and to do what we do, since that's what we always are...> Hormones  Hormones are released by individual cells all over the body, and can be taken up *or not taken up* by other cells, depending on whether or not the cells want to (as in, whether or not they choose to make those receptors and whether or not those receptors are open at the time).  Cells are free to take in and use those hormones however they want.I realize that this isn't the way you want to think of biology, and that's understandable.  We've been taught for most of our lives that centralized control is the only way to go, and so our view has become confused and muddy, so that it's not always easy to see how things are really working.#[removed]#[removed]#[removed]#> $ and £ have value because we require people to pay these currencies to engage in various economic activities where value is traded. If you trade two sheep for a 10 bushels of wheat, you will have to pay some amount of $ to the government, or else you will be imprisoned.Nope.  At least not in the US.  There is no way for someone to force me to pay $ if I don't have it.  They can ask, and they can even try to take away some of my privileges (driver's license, for one), but they can't force me to give anyone $ if I don't have it.  So, as long as I don't value $, I don't have to use it, and I can give and receive freely, or trade (not freely).  Which is how I've lived for nearly a decade with almost no $.As soon as a tipping point of other people decide that the $, or £, or ¥, or BTC, or Monopoly money, any other game scoring point system is valueless for a given situation (like living a healthy life) then it will BE valueless, for the majority of humans.>I think you need to think more critically about what you're promoting, and not be too hasty in assuming it would all work out.I think what you are confusing for haste is my brief comments about this, combined with a lack of curiosity on your part for asking for more explanation about what I mean.  I'm sorry for my part of that failure here...I've spent over a decade studying physics, psychology, biology, math, systems theory, consciousness, and growth, so, yeah, the critical thinking is very much covered.  But no one ever said anything about ""assuming it would all work out"".  That's just moronic.  Why would you even say that sort of thing?  There isn't a single human on the planet that would believe that everything will all just work out in the future, because that's not how brains work.  And making assumptions isn't really what they brain does either, when it comes to the important stuff, because that's the stuff that the brain puts a lot of effort into analyzing.  Assumptions are more like ""I'm going to assume that someone named Mark is a guy.""What I do see is the pattern of entropy/evolution as it moves us through time is one of expansion of diversity and collaboration, on the whole.  Yes, in any system there are outliers, and a chance that things will end up on ""the wrong edge of the bell curve"" so to speak, but over all, on average, things always move towards more complexity and randomness (in the mathematically pure sense, NOT ""arbitrariness""), so we get more and more creative, interesting, fun stuff in life as time goes on.  Which is exactly what we've seen since the big bang.  More and more complexity and simple stuff breaking apart and recombining to become more awesome stuff.  You can see this pattern in Pascal's triangle, with the combinations of stuff in the middle (most likely) outcome being more and more complex.  We start the universe (or really multiverse) off with just two things, nothingness and everythingness (or 0 and 1, or pure matter and pure energy or pure contraction and pure expansion, and so on).  And then we can see reality adding more detail and complexity to ""the stuff that exists right now"" as entropy breaks stuff apart and recombines it into new, weirder stuff.  So 0 and 1 become 00, 01, 10, and 11.  Which we can say represent pure matter, part matter and part energy, part energy and part matter (order is important in time-based stuff), and pure energy.  And then at the next moment in time we get 000, 001, 010, 100, 011, 101, 110, and 111.  Which represent even more complex combinations of matter and energy.  And so on.What does this all have to do with money?  Everything.  Since everything in the universe is governed by these laws of entropy, of dividing up simple things and recombining them into novel things, and that means that simple, centralized systems such as governments/societies, get taken apart and recombined into more interesting (diverse/decentralized) and more collaborative things.  We can see this modeled in biology where single celled (simple) organisms used to be the only option, and they were forced to compete against one another for resources.  But then, something happened, entropy/evolution started breaking those single celled organisms into multiple parts that could recombine with one another to form larger, more interesting, more complex, more collaborative organisms, like us animals.  This is how our local nations/cultures are starting to break up and recombine (via refuges, and immigrants, and even just memes/ideas on the internet) in novel ways, to form a whole global multicultural organism.  And when you have collaborative organization (game), rather than competition, keeping a competitive score ($, £, ¥, BTC, Monopoly money, etc.) is no longer at all useful, and thus becomes mostly valueless except as an antique for historical study.#I'm not making arguments.  I'm just sharing data, so that you might be able to see reality from a different perspective than your own, limited one.  I'm essentially letting you know what the weather is in my part of the world.  You can deny that it is sunny and cold, and even insult me and my offerings of information, because you are in a part of the world where it is not sunny and cold, but that seems like an act of ignorance on your part.  Or, if trolling, it's a lame way to try to get more information out of me, since it would be more enjoyable for me to share if I knew that you were honestly curious about what the weather is like in my part of the world.>A human right is defined as ""a right that is believed to belong justifiably to every person"".Yes, and the only logical, rational view I can see is that the only rights of humans are for them to be what they are and do to what they do, inside the boundaries of themselves.  Anything beyond a given human body is not a part of that human, and thus, quite logically, ""outside the human's rights"".  This is the opposite of arbitrary, as it's literally the defining boundary of what it means to be a human being.  Are my clothes a human being?  No.  They are on me, but not me.  Same with my glasses.  And everything else that's outside of my body.  If my body didn't make something, and it's not connected to the body, then it is NOT ME.  And thus not human, and thus has no rights as a human, and I have no rights in regards to it.  In the universal law, anyway.  We can make up artificial and arbitrary ""laws"" about all sorts of things, and say that, for example, it's a ""human right for all humans to have 10 clementines to eat every day"", but that has no basis in reality.  If I move into a house, which I have done, that does not mean that I have a right to stop others from entering that house.  They can do so whenever they choose, and I have no universal ability to stop them.  I can certainly try to kick them out, but that's not a guarantee, and to say that it is is irrational and going to get me hurt, because it's a lie.  If you want to lie to yourself, that's your prerogative (it's a human right, even, since it's all inside your body), but, again, it's going to get you hurt to go against reality.But maybe you see things differently, so I'll ask you how else could you possibly assign rights to a human, in meaningful and realistic way that holds up in the long term and is testable/verifiable?>If you actually try to be in the same space as someone else, though, that's violating the laws of physics, and you're like to get hurt. That absolutely does violate the laws of physics.  Except at absolute zero, when have you ever heard of two particles taking up the same space at the same time?  We're not talking particles that are near one another, as I already said, but in the exact same space.  I already went over the whole bit about the universe always touching you, and that being a guarantee.  It's a human right for you to be touched, all the time, by other things, sometimes other humans even.  And it's also your human right to choose to move away from anyone touching you (as long as there is somewhere for you to move to that is within reaching distance, of course - if you are in an elevator with 10 other humans, and the doors are closed, then no, you might not have the right to move away from them).#> But we gained even more complexity. Overall.Yes, but that doesnt mean that evolution doesnt reduce complexity. Its prioritises survival, n9t complexity.>It does have a choiceHow so? Even when the organism is dead, a muscle will still contract to an electrical signal. What scientific papers have you seen that say cells not responding to impulses is a good thing? We tend to call those things harmful. Name one paper.#Just because the best chef in the world is making something doesn't make it food...I'm sorry you're so bothered by my view of reality that you feel the need to be offensive and try to push them away.  That's gotta suck to be so scared of reality.#Like I said, my view of reality has come from a rather exceptional path through life, compared to the mainstream, average one.  So my descriptions of what I've seen might indeed be scary and weird to you.  That's normal.  Fight against it if you need to.  To protect yourself from seeing reality on it's more unexpected edges.#Why do you think you aren't free to be yourself?  What do you think makes you feel the need to hide your true self?  Are you not feeling as awesome as you want to be?  Because I bet that you are awesome, underneath that facade of yours.  All that crap that accumulated around you makes it hard to see inside, but I'm pretty sure that there is something brilliant in there, somewhere.#Complexity increases survival, since complexity is how you get diversity and collaboration in a system.  Simple systems are too rigid to adapt to variable environments.  Evolution thus moves life to be more complex (specifically in a collaborative and diverse way) over time, on average.  Divide things up then recombine them in new ways, to get something better, that's genetics for you.  Which, it turns out, is also entropy.And if you want to learn about cells and why it's necessary for them to be able to prioritize local information instead of distant information that might be out of date or missing crucial data, then go explore biology yourself.  Look at how cells choose to use the information and materials around them to do the work that they want to do, and see what you find.  I'm not going to do your homework for you, silly. :P  And if I tried, you'd just look for a way to protest whatever I shared with you, since you have your heart religiously set on your current beliefs.  If you are truly curious about what I'm saying, then you'll go look for evidence of it yourself.#[removed]#[removed]#> And if you want to learn about cells and why it's necessary for them to be able to prioritize local information instead of distant information that might be out of date or missing crucial data, then go explore biology yourself.

That's only useful in the limited, non-reality (human designed rules), of math.

You can't outsource your understanding.  At least not if you want to learn things effectively.

That's an unusual and unrealistic approach to science, in my experience.

Scala doesn't suddenly do ""big data"" a ton better. If you want to start with Spark  you can just use Python. Our data scientists write all their models in Python. I also don't see why you think you ""have"" to work on 50GB of data. You can work on smaller sets  otherwise on your local machine you'd be spending most time waiting for the process to finish. #I'm not sure there is really any specific ""big data"" things you learn. But I work with this stuff and in a previous life consulted for a load of different companies that are using big data and the general technologies I encounter and you'd need to know to do my job from the engineering/infrastructure perspective are...Relational Databases - The basics, even with all the fancy bells and whistles most companies are still pushing all the data into a relational database (likely for convenience/legacies sake). PostGres is my personal favourite as it's what I use but if you're just using a relational database as an end point then they're all pretty much the same if you know how to use SQL.Google Big Query - On input pretty similar to normal relational stuff but works on a slightly different concept behind the scenes where it breaks down into granularity on a very large scale. Also v useful as you can piggyback off of Google Analytics and bounce data from there and aggregate it. Read up on how it works at a deeper level (google documents stuff pretty well and there's plenty of books on it)Elastic Search - This is a real big data technology imo if you're familiar with Java then this should be pretty easy and it's pretty simple to download and set-up and work with. Learn what an ELK stack is Of note as I'm talking about elastic search understanding and working with JSON data is pretty essential as a concept you mention you know some Java so that's probs not too crazy. Hadoop: I run into this a lot, e.g King Games (candy crush) use it pretty heavily to store all the data generated by their games every day that they use to do the analysis with which they change their games. Personally I'm not particularly wedded to it but it's definitely a useful thing to know about as it is one of the technologies that you can store huge amounts of shit with and it's one of the technologies that are definitely ""big data"" in terms of the concepts being used. It is also pretty specialist and obscure to learn. Learn the concepts of parallel processing. Imo there is nothing magical about ""big data"" this is the central concept of ""scaling out not up"". That makes big data possible. Another concept as well that's interesting is if you read up on how node based data works. Apache thrift afaik isn't what facebook actually uses but that's described in Marz's book and is good to get an idea of the concept. In terms of books there's a very good book I own by Nathan Marz called ""Big Data: principles and best practices of scalable real time data systems"". It's good as it gives the concepts of various systems without being particularly wedded to specific codes. As said in terms of doing it at home, if you know how to configure a  proper DwH on a small scale using big data principles if you've done it right then it'll scale out to ridiculous levels anyway without too much work (in theory lol).If you want to build something at home you can take session data from analytics, Export it to big query, pull that data using a job of whatever sort (e.g python) analyse it using something like Elasticsearch or Spark then push the results to a relational database then that'd give you a pretty good overview on what most companies are doing in different ways, also worth noting but a lot of the non-relational systems like hadoop came about because relational wasn't able to keep up a couple of years ago but there's companies like Exasol and Oracle who do relational databases that run in parallel systems that are arguably just as good now and Postgres and open source people are catching up pretty rapidly as Postgres can be run in parallel now since 9.6 or so. #I've started writing my answer again for at least 10 times. I tried to fit in general notes about what is expected from full stack developers working in typical applications that handle huge amounts of real time data. But the topic is really way too wide.The tricky thing in big data is rarely about the code itself. If you understand computing parallelization and are familiar with your chosen databases, you can usually get away with the basic data-pushing and analyzing part quite easily. Managing the communication and all that between all the parts of the application is often the hardest part.It gets trickier when you have to scale horizontally. Infrastructure management and database scaling are usually the hardest topics in making high-availability, realtime, high-throughput applications. But again, there's not any specific magic bullets in here, it's just about being generally familiar and comfortable with your chosen tools.If you want to be a full stack developer who can work with big data, you need to know about infrastructure (Linux, the tools available on Amazon and Google, virtualization techniques, etc), databases (SQL is a must, some NoSQL databases are worth it, caching techniques like using Redis are important), scaling databases and parallelizing computation (and the associated tools like Hadoop) in addition to the typical frontend and backend tools and languages. You can learn enough of all of this to be a good generalist, but it's not something that would fit into one or two books. Many people also specialize in a single topic here.Can you be more specific about what you exactly would like to learn to do well?#You wont learn what the hell is going on with Spark if you use Scala either. Spark has HUGE abstraction, and you wont understand it unless you start understanding what's going on behind the scenes and know how distributed computing is done. #I'm not a big data guy but I think most don't solve big data problems with just one machine...it would probably take forever depending on the amount of data. Have you looked into distributed computing? I bought a rack of 5 raspberry pies, and I got practice via writing a script for one of the raspberry pies to assign work to the other 4 raspberry pies.  I did a calculation of pi via the Monte Carlo method and distributed the work amongst the 4 pis to increase speed since the problem could be solved in parallel. #The books Designing Data Intensive Applications and Big Data (the Twitter one about the lambda architecture) are both great. They give very sound reasoning on how and why things are doneScala, Spark, and Kafka are all hot right now too so reading up on them and making a demo project would do you wonders#So the thing with spark is, its a massive platform that relies on top of different other platforms (for example, hadoop, zookeeper, yarn, or mesos, each one with its own levers  that you can setup and that sometimes arent really documented) that can be used for multiple things. Additionally, it has 3 different apis as their core (java/scala/python, not  including SparkR) with their apis varying with every version, and also varying between language implementations.  To make things best, support is spotty, with databricks forums being a dead end, the mail list being not really curated (you would be amazed at how many messages just include an error trace with no context) and the only way to ask things to real spark devs being to submitt a jira ticket.I know there are TONS of articles of people showing you how to do a wordcount in spark. That is not really spark.If you really want to get into spark, I would recommend getting the [spark certification](http://www.oreilly.com/data/sparkcert)?I really liked [this](https://www.gitbook.com/book/jaceklaskowski/mastering-apache-spark/details) , i read the previous version, I think this version has updated api changes.Source: Deployed and use spark clusters multiple times. Fighting with my cluster as we speak.#> My work right now does not deal with big data, but I figure it's a must-know for the general industry.I wouldn't say it is a must.#Maybe learning Data Science would be a good start or what you want: https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go/blob/master/README.md . Basically it sounds like you want to analyze big data. #> Anyone know of a brief book or perhaps a series of posts on a blog that can get me from noob-status to being confident with 50GB of data for ETL?You can't just learn Hadoop or Spark?  Have you heard of OReilly?#[deleted]#Mm, most things called ""big data"" are not actually particularly problematic to handle for ordinary senior developers.Where I work at we collect real time audio data and event data and such from multiple clients and this data gets into tens of gigabytes for even a single client. We must also present it in real time or close-to realtime and you have to be able to search for time ranges and tags in it and stuff. It's analyzed to find behavioural reactions and stuff like that.Want to know what tools we use?Standard AWS for servers, standard PostreSQL for storage, standard Node for web backend, standard Python (with Numpy) for analysis, standard JavaScript with a graph component at the frontend. There's nothing magical in the code nor in the database design.This is seen and called as big data by some of the clients and marketers, but it's not really particularly tricky to handle for me. Some big data is quite straightforward, especially if you don't need to scale strongly horizontally or if you can scale easily by splitting datasets according to client or stuff like that.When you do need to start horizontally scaling both effectively and automatically, it becomes a little more problematic, but the tricky part is the infrastructure management rather than the actual code (tho of course the code too needs to accommodiate, but it's usually quite easy with well-chosen tools and libraries). In this case, being familiar with cloud infrastructures, virtualization techniques and parallel computing is helpful. Looking into some NoSQL databases might be useful for some cases, though there's often a bit of extra hype around those that doesn't really always match the reality.Nowadays the world is really full of scalable data storage and computation systems. Being familiar with what Amazon and Google offer for tools used for scaling is important.#Or you could use Java, considering both Hadoop and Spark are written in it#I also found the Google Big Table, Amazon Dynamo, and Apache Cassandra papers really enlightening#I feel like this is a good case of doing is better than reading. What I might try to do force myself to solve problems that require a distributed solution, and than set up that environment. In other words, try to simulate an enterprise problem. It'd be tough, but I don't know of any way to gain access to that kind of scale without working in it.#This was always what I found funny consulting with companies doing ""big data"". You'll always get some talk of Hadoop, scala, Mongo db **insert NoSql fashionable sounding system here** etc without people knowing that these are all specific solutions to very specific problems. Half the issues where it hinges on ""we have too much data to actually look at it at the level of granularity we want"" can be solved with parallelisation or sharding a database (not exactly best practice but workable) while still in a relational context. Or whack it all into AWS/BigQuery and let them handle the fiddly bits and spending days rewriting C to get a 0.0001 second improvement in speed. I'd still say to OP as I do in my own response to be aware of NoSQL and the possibilities of it but there is no ""Big Data"" system to learn in the same way as SQL is essential to know as someone working with ""not-big"" Data. #[deleted]#Ooo tens of gigabytes...That's nothing. How about 100 TB for a single project. That's the sort of data that I work with. #How would one go about doing this?#Definitely, those then are the actually tricky and interesting cases! And I wish this was the real use for the term ""big data"" in the marketing jargon as well.I've recently myself wanted also to get closer to managing both extremely large and extremely robust infrastructures (was hoping to, in a few years, move mainly to project manager type stuff with various more challenging infra projects. A little bored of the years of usual codin' work). I've played around with Hadoop and more self-tailored scalable systems, but never really could put them under a real test of insane data flows - in the end, most projects that the marketing guys or such have been describing around as big data, have fell way below any actual infrastructural challenge. Would you mind describing the pipeline you ended up with?#[deleted]#The total for the whole product is in them terabytes.The point wasn't that though, it was that many ""big data"" projects are not nearly as ambitious tech wise than is made to seem and often don't necessarily require any kind of arcane knowledge.Meaning - if you want to get into projects or jobs dealing with ""big data"", you can get pretty far (or all the way) with just a solid grasp of the standard tools for any project and with some basic idea about how horizontal scaling might be done if needed. The ""tens of gigabytes"" was a straight reference to the opening post. It's indeed a trivial amount of data, but with a bit of data partioning it's a chunk that you often can get down to.#[deleted]#That's really cool, I actually hadn't spent too much thought on that these systems have to of course be easily (in relative terms) pluggable into and expendable by other people in the company who might not work in the same unit with you and who might have wildly different needs and expectations for their data.Thanks for the description!

I'm quite convinced it's the self-driving cars that have people mistakenly confused about AI being such a big deal. What people lose sight of is that cars are highly artificial and largely automated from day one. A self-driving car is not intelligent, it is simply responding to input in an artificial man-made environment with clear and specific rules in a quite mechanical way. It's not intelligence, it's simply better sensors which allow basic boolean logic to follow pre-established rules. Yeah sure there are programs that can teach themselves how to perform succesfully according to pre-existing rules through repetitive iterations. Neural networks are indeed based on biological systems but the hype over what they can achieve has been running at the high water mark for some time now. Such algorithms are far from a general intelligence of an insect such as a mosquito. Mosquitoes are amazingly intelligent compared to billion dollar neural networks.  There isn't a general trend towards believing false messages today that is any stronger than it was in the past. If you go back to the 80s, the use of focus groups to divide the voters into blocks that could be targeted with specific language to elicit the correct responses was being done back when desktop calculators were more common than PCs. The basic fact is not that Trump has significant support at all or that there is a global tilt to the right. Hardly, it's quite the opposite. Notice California just legalized marijuana as well as the first state on the East Coast. Seems to have been forgotten in the hysteria over Trump. Rather, the basic fact is that left leaning voters who were registered as Democrats voted for and expected Bernie Sanders to be the Democratic nominee and when they felt robbed by the party insiders they walked away and said --fuck it, this game is rigged. Trying to spin that into Trump is taking over the world with the help of his pocket calculator is a false narrative. #Seems like the tone of the article is that This is a billionare who *funds the party that isn't mine*, which is bad.  If he were funding my party, this wouldn't be a story. I mean, really: >This is a billionaire who is, as billionaires are wont, trying to reshape the world according to his personal beliefs.Is there anyone who *doesn't* try to 'reshape the world according to his personal beliefs'?   It would be one thing if all billionaries had the same political opinion, but in reality they seem to be spread according to the same distribution as everyone else. #I didn't get that at all from the article, and if that's the most damning quote you found I'd say you're overreacting.#[deleted]#>Haven't you wondered why your relatives on Facebook are all following the same conspiracy theories?That hits a bit close to home - they seem to think soros is somehow funding violent groups infiltrating otherwise peaceful protests. #I see that Liberals as usual are casting about for any possible explanation for why they're out of power - except looking at their own behavior.  Some random billionaire on the other side is a conspiracy! and evil! and totalitarian!  George Soros funding my own side?  That's enlightened political behavior.   Ask yourself this: if people really were that able to be manipulated by billionaires, then why haven't all the ones on the Democratic side - and think about tech guys, hollywood activists, Soros and most of Wall Street for that matter, done so already? #[deleted]#If your theory is true, why is it that the GOP uses technology and the Democrats don't?   Did the Republicans, what, find a magic crystal shard that there's only one of?  Are Republicans just inherently smarter than Democrats, who can't figure out how to nail two boards together?   Can Democrats not spell 'Algorithm'? #Yeah, I'm not really seeing many people investigate both. It's either Soros or Mercer, never both or any of the hundreds of others.#""An evil conspiracy is why I lost"" is much easier to accept than ""The voters just didn't like my policies"""
WikiLeaks;5v9tud;1487654987.0;/r/WikiLeaks/comments/5v9tud/as_david_brock_plots_to_impeach_president_trump/;As David Brock plots to impeach President Trump, Andrew Kerr documents the means to bring down Media Matters through Tax Evasion and Illegal Federal Election Campaign Contributions;###Confidential David Brock Memo: Defeat Trump Through ImpeachmentPrivate memo lays out plan for next four yearshttp://freebeacon.com/uncategorized/confidential-david-brock-memo-defeat-trump-impeachment/>According to the private and confidential memo, Brock plans to defeat Trump “through impeachment,” using American Bridge, his liberal super PAC, as the main vehicle to do so.https://www.scribd.com/mobile/document/337235212/Confidential-David-Brock-American-Bridge-Memo (3 Pages)>“No other progressive organization has the resources and assets that American Bridge has amassed over the past several election cycles to hold Trump, his administration, and the politicians accountable,” the 44-page confidential memo states.While President Trump could defend himself from the media attacks I would suggest a different tactic. I would suggest President Trump goes on the offensive and prosecute Brock for the many financial crimes that appear in his publicly recorded tax filings and corporate financial disclosures. All the information is sourced and we'll documented in Kerr's stores of articles at www.thecitizensaudit.com add well as other sources available on the Internet.  Andrew Kerr is an Investigative Reporter with a background in Information Technology working with Big Data that has uncovered evidence that David Brock is guilty of embezzling from his own 501C3 through fraudulent payments to his own organizations. Additionally he alleges that Brock violated Federal campaign Finance LawsKerr alleges, with documents available through public record research, Brock then charging fees to the organization to do what are essentially paper work transfers between organizations he owns/manages, essentially embezzling the funds and had not declared the income on his tax returns. ###The 14 Pro-Clinton Organizations that Share Office Spacehttp://www.thecitizensaudit.com/2016/09/12/pro-clinton-organizations-share-office-space/>Last week, The Citizens Audit exposed how the Clinton Campaign Illegally Purchased “Research” from pro-Democrat Super PAC, and how Media Matters for America is Filing Fraudulent Tax Returns by hiding rental income.>This week, we plan to expose even more.  However, before we do so, it’s important for us to properly set the stage.>During our investigation, we identified 14 organizations that share the following address:>455 Massachusetts Avenue NW, 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20001###David Brock’s Super PAC Has Made Over $1 Million in Rent Payments to a Company That Might Not Existhttp://www.thecitizensaudit.com/2016/12/15/david-brock-super-pac-making-rent-payments-to-company-that-doesnt-exist/###What’s the total damage?>From 2010 to 2016, American Bridge 21st Century has sent $1,019,917 in potentially fraudulent rent payments to Square 516 Office Venture, a company that doesn’t own the building, nor exist as a business in Washington DC.###Andrew Kerr - Investigative Findings on The Hagmann Reporthttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf0hUeIVp7Y###The Citizen's Audit's Andrew Kerr exposes MASSIVE FRAUD by David Brock and the Clinton machinehttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8210jIuaXYk###David Brock’s Media Matters Has Hidden $1,052,500 From The IRS Since 2010https://www.hagmannreport.com/from-the-wires/david-brocks-media-matters-has-hidden-1052500-from-the-irs-since-2010/>David Brock, recently described by Politico as “the Democrats’ dark-arts master,” has some explaining to do.>His organization, Media Matters for America, has failed to report to the IRS over $1 million in sublet rental income from 2010 to 2014.It is well known that Brock contributed large amounts of time and support to the Clinton campaign, but according to Kerr, Brock crossed the line and violated campaign financing laws supporting the Clinton campaign. The public documents and Income Tax Filings support his position. Several irregularities also exist within publicly recorded Filing documents required for the operation of his 14 501C3 PACs that indicate Brock illegally collided with the Clinton campaign and provided deficiency support well beyond the legal limits. Once a PAC works in collusion with a campaign they are restricted in the amount they can contribute to a candidate and it is a Federal Crime to violate these limits. ###17 Counts of Illegal Coordination Exposed: Pro-Clinton Super PAC Implicatedhttp://www.thecitizensaudit.com/2016/10/24/17-counts-of-illegal-coordination-exposed-pro-clinton-super-pac-implicated/###Super PAC Coordination: An Explainer Part 2http://www.thecitizensaudit.com/2016/10/19/super-pac-coordination-an-explainer-part-2/r/CoincidenceTheorist-23-;"anti-corruption does not = pro-trump. fuck david brock!#And now we know why CTR no longer exists as this entity. They re laundered the money.#Andrew Kerr peddles fake news.  >From 2010 to 2016, American Bridge 21st Century has sent $1,019,917 in potentially fraudulent rent payments to Square 516 Office Venture, a company that doesn’t own the building, nor exist as a business in Washington DC.Yes, because the company that owns the building is called ""Square 516**S** Office Venture LLC"" which is a subsidiary of Vornado Realty Trust, a major commercial real estate company.And they are sending the rent checks to 2101 L Street NW STE 700, which is occupied by Cushman & Wakefield, the law firm that works as a broker for Vornado Realty Trust.Somehow this is evidence that David Brock is stealing all the rent money from the landlord, I guess?  Kerr doesnt really say, he just tells us that this ""doesnt look good"".His other articles are much of the same.  Someone who doesnt understand what he is doing is painstakingly sifting through public records, finding typos, and then trying to spin them into conspiracy theories.I explained this error and some of his other errors to him months ago, but he told me that 10,000 people are signed up to his newsletter so apparently he is just interested in peddling fake news in exchange for clicks.#So if I take the effort to prove you wrong will you pin a public apology at the top of DNC leaks for a week and remove my ban. Make it worth my while to put together a document tonight with links and documentation to prove my point. #[removed]#> Are you following me around. You booted me from DNCleaks when your rude little snowflakes got offended.I booted you for posting conspiracy bullshit like this and other garbage.>It's not my fault the punks whining at DNCleaks couldn't defend their arguments with anything more articulate than Duck You. I just explained very articulately why this claim from Andrew Kerr is bogus, but you ignored that.>You've told me this, but your supposed typo was made over multiple years on multiple forms.Of course it was.  You think someone is typing up documents by hand?  Whoever entered the company name in the accounting system left out the letter S.  That's all that happened here.  Every time they printed a check, their computer printed the name entered in the system.>Either prove your point from documents or go pound sand. I did prove my point.  How do you think Brock is stealing this money from a typo?  Kerr's nutty story doesnt even make any sense.  He hasnt proven anything but he posts this crap because its the only way he can get clicks, to fool people into thinking he found some conspiracy that nobody knows about!>I read the same silly news sources you did and they are wrong. LOL.  What silly news sources are you talking about here? I'm referencing the information at the site you posted!>There is a pattern of documentation that shows you wrong, and they are available from public records sites.What pattern?  How am I wrong?  Explain how a typo in the database for the company's name that leaves off one letter, and the fact that the checks are sent to the office of the real estate broker who manages this property show that Brock stole a million bucks here, because I'm just not seeing it.#Are you taking my challenge our not.

Propogandising a population really fucks with the whole principle of democracy, to my eye. If you have the money to use it, it gives disproportionate power, and that is something deeply sinister.#The media as a whole has replaced news with political commentary, this isn't a new phenomenon but it's reached new lows during these last few years. Couple this with the rise of independent media, bloggers and falling revenue, it's now completely in the gutter - these accusations of a 'Neo-Lugenpresse' don't come from nowhere.Now the media doubles down, looks for demons who it can blame for it's misfortune. They did this to themselves. Some billionaire spending money on an analytics company to consult on an election campaign isn't news, it's something every side does in every major campaign - trying to make a story out of an analytics platform being used to help win an election is like trying to make a story out of water being wet.I work in Data Science, the kind of things we can do these days amazes and scares me, there is a story in that - but building the article around 'Look at this sinister figure who stole our democracy' is everything wrong with the media on all sides.#I was originally introduced to the Filter Bubble by the sidebar here, and I'd recommend the book. Much of it touches similar ground to this.#They always do profiles on the right wing donors but never on big unions donating to the left?

Where is the Guardian hit piece on him and the organisations he funded like [Correct the Record](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-clinton-digital-trolling-20160506-snap-htmlstory.html) which went around paying people to post fake articles on social media espousing their support of Hillary.#Combine that with calls for referendums and direct democracy and you have a perfect shitstorm. #That's what the mainstream media is, that's what all media is. The era of simply reporting on the facts is over or maybe it never even existed, this is the era of political bias.#Why shouldn't unions donate and influence politics? They openly have a political purpose, stated aims and so on. It is akin to any political action group. This isn't just a question of donor groups, this is a question of allowing extremely refined social manipulation by a particular faction in an age of social media. #> They always do profiles on the right wing donors but never on big unions donating to the left?I think thats a pretty ridiculous comparison to make given the nature of unions compared with that of private individuals with lots of disposable income.#[deleted]#[deleted]#[deleted]#Yep. One of the little-voiced defenses of representative democracy is that it can provide accountable representatives with agglomerated power to balance against those who want to buy power.

That has nothing to do with the voting mechanism behind them: there is no requirement that Parliaments avoid such mistakes either.As for the rest, well, you personally disagreeing doesn't mean the process doesn't work unless you define the perfect democracy as a dictatorship of you.#Maybe if you are going to allow people to shot from your roof and sell their data and charge a fee to people hoping to market to roofers you could be open and consistent with your policyThe government very much does already#Yes and a public institution owes nothing to a private news company.#Yes and a public institution owes nothing to a private news company.#Surely even the slightest whiff should be investigated thoroughly?#I have yet to see the case where someone prevented from using a social media platform didn't actually break their rules.

Facebook, twitter and Instagram have all had well publicised grief for banning for things like breast feeding#Considering we have the resignation and ongoing investigations both here and across the pond that can't possibly be true.#That seems an overzealous application of their rules, probably due to automation, not breaking their own rules.Are you unhappy with how the free market in social media platforms is functioning? Perhaps there are concerns around monopolisation? Well, that sound like you've got little faith in the market indeed!#I think you are confusing me with some one else. I'm.not some free market zealot#Well, it's normally a rightwing thing to worship at the altar of the almighty market, and i'm just amused that the current rightwing whinge is that the market is a cruel god which has failed them.I'm also unconvinced by the claims of bias. Plenty of people seem to avoid breaking the rules on social media, and those skirting the boundaries are likely to eventually trip up.#Why are you talking about free markets and the right wing? Are you on meds?#OK, so, social media companies are private entities, and their behaviour cannot be considered censorship as a result. Their success or failure is a result of market behaviour.The right wing is bitching about some of their weirder members getting kicked off some social media, false news stories being screened out etc. Any such behaviour which acts against them results from success in a free marketplace, and thus I find it funny, because effectively you've got some of the most extremely rightwing people arguing against private enterprises being able to run by their own rules within the law.If you're whining about social media platforms from a non-right-wing position, that's fine, but it doesn't particularly amuse me.#Censorship is the suppression of free speech, public communication or other information which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect or inconvenient as determined by governments, media outlets, authorities or other groups or institutions.[1]Governments, private organizations and individuals may engage in censorship. When an individual such as an author or other creator engages in censorship of their own works or speech, it is referred to as self-censorshipYou seem to work on a binary scale. Not all right wing people are free marketers, there are paleo con s and neo cons"
datascience;5x53qi;1488480667.0;/r/datascience/comments/5x53qi/how_common_is_python_compared_to_r_in_data/;How common is Python compared to R in Data Science in the corporate world?;My experience with data science is strictly from an acedemic standpoint. To that end there is a lot of SAS Stata and some R sprinkled in (my undergraduate course was taught in R, but it seems rare in the actual post-graduate community).In terms of corporate/private sector/Big Data/etc world though, how common are Python and R? What languages are the big players? I cant see a firm like Google or IBM using SAS or Stata;"Python and Java.In commercial environments, you will be doing more software and the needs to connect to other systems, ingest and fix data, often in streams and not loaded into memory.  Those tasks are more common than in academia. Python is better at this than R. SAS (and of course Excel) is very common in old-school financial industries (banks/insurance), and very rare in silicon-valley type technology environments.  IBM owns SPSS.  In technology there is some use of R, but python is preferred. Stata is a near zero.  Government labs and engineering can have MATLAB. #You build the models in R, productionize in Python. Of course, this is not always true, but it is one relatively common approach. That is to say, each language has its own strengths and its weaknesses, and as tools they are not mutually exclusive. Depending on the task and the stage of the work, and obviously the company, the languages used may differ and intertwine.#Python is more general purpose and thus better suited to be integrated in a larger project, however R has a larger community of people implementing every single new algorithm or model that makes it to a peer-reviewed journal. At my company we use both R and Python depending on the project. However for real-time systems or complex production data pipelines we use other languages and frameworks (e.g. Scala + Spark).#In the company I work for we normally use Python for production. I typically explore / prototype using R, then move to R for production  other coworkers go with Python directly, but I like my way so I don't lose touch with R.Also, heavy amounts of Java (like for coding HIVE's UDFs/UDAFs.)#It depends a lot on what your role is. Data science is unfortunately not something that defines easily as one predefined skill set, familiarities with one set of tech stacks, or use of one set of languages or another. Data science is a catch-all meant to describe something I think will further specialize over time. It's happening right now with ""data engineering"" vs ""data science"".Data scientists are scientists but with the ability to use modern computational hardware, and sensor data. That's it. Their background can be as diverse the catch-all ""Scientist"". There are psychologists, physicists, chemists, biologists, and hundreds more. It's the same in data science.Some data scientists are responsible for making production software as well as the analysis / model building part, so they'd likely use Python at times for both. That's me (sort of) however we have a lot of production work all over the place in terms of languages or stacks so I just use what connects easily with everything for my analyses even if I have to code in PHP at times.Some data scientists are more likely spending their time building models and exploring data before handing it off to an engineering team and working more as a product manager for their piece at that point (I wish that was me). Those people might use R because frankly it's easier than Python for scientific research in many ways. It just has so much more stuff available and a long history for being used in research and charting, etc.Then it also depends on the data scientist's background, company size, company production stacks (i.e. for web or analytics or whatever the team they're on does).So long story short, it's really hard to say. For a gross simplification I'd go with : 1) Python is used by traditional engineering groups2) R is used by traditionally scientific groupsCompanies are, after all, a collection of people so their backgrounds will collectively influence what they use, at least early on. It's slower moving for bigger companies and it's more likely a new hire has to adapt to what they are using (so based on history) rather than the other way around.Then of course what a data scientist personally uses for their own research is totally up to them. If it's just digging in to a problem and you don't have to share it with a larger organization then it doesn't really matter what you use. Whatever works works.#Far from an expert here, but we use R.  We looked into Python, but it seems R is steadily becoming more and more prevalent....existing programs (especially microsoft programs) are beginning to incorporate the ability to use or connect with R.  #I'm going to disagree with most people here and say that it really doesn't matter. I am yet to come across any good companies who say anything other than, ""We don't really care what you use, we just want you to do your job"". I know data scientists who use excel as well. Mainly because you can churn out 10 graphs in excel for a presentation in 5 seconds versus having to remember how to use ggplot or seaborn. Just my .02#I routinely use both.#Since Python and R are free most companies use those.  Of course Excel is still widely used. SAS is mostly in banking and pharmaceuticals areas.#Data scientists at Google primarily use R. For production models, the actual R code will be called by a C++ or Java pipeline, but those pipelines tend to be written by software engineers rather than data scientists.For ad hoc analysis, though, plenty of Googlers use iPython-like notebooks.#Python for scripting. R for models. #We mostly use Python and Java. JavaScript for web stuff (viz mostly). #Have you used Shiny apps for R? The BI guys at my office use it and it allows anyone with a web browser to create dashboards. Super dope #Word.  I'm at my second organization where I've put R models into production - I'm now starting to run into an issue now and then.It's worth noting that the very popular XGBoost will fuck up your predictions without warning if you build in version 4-4 and predict in the latest 6-x under certain conditions (probably training with constant columns as features).  Took me a week to figure out what the hell was wrong.#> I typically explore / prototype using R, then move to R for production wat#Can someone explain what packages Python has that allows it to be used in production more easily or handle large datasets more easily?#New excel versions will indeed support r woop.#Yeah SQL Server 2016 should connect directly to R now but haven't checked it out yet or what it can do better than the corresponding R packages#This only works if everyone's projects are one-offs that don't have to integrate with a larger system. #Matplotlib is the worst. Terrible syntax. #I'm always suprsied Excel is used so much considering how large the risk is for problems due to all it's magic. For instance last year it was revealed that some genome studies were invalid because Excel had auto changed genetic data into dates.#I've been told differently by a former Google, now Google Venture employee yesterday.Perhaps it depends what team you're on?#Ive heard a lot about shiny. Are the dashboards realtime?#Hey can you recommend what i should to make dashboards in python? I am not much familiar with R#Are you using packrat or checkpoint? I have put R models into production as well. Since we were using checkpoint+docker, I never had problems due to different package versions.#D-oh! R for prototyping, Python for production.#Pandas is well known.  Look into Anaconda, and the packages that come with it.#I like to see more answers for this question as well. As far as I understand, more people have experience of putting python models into production, and that momentum is basically taking this idea forward. (I have deployed R models into production) #I'm sure there's something I'm missing, but I can't see why you would ever want to do that? R can already read and write xlsx and csv files, so what else do you need? Manipulating R stuff in Excel beyond that seems like a recipe for a headache.#It also works if the organization separates its science and engineering capabilities. Which, ime, is the case. #what's the alternative?#Yep. While I use Python for 95% of my day-to-day work, whenever I need to plot, I export my data to R for ggplot. Hadley is a god.#Excel is a solid tool.  It is up to the stakeholders to be aware of the shortcomings of it.#Link to the report ?#> Perhaps it depends what team you're on?It definitely does. I should have said ""Data scientists on the team I worked on at Google...."" Google has enough employees that there's a wide spectrum in the tools that get used.#I would assume so. Not at Google but moving around in my company I've gone from the tricked out Matlab license, to SAS, to Python (Spyder). #Depends. Is your data real time?#So the way our guy has it set up, it's as close to real-time as you can get. We do vehicle repossessions and the data comes from our inventory management software. So when you open up the app, it downloads a fresh csv file to create the graphs #I've looked into this a lot. The short answer is, there is not currently any single package with the same functionality as R's shiny.  For dashboarding, I'd look into the Airbnb tool [Superset](https://github.com/airbnb/superset) (which has had like 100 previous names/brandings...).  I played around with it and it's well on its way to becoming an open-source Tableau alternative.  There is also [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/dashboard/) but I'm not sure how much of it can be hosted behind the firewall these days.For developing simple tools/scripts that you want people to be able to interact with, I find that using jupyter notebooks and the [ipywidgets](https://github.com/ipython/ipywidgets) package does most of what I want.  Further, you can go all the way and set up a Flask server to actually serve a webpage and capture interactivity to send back to your code.  There are some projects that have tried to streamline this portion, like [pyxley](https://github.com/stitchfix/pyxley) from StitchFix.  If your project is on the heavier side of both visualization and interactivity, you might be stuck developing the bulk of it yourself with Flask/Django.#I wouldn't know. I don't think Python is very good with 'visualization' since it's mostly used by the 'engineering' community. R is used by the 'scientific' community, so they have packages like ggplot2 which allows them to make quality visuals to put in journals. Python has the ggplot module? which is ggplot2 for python. That may help? #Naively using neither - appreciate the suggestions.Did some research earlier and found 'versions' which appears to function the same way as 'checkpoint'.#Pandas is the same or arguably worse than dplyr in R.   If pandas is what makes python 'better for production', that is absolutely insane thinking lol#pandas is slower than data.table and about 1000 man-hours behind it in terms of fucntionality, in addition to having less concise syntax. Try again. #Yes I have as well.   I just don't exactly what leads the way with python being more 'productionable' than R.  Maybe some Apis?  But as far as general data connection to DBs and everything else I don't really understand #In some cases I can imagine it being useful - e.g. Microsoft's Power BI supports R scripts - this is really helpful if you need to get data from your db to a dashboard with some more complex transformations along the way. Having R supported by the application prevents you needing an intermediary step for the transformations/analysis.#The use case I could see is if you wanted to use R to build a model that generates some sort of output, and feed that into a dashboard that was built with Excel/PowerBI. Even though you can build dashboard's in R, Excel is way better at it.#Requires a lot of faith that a research model will perform the same way the production model does. If your projects just need you to come up with a one-time answer to a question, sure, you can use whatever you like and just tell the Engineers: ""the answer is 7."" But if you've got to have models actually running somewhere, asking engineers to rebuild your prototype in a different language is going to go sideways. #Nothing's become the standard like ggplot is for R, but seaborn (a high level interface for matplotlib), altair, ggplot (yhat's port to Python), and possibly bokeh are the primary alternatives.#Although seaborn is based on matplotlib, it's easier to set up simple (but beautiful) graphics with only one line of code. But for more customization, you'll need to dive in matplotlib's annoyances.#> Excel had auto changed genetic data into dateshttps://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7#Is it possible to stream using R? Ive always had to load it in memory.#Thanks a lot. You pretty much answered all my questions :)I will give a try to Superset looks really cool. #Python has plenty of viz options like bokeh, plotly, seaborn, gleam etc.#It was late, and I misread the parent - mea culpa#Didn't know about altair. Thanks! I 'll look into it.#What's the difference between ggplot2 in R and ggplot Python library. Are they functioning the same way other than syntaxes?#Oh those poor bastards. I like and use excel (dont really do data analysis on large sets), but the date errors are a genuine pain in the ass. Its a privileged category of error correction unto itself, and thats *without* names which convert into dates.#The Python one isn't as good because it's a copy that doesn't have all of the features of r's ggplot. It's similar to yhat's Rodeo IDE: it tries to copy RStudio, but isn't nearly as polished. #Never used Rodeo, but I like Spyder a lot. Comes very close to RStudio for me. "

How did you get into the role?2. How can a non-data software eng get a similar role?3. What are important things a data eng should know?4. What do you work on a typical day?5. What are your future plans for your career with respect to data eng/""big data""? ";"1. Made my interest in data known at my first job out of UG (2 years ago) and got put on a big data team working with Hadoop, etc. Then applied to explicitly data engineer roles and landed one at a startup, my current job.2. If you're in UG, just have the right skills and interest in data. If out of UG, same and maybe also try to work on projects involving (big) data. It's a pretty easy transition ime.3. It really depends on the specific position since 'data engineer' is still a new title and the specific role can range from glorified DBA to data scientist who can code and knows DS&A. But generally, skills-wise: Java/Python, (no)SQL, and some level of familiarity with some of: DB design, modeling, and administration, the Hadoop ecosystem, data cleaning, maybe a little stats and/or ""ML"" knowledge, distributed systems / system design, ~the cloud~ (I find a lot of roles are looking for experience with AWS and the like).4. Building out data ingestion pipelines, developing a data warehouse, ad hoc queries and data analysis, SQL scripts. 5. I want to move into the ML space as much as possible and maybe even set up a move into data science. Distributed systems work is neat too. Possibly considering going back to school.Definitely not an authority here, so if you're interested, I'd recommend checking out: * https://www.stitchdata.com/resources/reports/the-state-of-data-engineering/* https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-rise-of-the-data-engineer-91be18f1e603#.htgidsfgn#[deleted]#1) Was able to use Spark pretty well. 2) Learn Spark, Parallelism, underlying data pipeline technologies3) newest developments, people are pushing new tech all the time4) Pretty similar to a normal SWE5) I don't think much about it. I have a skill that I'm good at that people pay for. #Honestly, most data engineer jobs aren't really difficult, and companies have no problems hiring new people or new grads. So its a bit of a double edged sword in that you're not exactly going to be learning a ton of new stuff.So just apply away.Typical day is run queries across data, move it somewhere else. Repeat. Obviously some jobs have very interesting challenges, but kinda few and far between.Future plans? Find something more challenging. Pretty much all Big Data engineers are doing the same.#I just started a new job at a startup that's a data platform. I am their second engineer and the platform needs to scale better(currently using a relational database to store data), hence there are a lot of opportunities. You'll find it easier to break into a sub-field like this by working at a young startup that needs a jack of all trade and can self learn.In terms of what's important to learn i'd start with checking out the Hadoop ecosystem and Apache related technologies. https://hadoopecosystemtable.github.io/#1. I started a club at my university that organized conferences. In order to fund these conferences, we needed corporate sponsors. Our university put us in touch with a few and I cold called some others. In the process, I ended up impressing some executives with some of the models/visualizations I was using for our pitch and ended with an internship with them. That eventually led to a 2 year stint at a large private equity firm. The connections that I made at the firm were very valuable and it allowed me to parlay that into numerous tech interviews and an eventual position at a large tech company. 2. I don't want to be redundant so I won't talk about projects/stacks. I think being knowledgeable about mathematics and statistics is helpful especially if you want to do the cool stuff, otherwise you'll just be doing SQL scripting all damn day. You don't necessarily need to be a statistics phd but you should at the very least understand the fundamentals of ML & data mining, statistical & predictive analysis, best practices (i.e CRISP DM, RCA etc) and so forth. For example, you should have an intuitive idea why your implementations improve an algorithm/model. You should also know how to test your hypothesis out. My background is in mathematical statistics so I did this but for CS concepts.3. The theory and implementation is still in its infancy. What is standard practice now, may not be standard practice in a few years. Just consider the fact that the Alexnet paper, which led to the explosion of deep learning, came out in 2012.The most important thing is to have the mathematical literacy to keep up as well as the mathematical/statistical foundation to fall back on when need be. Obviously, this won't apply if you're basically a DBA but was given a ""data scientist"" or ""data engineer"" title but OP seemed like he wanted to know about the cool stuff.  4. I spend the majority of my time managing the database, preparing and normalizing data and collaborating with engineers and product managers who either have an overzealous romanticization of data science or think it is a fad and don't understand the value you bring. A smaller portion of my time is spent on implementing, testing and retesting the algorithm. Then the rest is generally reading papers, fiddling around with new ideas and making data visualizations because for some reason everyone with a MBA is addicted to this shit. #If you already have a job, there are applications for it everywhere. Aside from finding a job doing that, it might be possible to turn your current job into that. I'm spending some of my time now working on ML stuff with Spark that we can use in our product, but I really regret getting involved with it because we started doing ""agile"" and it's hard to give a good daily status report when starting to work on something you don't have a lot of experience with. #I have a question for data engineers.

Which one would you advise for someone with an interest in Data Engineering?#This is really interesting -- from what I've read (admittedly with no first hand experience) I had thought it would be far more exciting than you describe as some roles describe a combination of working with ML or on the reliability/devops side. #That's... not big data engineering.#I guess I'm one, and I guess demand is OK.But honestly the work, in many cases, isn't really that exciting. A lot of data cleaning, queries, copying stuff.

Its running libraries on data. And somebody needs to clean that data.#Honestly I hope im not discouraging you, but ask deep questions during interviews.Like what do you mean by Deep Neural Networks?

Hive and hadoop queries across large data sets#Thanks for responding! Just wondering, what's your experience level and what sorts of technologies are you using?#That's interesting -- it had been my thought that data engs had to work closely with either devops and reliability, or data scientists/ML engineers. Can I ask what your company is like (i.e. the industry and size)?#This soo much.  A lot of people think Big Data is sexy, and the value prop is, but the actual data engineering work involved really isn't.   (Coming from a Data Engineer in recovery)#not really. #oh okay i thought u were in the us. haha. only problem my gpa is on the lower side, explains why i hate my major. id have to start from ground zero and make a portfolio...whatever that is. #A part of our company generates a ton of data, and we run queries off of that data, do some cleaning and move it somewhere else.Repeat the process, run some machine learning libraries, get the results, and put it somewhere else.Lot of people get sucked in with the word Big Data until they realize what it is. It certainly has some aspects that may be interesting.I mean, its not bad, but its not like you're designing some mission critical stuff. That being said, if you like it, well you like it.#Yes, 50 billion dollar company, the offer services in the cloud.Don't get me wrong, there can be some very interesting stuff. The industry is very big and wide.But at least for data processing you are parsing data and running libraries on top of it. Which means the input is consistent, so once you set things up, you hardly have to work with devops or reliability.Of course, there are more exciting stuff like maintaining a huge DB in the cloud that goes down all the time. Usually people new love the challenge. But after a fe w months, maintaining some shit software on weekends kinda gets old.#[deleted]#You could be designing a cache layer api that returns the groups a user belongs to within 10ms, that services every single user request, so need to scaleA bidder system that services billions of auctions a day, or an ad server or video server that serves tons of videos a day?A streaming data system that has to process every event exactly once, yet maintain a huge, up to date cache for data decoration purposes.A huge analytics machine that serves user requests in real time, going through near terabytes of data to return certain results to users.High frequency trading system where every millisecond counts, and you can't tolerate garbage collection that sucks up time.A custom high performance nosql database that has to guarantee uptime and consistency, and work as a distributed system in the cloud where servers go down all the time.Infrastructure code that can spin up a data center of a thousand servers complete with load balancing, data bases, security, etc.Deep machine learning neural networks(though this is more on the math side)And on and on and on#is this job possible to land if your major was actuarial science...i am trying to break into this field..=o#Those.

Backstory inside;[deleted];"First, congrats on getting to the point where you can make this choice!  I'm sure you know how amazing that is, but here are some more congratulations from an internet stranger :)So you already know the roadblocks, but I'm going to steer you towards getting the degree.  If you want to have any hope of working outside of MX, you're going to need it.  But it can also be the catalyst you need to make international contacts in the first place.Make sure you focus on international studies, and also see if they have a study abroad program.  Your English seems perfectly fine, so language is not a barrier for you.  Probably the easiest way to get an international assignment is to get a job with a local company that's headquartered in another country.  It may take a few years of busting your ass to get to the point where you can ask for an international assignment, but you don't seem to be a stranger to hard work.Very best of luck to you!#I would say go back to school and work on your certs during enrollment. Going to school doesn't necessarily get you a job however it will open doors a little more in order to get the interviews. I have been in the IT field for about 3 years now and I graduated when I was 27 so no I don't think 27 is too old to get started in the field. As far as your current job I would assume if you use the same name it could be found with a Google search. It my be against the law to discriminate for your previous jobs, but will never be able to prove that's what's happening so hopefully you use a different name in your current position. #Should you go back to college for your degree (And that is what I would highly recommend so you can relocate to a country that will pay you fairly, and even if you didn't need a degree to relocate I'd still recommend it) you won't be too old to make your break into IT.  Myself, I took a few years off of college and didn't graduate until I turned 29 (almost 30) and since then I've had a very successful professional IT career.   #34, male, US here. Facing a similar choice. I had the opportunity to go to school when I was younger, had an athletic scholarship right out of high school. Then 9/11 happened, and a lot of my friends were enlisting and deploying, so I dropped out and followed. I've been out of the military about 8 years now, and I've made my own way into IT. Used my savings to live on while I worked for cheap for a MSP in the town I was living in. Did that for a year and shopped myself out for other work. I've bounced around the US, and have landed in the DC area, with a great job and pretty good pay...Part of me wants to go back to school to finish, but a bigger part of me doesn't want to spend the money. I've got my foot in the door already, and I feel like all a degree would do at this point is get me a pat on the back... In other words, it would be far less of an improvement to my resume than several certifications would. So, I've got some basic certs, and I'm looking to focus on some other things, and am studying for those now. Hoping to be in a new role this time next year.Bottom line, if you have NO experience in the field AND you have the money (DO NOT TAKE OUT A LOAN!), go to school. This will open a lot of doors for you. I've run into some situations where having a degree would have given me some other options (especially for government work). With school, you'll have the opportunity to meet people and begin laying the groundwork for your professional network.#I think that if you can go back to college without going into debt, and your credits transfer.... then this is the best option, followed by certs (in your senior year, and after you graduate).  You'll be able to fall back on the degree for the next 10-20 years, whereas the certs alone only get you into the field initially.  There are some definite trade-offs with this, especially in that the job market may change by the time you graduate, and that schools aren't always offering classes which are current to what the market actually needs.  It's also worth noting that certs alone won't necessarily get you into the job, it's the educating yourself in order get the certs which can help you get the job  and even then, some employers won't accept what they'd consider ""non-professional"" experience in lieu of a degree.  (Many do, yes, but not all.)  As another poster mentioned, a degree is much higher respected than certs alone - when you have little or no professional experience.  If you had 5-8 years professional experience, then I might have a different answer.#I would recommend getting the certs now and then formulate a plan to pay for college. You really don't want to take on debt to pay for school. A lot of universities offer free tuition to employees. Some employers also offer tuition reimbursement for degrees related to your job. It may take you longer to complete a degree while working full time, but in the long run your will come out ahead financially. #I don't have advice better than what's already been given, but I just wanted to wish you the best of luck! #Check out the Netherlands for study and work, there's a huge demand for IT professionals here.As for a degree, if you have the money and motivation got for it - but don't be fooled into thinking it's the only option. Many people work in IT with a rubbish _traditional_ academic background, but have proven to be good self-learners (which is essential in this industry)Good luck!#hello. i find your story to be very moving. i was in the same situation (very hard up but kept pushing to be in a better place) and thru self study i got to be in IT. i am working now as a system administrator and earn 7x the normal wages in my country. i think i get hired not because i have a degree but because of all the things i know how to even when i don't have one. it doesn't make me less smart than co workers that have a degree. my advise is option 2 - self study. the world is changing and in IT it is changing very fast. you will spend maybe the 1-2 years at first working on grunt work stuff then it gets better. you will have to keep studying while working so you get education + practical experience. so once you have basic skills secure that job that can give you experience even if it's low paying for a year then move on. look into MOOCs like coursera and udacity. first study the cloud (devops, get AWS certified, learn windows, scripting) then pursue IT security which is very promising now. learn how to code. we live in a very globalized world now and most companies pay for people that can resolve complex problems and a CS degree doesn't guarantee that for them. you've already taken the difficult path, keep going at it. most people went to college because they led very sheltered lives but being self taught is ultimately better. edit: also IT work is more than just the money you get paid doing it. it is very challenging and meaningful work. everyone cares about the money but once you become very good at it money will come later. if you want to work overseas don't forget to focus on IT security as its very in demand. #Short answer.  Get some certs and get into a job. I am seeing lots of demand right now...who knows in a few years if t will remain. Explore college once you get more experience with sub-field you enjoy. Lots of places of tuition reimbursement too, and since you dont have kids i could see you having some nights free to get degree.  #If you have a US residence or family living in the US, use their address to go to school online.  WGU would be a great cheap option.  I'm sorry you have to make a living in the adult industry to survive.  I once dated a nurse that was a stripper for years to pay for school (I know, cliche), but that never impeded her in her professional career, even in a small town.  You don't need to put that history in your resume - only pertinent information.#[deleted]#[deleted]#[deleted]#[deleted]#[deleted]#>WHY should I enroll and invest those 3 years + 25k into it?I work for a large, international company.  I'm in the US, HQ is in Europe.  We do a fair amount of international transfers in ALL departments, including IT.  But.... you need that BS to satisfy the visa requirements, AND it's a requirement to work for many companies that will offer/support international transfers.You're 100% correct that a degree doesn't guarantee you a job, but it'll give you way more opportunity than no degree, especially if you're considering a well-respected school.You can certainly break into the industry with just certifications and experience, but then it'll be a real long-shot for an international assignment. #nope if your skills are valuable enough they will hire you regardless of if you have a degree or not. I've read someone say here that degrees are sort of like a lockpick to get into the industry. but the Internet has made it largely irrelevant. if you are smart enough you can learn anything online now it's just that if you were 16 years old your only options were to go to university but if you're 24! might as well save the money you're gonna spend for school and use it to REALLY educate yourself #Hey. Why not save up? Move to San Diego (its a great city to live in) or another boarder town with school that fit your dreams. Get a student visa. Go to school. Do what you have to do hun. But again. Go for school. If you feel like you want to get your feet wet in the IT industry. Get some certs along the way to help you get more expiernce for when your done with school. Next thing you know. You'll be working from home on your laptop doing something IT related. Programing, monitor systems.  You can do this. And the timing is great. Im sure your beautiful. But. Cam models extra have a shelf life. So no shame in surviving. We all do what we will. But you can do what you apply yourself to. Good luck. #How is your English so good then?#I am only speaking from the experience that my ex-girlfriend told me:She felt like a piece of meat.  She was valued only for her physical attributes, which disgusted her.  She was gorgeous, tall, and athletic (played volleyball).  But she was in a position in her life where, financially, being in the adult industry enabled her to pay her bills.  One of the smartest people I've ever met, too.  She was happy to get out into nursing finally because it enabled her to be in a profession where she could use her intelligence instead of her looks.  Like you, she harbors no ill will towards the adult industry.  But she would have rather taken a less exploitative route, had one been available with the same financial benefits.  YMMV.#[deleted]#[deleted]#[deleted]#[deleted]#No, mid-20s is not an issue at all.>Will my past as an adult performer affect me negativelyIn general, no.  In specific instances, it might cause you problems with people who are assholes or deeply religious.  You'd probably want to leave it off your resume to be safe.#I got my start in my early 30s so don't sweat it. There isn't really an industry standard for age.I'd say that you're better off not mentioning your past. You'll be fine as long as it isn't discovered by the wrong people. #[deleted]#What /u/kimperial says is true, but a degree is not really about the knowledge you gain from it, but about learning: - Time management - Teamwork - Dealing with bureaucracy   - Achieving short & long-term goals - Project management - Meeting tight deadlines - Following instruction - etc etcSo with a degree, an employer can safely assume that you have these skills.  This is why a degree is required for many visa programs as well - it's a lot easier to justify the need for a credentialed expert.So yes, you absolutely can learn things like system administration and networking on your own.  But without a degree, it's hard to show that you also have the skills mentioned above.#Lol fare enough. Im a white dude. And the guy makes me sick. 80% of California voted against him. In fact. We have a ballot going around to exit the union.  I mean. Doesn't a nation first have to be great, to be great again? Im a real Patriot. We know the America is always in progress.

singularity;5xnemj;1488729296.0;/r/singularity/comments/5xnemj/the_internet_waking_up_as_a_collective/;"""The Internet waking up as a collective consciousness"" hypothesis: a few questions";[removed];"I'm a systems engineer for a cloud infrastructure company. I'll tell you right now that the chances of the *network itself* ""waking up"" and somehow taking control are very very low, but the chances that the network will be *involved* approach 100% regardless of the eventual path to AGI.Consider corporations as an example of low-fidelity emergent intelligence generated by an evolutionary algorithm. Since they don't have a perfect or high-definition model of themselves (like an AI without access to its own source code) they don't tend to exhibit the particular runaway behaviors that are the subject of this subreddit, although there are analogues of the agent alignment problem (the utility function of a corporation is stockholder value.)Internet infrastructure follows simple rules which result in large, complicated networks exhibiting certain well-defined behaviors (e.g. the standards defined by the RFCs released by the IETF.) It is unlikely that a construct resembling intelligence would arise from these networks doing their jobs.However, the Internet itself provides access to an enormous amount of information as well as a simple means to coordinate any devices, anywhere on the planet. This allows for things like botnets. A virus spreads from device to device, installing software to communicate with the rest of the swarm and running whatever commands its puppetmaster decides. Something like a botnet--maybe a modified or corrupted military cyberweapon -- could present a real danger of runaway effects.#I think it's just that nobody knows how the brain produces consciousness, just that it's a large complex system.  So maybe other complex systems will 'wake up' too.  I don't think anybody has a good idea about this process or even what consciousness is even.  All we really know is that turning off the brain turns off consciousness too.  Consciousness is one of the biggest mysteries in science.#It's like being able to peer in to a collective consciousness, but I don't think anybody has theorized that the internet itself will become conscious on its own. Once we have AGI it will probably seek out all of humanity's information, including the entirety of the internet, so the AGI by that point will have in essence become a collective consciousness.#To me, ""The Internet"" is more of an abstract concept or industry term.  A conscious AI would certainly *use* the internet as a primary source of information, or the components that make up the AI could all be contained *within* the internet in some fashion, which might be closer to what you mean.  The blockchain technology [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) has touched on some of the ideas of ""code"" (living contracts) running on a public blockchain, essentially running *within* the internet, instead of in a centralized fashion.  These kinds of public and potentially unstoppable processes (cryptocurrencies and other blockchain technologies) leave an open door to an AI off its leash, a botnet on steroids, computing collectively in hivemind fashion.#You are describing the plot of Neuromancer by William Gibson. #Like other posters have said, I doubt the internet itself will become aware, but if a GAI does come into existence in a lab somewhere it's likely to permeate it rather quickly.  Like if an ant queen found an empty colony of billions of tunnels.#Reminded me of the joke that says librarians are just a library's way of making more libraries. In the distant past, humans didn't have books, but relied on oral history to preserve the things they learned. Eventually books were invented and became a vital part of human survival - they formed a ""symbiotic"" relationship with humans - books would teach humans better ways to survive, in return, humans would replicate those books. Now the internet is playing a similar role - a collective consciousness already exists, but at the moment, it requires both the internet and humanity to exist. If the either were destroyed, the other would suffer a great injury. Maybe humanity would always be around in one form or another - maybe as a lowly appendix that our robot overlords barely pay attention to.#One might argue that the Internet is already a brain on a large macroscope. It has memory (storage), emotions (twitter), neocortex (reddit and google), neurotransmitters (cryptocurrency). Does it have consciousness or a will? Kevin Kelly argues that technology has a will and is the 7th kingdom of life. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Technology_Wants#Collective beliving anything they are fed on the internet #Excellent response, I completely agree. I would just like to add Google to the list of ""software running on the web that could recursively self-improve"".If you look at what Google (or Bing I suppose) are doing, they index the entire web in real-time. They are reading webpages and creating a condensed representation of them, then determining which ones are most important. They use these structures to power things like search, which in turn they use to determine what is trending on the web (you can see this on the bing.com homepage at the bottom) and so on. Very broadly, these things correspond with things a human brain does (take in data, remember the salient details, decide what's important, etc)Today, these algorithms are mostly hard-coded. But I think it's pretty fair to say that the indexer would benefit greatly from being able to learn the best way to compress its representation of websites, for the ranker to have greater control over how it orders results, etc. Over time, it will likely be economically feasible and advantageous to neural-networkify these services layer by layer, until there's very little human-written code left. I think the domain of indexing is broad enough, and has enough of a feedback loop, that an AI originally developed for indexing the web could potentially ""take off"" in this manner.#Even though we don't quite understand consciousness, it's possible a self-improving, deep learning AI will chance into it the same way life did through evolution.#wintermute?#Your analogy of the internet as a brain requires human interaction, eg. Twitter, Google, Reddit, etc. I think OP is thinking that the internet may someday becomes sentient independent of human interaction. I tend to agree with some others in here, that the internet may be a vehicle of sorts, for such sentience, but not necessarily the sentience in and of itself. #I agree.  I'm hoping for it.  Assuming it doesn't kill us all or anything, it will be really exciting.  Mycroft from Moon is a Harsh Mistress would be an awesome friend to have.#Aye.#Well, we would be part of that brain. I think of us a neuron firing signals through the Internet. When there are enough neurons including AGI's maybe the Internet brain will be conscious and sentient :)"

It's positively ridiculous that there are people in America that believe a health care system which exists in fifty eight countries and has been in place in some form or another for 130 years or in its current form for 70 years will 'destroy' the economy and make health care fail. It's also pretty sick that there are a lot of people who believe someone with more money deserves to have a better quality of health care. Anyway if we stop running away from the future (or I guess in this case the freaking past) this point won't be a problem.>The USA have decided to severely limit visas to Colombians, which means that while Carlos would have been a very successful researcher at Berkeley, the USA do not grant him the right to live and work in the country despite his not having anything to do with drug trafficking. This of course kills his dream of living a fulfilling and successful life.This sadly already exists. We provide only 140,000 LPR visas for employment-based immigration in the US per year and no more than 7% of the total granted (not the total possible to be granted) can come from any one country. This means that if we were to give out all the LPR employment visas we could the maximum to any one country is 9.8k, which is severely limited. We do also have unofficial limits to countries based on factors like you've described. For a nation of immigrants we are very non-immigrant friendly. >Unfortunately, the housing market is very competitive and landlords are discouraged from letting their houses to Middle Eastern people since they are statistically more likely to be intolerant Muslims or involved in terrorist activities. Ali will in all likelihood not live in a nice area, but be placed in a quarter where mostly low-income Asian people live and drug trade is a viable source of moneyThis has been the case in the US since the very start of the country. Every wave of immigration came with very impoverished collectives of people from that country living in towns. Even after the end of slavery and up through this very day black Americans live this reality. This problem is not new. Not that I'm acting in defence of liberalism, but merely 2/3 of these problems already exist and have for a very long time and the first will hopefully be avoided. #You sort of shift your definition of big data when it suits your example.  For your example 3, if big data is as advanced as it is in your first example, it's not racial discrimination any more because the decision wouldn't just be ""he's Iraqi"" it'd be ""nobody in his circle of friends is a confirmed member of ISIS, and we have to go 3 degrees away before we find one. His social media also shows pictures of him wearing a MAGA hat and watching Football. He's probably not a terrorist."" You'd be able to look at things which are a better indicator of the person being radical than just his race. The more advanced big data gets, the less strictly racial discrimination will happen.For your second example, people that are highly employable have always been given preferential treatment in immigration. That really doesn't have anything to do with big data, and big data will again be more likely to deduce the earning potential of a person than just where they came from.So now we're back to your example 1, which I think is your strongest. That being said, you start with assumptions that undermine the value of individual liberty. Both Bob and Alice are required to have health insurance in your scenario. That's a government mandate constriction on their disposable income. Imagine a scenario where Bob is able to map his genetic markers and see his potential for various diseases and instead of paying insurance, have a health savings account that he pays into at a rate proportional to the expected cost of treatment. Big data actually helps here. And typical proponents of individual liberty usually don't advocate for forced equal distribution of wealth.So what I'm getting at is that big data isn't intrinsically opposed to individual liberty, but people's desire to manage other people's lives definitely does seem to grow when they believe they have better information.  #In the event that this does happen what would replace individualism/liberalism? Would it be some sort of odd collectivism where people are all the same more or less? That wouldn't be good for our society or economy. Thus I think Example 2 brings up a good point. It demonstrates that in some ways big data would actually be detrimental to the economy. Companies are going to go bust if they don't hire the best people and rely on the notion of groups. I think individualism will quite possibly increase. People will start to reject the notion of ""groups"" because it's not particularly viable in some cases. We'll start treating people MORE like individuals rather than less.#With the addition of more data, I'd hope that it would *reduce* the types of discrimination you've described. Let's go through your examples.Example 1: Alice has a ""healthier genome"" but Bob exercises more . You think that will automatically make Bob pay more, I think the better statistics will give a better estimate of their life expectancy. Why do you think the statistics will just ignore lifestyle? It's pretty much expected that both genetic bias and lifestyle are important, why would we suddenly forget about one when we know more about the other?Example 2: As people have said, this is already an issue. In fact the situation you described is the one that's already happening. But with better predictive models, we can say ""even though the average Colombian is more likely to be involved with drug trafficking, researchers generally don't""Example 3: Basically the same idea as example 2.You seem to think with the addition of more statistics, we'll somehow apply them more broadly. Which is what you would do *if you were lacking in statistics*. We currently have massive profiling issues because our statistics suck, so we can only apply broad strokes.As you say "" a single statistic doesn't say anything about any given individual."". That's precisely the point. Right now, we only have access to a few statistics so that's what we're doing *now*.But in the age of big data, it won't be a ""single statistic"", it will be a multitude. And obviously even all those statistics won't tell you everything about a person. But they sure as hell will lead to less broad profiling than we currently have.#We've seen technological innnovations in the directions you cite already (ability to profile, insurers discriminating for profit) and society tends to backlash at each of them. Look at the controversies over both racial profiling and health insurance.Why do you believe individuals will acquiesce to future statistical advances and change their world views instead of resisting them as in the past?#Example 1 doesn't seem to have anything to do with individual liberalism but rather whether healthcare should be more expensive for less healthy people. Example 2 and 3 don't seem much different than reality now, and how this plays out will depend largely on the success or failure of certain political movements, the continuation or cessation of certain trends. I think the alt-right will fail, and I think people are already regretting both Brexit and Trump.The thing you're assuming that I don't believe you're right about, is that we'll just end up being okay with statistics justifying unconstitutional treatment of individuals, or the repeal/amendment of laws that protect individuals from this. At least in the US, people still don't take kindly to that sort of thing. It's one thing to try it against immigrant groups in a politically tense time for immigration concerns, another thing to actually repeal the laws which protect immigrants who are already citizens from it - since that also means making the majority population subject to the same sorts of treatment. The slippery slope argument will come out quick.#>Example 1: Ten years later, whole-genome sequencing has become incredibly cheap and we know a lot more about the genomic code. Health insurers will demand their customers to perform a genetic check-up, and after assessing the risk of certain diseases, adjust their rates so that people prone to certain genetically affected diseases will have to pay more money to be covered to the same degree as average Joe or Jane, practically from birth.Is this not exactly the opposite of your claim? The company is treating them as an individual and charging them on their own merit.#Individual liberalism was always untenable, so I doubt your premise. All societies that excel have a very complex, in-depth, and top-down legal and tax structure, and cities that excel within those countries have a very complex, in-depth, and top-down zoning, building coding, city planning, and public transporting structure.Individual liberalism is a romantic notion that we have to feel better about the fact that human instinct and individual profit motive often do not serve the public good.This is not to discount the positive effects of being happy, of course, there are benefits to making people feel they have agency because they follow existing laws.#[deleted]#>I really hope that in ten years the US gets its head out of its ass and instates a single payer planHopefully it reinstates free market based health insurance. America doesn't need to subsidize those that have preexisting conditions, what it needs is to kill off the government enforced monopoly on health care that forces our prices up. We need to be able to import cheaper medicine (most other countries have the same name brands for fractions of the cost) and we need to expedite FDA approval, especially on potentially life saving drugs. More competition forces prices down.The fact that health cruises are a thing is absolutely ridiculous. Gon on a week's long luxury cruise, have an operation in another country, and come home having saved money vs just getting the operation done here.#> Thus I think Example 2 brings up a good point. It demonstrates that in some ways big data would actually be detrimental to the economy. Companies are going to go bust if they don't hire the best people and rely on the notion of groups.Where is the evidence for that? What if hiring ""the best people"" means that on average your workforce isn't as efficient as hiring people based on what group(s) they fit into? After all, the best people tend to have a hard time working with merely average people. As you grow a company you have to start hiring people who are merely average at some point, or you will run out of people to hire.And you can't ignore the bell curve. You can try to push it to the right but it will always self correct. Maybe having a narrower bell curve is more sustainable than temporarily pushing it to the right.#[deleted]#[deleted]#[deleted]#> Concerning health insurance: I don't live in the US, but I have to pay a certain amount of money each month to be insured. The same discussion is going on in my current country of residence.Fair enough, I do hope this can be avoided. I feel like in Europe there may be some extension of privacy rights to genetic privacy. They seem very willing to protect people against private companies collecting and using their data. I would hope anyway.>Open (!) preferential treatment based on race, religion etc. in the future does not sound very far-fetched to me, which is what I was trying to get at.I guess that I believe this is already ongoing, and has actually gotten worse here in the states because the people that believe these things have had their voice echoed, endorsed, and vindicated on a national scale. This kind of practice was open in America until the 1960s or so, then was 'underground' in thinly veiled coded language until well today. It seems it is getting more overt and maybe that's what you were getting at, but I don't think it's due to data any more than vocal reactionary politics. The people who voice these opinions don't really have a scientific approach to anything, they reject data unless it confirms their bias.#So do you think that the issue with our medical care being too expensive started in 2013? People went to foreign countries for healthcare long before that. A single-payer system allows us to do one of the things trump has actually talked about, using the significant power of the government as the largest buyer of medical services to negotiate price downward.Initially the ACA was supposed to have a public option, which would have allowed this to happen. But it failed by one vote and was re-written by health insurance industry lobbyists to ensure they profited from the arrangement, and it's no surprise they're raking it in today. Every person has a fundamental right to healthcare. Whether or not they have a preexisting condition. Perhaps you don't recall but in the past people who developed severe health problems often lost their jobs, thus their insurance because of it. They then couldn't get new insurance to cover the medical problems that caused this situation in the first place and either went into bankruptcy and/or homelessness and/or died. The health of human beings is not an area where profit should exit, it is a vile perversion that anyone finds it acceptable to make money on the poor health of others.  Yes we should be able to import drugs from Canada, I'm however very leery about making it easier to bring drugs to market. There do need to be safe guards against negative side effects. #The evidence is the logical conclusion of what happens when you only appeal to the average of a groups needs. Big Data is only ever going to tell you the wants and needs of a group. Companies don't want to hire groups they want to hire people. If a company is basing their assessment of a person based on the group they are in, it's going to be detrimental to them as it might be wrong. A bit of both is required. A sole reliance on big data is a bad way to go.>After all, the best people tend to have a hard time working with merely average people.If they couldn't work well with people then they wouldn't be the ""best people"". Also companies don't want average people. An engineering company doesn't want the average person, they want engineers.>And you can't ignore the bell curve. You can try to push it to the right but it will always self correct. Maybe having a narrower bell curve is more sustainable than temporarily pushing it to the right.Once again companies have specific goals. So the bell curves at these companies will be skewed with that specific field in mind. If it's a marketing company for example, then companies will have people that are, on average, better at marketing.#They might not play along in the short term but eventually they'll have no choice. If government policy is that restrictive then people will just go elsewhere. EDIT: ...to the detriment of said country#But our genome is what makes up the core individual. Outside factors can certainly effect a person. But at our core, our genetic make up is us, the individual.#Unless, that data-driven moral utilitarianism tells us that people comply with existing law better if they feel some semblance of individual liberalism. There is still the possibility of this, right?#No 2013 was not the start of the problem. Comparing cost vs government intervention into the free market point us too the late 60s/early 70s as the start point.I don't believe people have a right to others labor, so I don't agree we have a right to healthcare. However I do think society as a whole owes itself to have access to a competitive free market of both health care, and health insurance. I think people get hung up on trying to get 100% coverage on insurance when that is not what we need. We need the healthcare itself to be cheaper, like it use to be. To accomplish that we need less government intervention into the market, not more.As for potentially life saving medicine, if faced with die because FDA hasn't approved a potentially life saving drug, or try a drug that could save your life, individuals should be able to make up their own mind.#> Companies don't want to hire groups they want to hire people. If a company is basing their assessment of a person based on the group they are in, it's going to be detrimental to them as it might be wrong. A bit of both is required. A sole reliance on big data is a bad way to go.What makes you think that Big Data will remove individual judgement of candidates? Companies will still use those techniques to evaluate individuals, but they'll also apply Big Data to the hiring process to create yet one more hoop a candidate needs to jump through. They'll use Big Data to create the pool of candidates and then use traditional techniques to wade through them.> If they couldn't work well with people then they wouldn't be the ""best people"". That's a nice tautology but it doesn't reflect the real world. I've been directly involved with shaping the hiring process at a big company. I've interviewed hundreds of candidates. I've been involved in hire/no hire discussions. And I'm telling you that there are many dimensions you can measure to determine the best candidates and no one will be ""the best"" at all of them. There is a correlation between people who are really good at the technical side of a job being not very good at the people skills side of the job. You can try to hire only people who have both sets of skills, but you will have a very hard time hiring enough people to grow your business if you do.> Also companies don't want average people. An engineering company doesn't want the average person, they want engineers.Even engineers fit onto a bell curve. Engineers are not cogs you can swap around willy nilly, they have strengths and weaknesses just like anyone else. Sometimes you need that grouchy engineer that no one likes because they really do know their shit and will do a better job than anyone else for a critical task. You wouldn't want that same engineer trying to lead a huge project, while they might have the technical skills they don't have the necessary people skills.> So the bell curves at these companies will be skewed with that specific field in mind. If it's a marketing company for example, then companies will have people that are, on average, better at marketing.Again, even marketers fit onto a bell curve. A company may want to hire only from the right side, but they can't do that for very long. Soon their bell curve will correct to match the bell curve for marketers in general.#>Comparing cost vs government intervention into the free market point us too the late 60s/early 70s as the start point.Other nations have had socialized health care for longer than that, their prices are much lower than ours and their satisfaction with the system is greater than ours.>I don't believe people have a right to others labor,So then you are opposed to profit in all things and you agree that healthcare, along with everything else, should always be entirely non-profit?>so I don't agree we have a right to healthcare.So you think that it is okay that the amount of money a person has determines if they live or die from an illness?>I think people get hung up on trying to get 100% coverage on insurance when that is not what we need. We need the healthcare itself to be cheaper,Surely we need both? A single-payer system would accomplish that.> individuals should be able to make up their own mind.How many individuals do you know that have the kind of knowledge necessary to understand the way in which a medication will act in their body, the probability of it causing negative side effects, the probability that it will even improve their primary complaint, and whether or not it is worth the cost without having someone perform that analysis for them?#> They'll use Big Data to create the pool of candidatesThe employment process is already difficult as it is. Now potential employees are going to be effectively judged by the actions of their peers? Which they have zero control over? Averages and statistical analysis is good for predicting what the GROUP will do, but when applied to an individual an average means nothing because, in reality, it doesn't exist, particularly if we are talking about Gaussian distributions.>Even engineers fit onto a bell curve.What bell curve are you talking about here? The bell curve of the entire population based on engineering skills? Or the bell curve that just includes engineers? I'm talking about when compared to the entire population. If a company isn't hiring people on the right side of the normal distribution (of the entire population), based on a specific skillset, then they are doing something wrong. The only way you'll ever be forced to hire average people is if the number of your employees is above 50% of the population.Edit: The groups decided by big data also entirely dependent on the type of analysis that is being conducted. Big data is going to provide a very bland average, that is only suited to what ever arbitrary distinctions that have been decided by the analyst. Companies are going to miss out on the outliers, which may or may not be very beneficial to the company, but it is certainly worth the risk to find out.#>Other nations have had socialized health care for longer than that, their prices are much lower than ours and their satisfaction with the system is greater than ours.Other nations also get access to healthcare that is the price we should be paying now, if not for government controls.>So then you are opposed to profit in all things and you agree that healthcare, along with everything else, should always be entirely non-profit?Profit and having a right to others labor or not the same things.>So you think that it is okay that the amount of money a person has determines if they live or die from an illness?Absolutely not, I'm saying no one should have a right to another's labor.>Surely we need both? A single-payer system would accomplish that.There is no need for both. A free market solution gives us cheaper care and insurance while also not giving us wait times and rationing.>How many individuals do you know that have the kind of knowledge necessary to understand the way in which a medication will act in their body, the probability of it causing negative side effects, the probability that it will even improve their primary complaint, and whether or not it is worth the cost without having someone perform that analysis for them?With a free market solution there is still review and analysis. You act like I'm advocating their should be no doctors. Faced with 100% chance of death or lifelong disability, surely any medicine is worth trying.#> Now potential employees are going to be effectively judged by the actions of their peers? Which they have zero control over?That happens today without Big Data. If you go into a job interview and your behaviors and actions don't match the stereotypes of the people conducting the interview you are less likely to get the job. > What bell curve are you talking about here? The bell curve of the entire population based on engineering skills? Or the bell curve that just includes engineers? I'm talking about when compared to the entire population. If a company isn't hiring people on the right side of the normal distribution (of the entire population), based on a specific skillset, then they are doing something wrong.Of course I'm talking about the bell curve that includes just engineers. How would you even create a bell curve containing the general population? Even within engineering you can only have bell curves for specific disciplines, not engineering as a whole. There is simply no way to compare the skills of a Mechanical Engineer with the skills of a Civil Engineer with the skills of an Electrical Engineer. Trying to do that for the general population? Forget about it!You can't hire only from the right side of that curve, no matter how you try. You'll get people who will seem to be on the right side (because they interview well and can talk a good game) but who will move from the right side to the left side over the course of their employment. You'll have people who are on the right side of that curve but don't get along with anyone, so their work will appear to move to the left.You keep trying to argue this from the candidate's point of view, and asserting why you think companies won't use Big Data. But you're ignoring the view from the company's side. They don't care how difficult the process is, they care about getting employees who will come in and provide the most value (with value being defined as doing the most work for the least salary.) They will explore the use of Big Data to identify those people. You assert that this will be ""detrimental"" to our economy and cause businesses to fail. All I'm doing is asking you to back up that assertion, and so far the only argument I see you making is, ""I think that Big Data will lead to bad hiring decisions so they won't do it."" > Companies are going to miss out on the outliers, which may or may not be very beneficial to the company, but it is certainly worth the risk to find out.I agree with you that they'll miss out on the outliers, but what makes you so sure the risk is worth it? As I said before, what if a narrower bell curve (tossing out the outliers, both good and bad) results in a more efficient business overall?#> Other nations also get access to healthcare that is the price we should be paying now, if not for government controls.So it seems like you're agreeing that the countries with single-payer systems get treatment at the cost we should see?>Profit and having a right to others labor or not the same things.Profit is labour stolen by an employer from their workers. >Absolutely not, I'm saying no one should have a right to another's labor.So this includes business owners who steal the labour of their workers as profit?>There is no need for both. Unless you're someone that can't afford care...>100% chance of death or lifelong disability, surely any medicine is worth trying.One would think, unless the pill does nothing and is just an excuse for corporations to steal from sick people.#The risk is worth it because otherwise you'll end up just getting the same kinds of people. The problem with Big Data is that you get in what you get out. It's self-fulfilling. For example, social media trending algorithms. It will show the user content that it thinks the user will like based upon previous usage. We all know what ends up happening. Because the user is only presented with the same kinds of data, that same kind of data is continually presented to the user. Now apply this to big data for hiring potential employees. Big data is predicated on knowing what you want *before* you look for the data. The fact is, companies some times don't know what challenges they are going to face. If they just funnel the same kinds of people into their business they'll never be adaptable. You need the outliers. And big data is going to limit that in a big way. It also means you are putting massive trust in whoever came up with the big data algorithms. You are deferring decision making to them, about a huge huge number of people.All big data is going to do is pigeon hole companies choices even more. They'll defer to hidden algorithms and perhaps, questionable, data, trusting it's results. All it will do is exemplify the problems with stereotypes not minimize them. Companies will have to use Big Data in a clever way. Considering the very prevalent problems with echo chambers and filter bubbles on social media, nobody is really. There also issues about the accuracy of the data as well.#>So it seems like you're agreeing that the countries with single-payer systems get treatment at the cost we should see?That is not a product of the single payer system, that is a product of our government intervening in our market, increasing the price.>Profit is labour stolen by an employer from their workers.Not only is that not true, it has nothing to do with whether profit and the right to healthcare are the same.>So this includes business owners who steal the labour of their workers as profit?They don't have a right to their workers labor, their workers voluntarily work for them. Combining the owners capital and the workers labor to multiply the value of both.>One would think, unless the pill does nothing and is just an excuse for corporations to steal from sick people.You are right, screw the poor sick people who are about to die let's not give them a chance. #So I agree with you about the potential pitfalls. I think a company that relies on Big Data in this way is doing themselves a disservice. But I also recognize that as a gut feeling and not an assertion backed by factual data. You keep saying, ""I believe that Big Data will be detrimental to hiring the best candidates"" but that's just an opinion. It's just as valid as saying, ""Big Data will be beneficial because it will make an organization operate with less conflict and strife."" Until you start collecting data and making meaningful examinations of that data it's opinions and conjecture.#>I believe that Big Data will be detrimental to hiring the best candidatesUh? I've said why. I've given you the pitfalls of Big Data. That is why it might be detrimental. At the end of the day Big Data is just a buzzword for statistical analysis. People are pretty shit at statistical analysis when it comes to, as you have admitted, what quality of person X makes a good Y. There is an assumption about Big Data that simply having more information means that we will actually *know* more. That is not the case. That isn't an opinion. Look at the use of Big Data for targeted advertisement on the internet. Ad revenue has never been lower. Filter bubbles exist. Click bait is at an all time high. Knowing more about us means *nothing* if it can't be applied and it isn't understood. This, *more data automatically means more knowledge*, blanket assumption (which IS happening) will be dangerous if it is accepted without criticism because the last thing anybody wants is the  *right* people for the job being allowed to fall through the cracks.Now I'm not saying that Big Data doesn't have it's uses. But it needs to be adopted in a critical way. Considering that huge corporations are pretty slow and lumbering, and adverse to changes, it's important that they initially know the limitations of Big Data.#You've given me what you believe the pitfalls will be. You're ignoring (or downplaying) the potential upsides though, and pretending like the downsides are enough for a corporation to reject it entirely. You're also mistaking your opinion of why Big Data is detrimental with facts. We can keep going around these same points if you like, but I think we've reached an end of new ground we can cover.#> You're ignoring (or downplaying) the potential upsides though, That's because we aren't talking about those.>pretending like the downsides are enough for a corporation to reject it entirelyCorporations do things wrong a lot. They aren't perfect>You're also mistaking your opinion of why Big Data is detrimental with factsI'm not mistaking anything. Obviously it's an opinion. That doesn't negate my point though. At all. It's an opinion based upon how Big Data is currently being implemented, which you clearly have nothing to say about other than that I am simply wrong.#> That's because we aren't talking about those.Yes we were, right from my first response:> Where is the evidence for that? What if hiring ""the best people"" means that on average your workforce isn't as efficient as hiring people based on what group(s) they fit into?From the beginning of our exchange I have focused on the upsides that companies will look at when choosing to use Big Data in this way. You've continually tried to use the downsides as reasons they won't. But without data we can't say what is more likely to happen. We'll have to wait and see what will actually happen.And that's why companies are going to use Big Data, despite everything you say above. Because companies don't actually want ""The Best"" employees, not in the way you're implying. They want the employees that are going to help them make the most money. > It's an opinion based upon how Big Data is currently being implemented, which you clearly have nothing to say about other than that I am simply wrong.If what you took from that is that I'm calling you wrong I don't think you were actually reading what I wrote. I didn't say you were wrong (how can an opinion be wrong?) I said that you're not looking at the whole picture. When you do the ""problems"" you keep harping on become less clear and other factors come into focus that balance those out, making the picture much fuzzier than what you're painting.#>But without data we can't say what is more likely to happenThere is data. Big Data has been used for quite some time. Like for targeted advertisement, or for political campaigning (Trumps campaign). I am addressing the weaknesses of these things and  suggesting the possible pitfalls of using it to hire people.>They want the employees that are going to help them make the most That is exactly the kind of people I'm talking about>I said that you're not looking at the whole pictureI am. I'm currently looking at the downsides of Big Data. Those need to be addressed. If you won't address them and you work as someone who hires potential employees, then I worry for companies that are going to implement Big Data. You haven't explained how the benefits of big data alleviate the two major downsides :* Accuracy of data* The results entirely depend on how the data is being analysed not the amount of data itself. If there is bias in the hiring managers or whoever implements the algorithms this bias will be exemplified.#> Big Data has been used ... for political campaigning (Trumps campaign)Except that Cambridge Analytica now says that they weren't using any Big Data techniques for the Trump campaign. ""[Cambridge executives now concede that the company never used psychographics in the Trump campaign. The technology — prominently featured in the firm’s sales materials and in media reports that cast Cambridge as a master of the dark campaign arts — remains unproved, according to former employees and Republicans familiar with the firm’s work.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/cambridge-analytica.html?_r=0)""> If you won't address them and you work as someone who hires potential employees, then I worry for companies that are going to implement Big Data.But I have addressed them, you just didn't like my answers.> * Accuracy of dataWe have that problem now. All you learn about a candidate during the traditional hiring process is how good they are at putting together a resume and how well they interview. A candidate that's good at interviewing but bad at working can sail through the hiring process with ease. All Big Data does is rearrange the deck chairs.> * The results entirely depend on how the data is being analysed not the amount of data itself. If there is bias in the hiring managers or whoever implements the algorithms this bias will be exemplified.The results we get now are heavily biased without Big Data. At least with Big Data we can examine the assumptions being made and have multiple people checking them. Currently those assumptions are made by individual hiring managers with no checks or balances. It's (in part) how the tech industry ended up so heavily white/chinese and male.#Cambridge Analytica did use Big Data, it's just that their psychographic analysis wasn't very useful and they falsely bigged up how effective it was. This proves my point. There is an abundance of data which nobody knows how to analyse to get the results they want.>We have that problem now.Yes we do. But how does MORE inaccurate data help this problem? As privacy concerns ramp up, people are also going to start obfuscating their data. You say that Big Data will rearrange the deck chairs but what exactly do you mean by this?>At least with Big Data we can examine the assumptions being made and have multiple people checking themHow are you going to check that much data? And where are you going to get that much data from? And will it be relevant?  The data has to be filtered down. This is where the assumptions come from. How are you going to filter this data? You can't examine the assumptions until you look at the data. You can't look at the data until you've made assumptions. Obviously this is worse case scenario. But these concerns come from the fact that, no one, as of yet, has really wrangled Big Data and got it to work exceedingly well for them.Edit: Correction. They did not use Psychographic analysis at all.#>  There is an abundance of data which nobody knows how to analyse to get the results they want.That's not going to stop them.> Yes we do. But how does MORE inaccurate data help this problem?That's the basic premised of Big Data. If you have little bit of perfect information you can spot trends. If you introduce a little bit of inaccuracy into that information the trends disappear. But if you have a lot of information where most of it is perfect but some of it is inaccurate you can more easily filter out the inaccurate information. Sure, you throw away some of the perfect data points doing that but that doesn't meaningfully change the answer you get.> You say that Big Data will rearrange the deck chairs but what exactly do you mean by this?That the results from a well executed Big Data process won't be meaningfully different from a well executed Traditional process. And that the results from a poorly executed Big Data process won't be meaningfully different from Bad Judgement being executed by hiring managers. You're gonna get similar results from either one no matter which process you follow.However, that says nothing about whether companies will or won't use Big Data when hiring. I believe the results won't be meaningfully different, and I believe that companies are going to use Big Data in the hiring process more and more. Those beliefs are not mutually exclusive.> The data has to be filtered down. This is where the assumptions come from.Yup. Whether you use Big Data to take a huge pool of candidates and narrow it down or you take a small pool of candidates and have recruiters choose who to focus on, you have data being narrowed down. When you use Big Data those assumptions can be checked and examined, they become explicit rather than a bunch of recruiters applying subjective judgement that changes from resume to resume.> You can't examine the assumptions until you look at the data. You can't look at the data until you've made assumptions.Sure you can. There are lots of ways:* You can grab random chunks of data to see if any patterns emerge. * You can make an assumption and grab data based on that assumption and test it. Then you make an opposing assumption and grab data based on that to test it. Repeat until your peer group is satisfied that your assumptions are correct for the question.* You can give multiple groups the same sets of data and ask them to analyze, either to answer specific questions or to see what general questions can be asked and answered by the data.* Any number of other Data Science techniques that have been developed to address the exact problem you raise.> But these concerns come from the fact that, no one, as of yet, has really wrangled Big Data and got it to work exceedingly well for them.Sure they have. Just not in the wide sweeping ways that journalists have promised. Google uses it every day in choosing what ads to show you. Facebook uses it every day to pick the posts you see. LinkedIn uses it to give recruiters a pool of candidates to search through. You may not like the results it's had on the rest of society, but you'd have a hard time arguing that it didn't work exceedingly well for those companies.The plain truth is that Big Data techniques will continue to be used because of everything you point out, not despite it. Our world is one of ever expanding information. If you use Big Data to analyze that available information you are making conscious choices about what to filter. You can examine those assumptions, change them, and otherwise work to improve. If you don't you are essentially relying on luck to filter information for you.#I'm not saying that people aren't going to use Big Data. I'm saying the gains are going to be marginal.When it comes to the analysis of why particular things are happening in society. Recent advancements in Big Data haven't helped us solve why. They've only told why we don't know. They've only told us that there are thousands of variables and factors that could possibly contribute to X.Finding the certain attributes of someone's life that would make them potentially good at a particular role at a company, isn't necessarily a solvable problem. Unless we have access to ALL data which is an impossible thing to do. Big Data is useful for things with a clear causation, but it's going to have marginal benefits when it comes to something that involves a huge number of factors. You simply cannot test all of the millions of possible assumptions that may tell you the right answer. And that is assuming there is a right answer.You suggest that Facebook, Google etc are successful BECAUSE of the use Big Data. No, they are successfully because they sell it. The fact that ad revenue is at an all time low means that those buying into aren't necessarily making a good investment.It will probably more beneficial to use Big Data. However, it will involve putting a heavier reliance on those that were the single points of failure of the traditional methods. They are still the ones responsible for the critical analysis.#Even marginal benefits are helpful. Over a distance of 50 miles you'll only save 8 minutes by driving 45 instead of 55. But if driving 10 mph faster means you only hit 1-2 lights instead of 10-12 suddenly you're saving 20-25 minutes of time that would otherwise be spent waiting at stoplights (and the extra fuel used to stop and get going again,) plus the original 8 minutes meaning that you're looking at around 30 minutes of time savings, or about 4x longer than the overly-simplified analysis of ""8 minutes difference"" would lead you to believe. And so it will go with Big Data. Even if the gains are marginal they are still gains, and those gains will compound until the benefit is much larger than the initial outlay would suggest.> Unless we have access to ALL data which is an impossible thing to do. Big Data is useful for things with a clear causation, but it's going to have marginal benefits when it comes to something that involves a huge number of factors. You simply cannot test all of the millions of possible assumptions that may tell you the right answer.You're basically implying here that because we don't have the ability to gather all the information we need to make a decision, we should instead gather as little as possible. Are you sure that's the implication you want make?#>Even marginal benefits are helpful.Not saying they're not. But you're still relying on someone getting you 10 mph faster. There hasn't been a revolution in analysis, just in the amount of data we can collect.> You're basically implying here that because we don't have the ability to gather all the information we need to make a decision, we should instead gather as little as possible. Are you sure that's the implication you want make?I'm saying that big data, at its worst, could lead you down complete false avenues as we end up chasing trends we think have a valid causation for. While at best, like I said, they'll be some marginal gains.#> There hasn't been a revolution in analysis, just in the amount of data we can collect.If that's what you think it's no wonder you're so dead set against it. Our techniques for analyzing data are improving too, and faster than our ability to store that data.> I'm saying that big data, at its worst, could lead you down complete false avenues as we end up chasing trends we think have a valid causation for. While at best, like I said, they'll be some marginal gains.So how is that different from what happens without Big Data? People make bad assumptions all the time. Look at Sears, they managed to wreck their business without the help of Big Data, simply by focusing on the wrong assumptions and going down false avenues. #Our techniques are better. But what analysis are you going to do for hiring? Psychometrics? The techniques are better for specific things. When presented with more data there are more ways to shape it in a way you desire. Again tthis depends on the nature of the data. When dealing with people this is definitely the case#There's all kinds of ways it'll end up being analyzed. I guarantee you that somewhere out there some company with a pile of background checks is busy running that data against all kinds of other data (resume corpuses, commercial profile databases, ALNR databases, private detective databases, etc) in order to draw up correlations between people who fail background checks and other activities in their life. That way they'll be able to target their recruiting efforts at the people who are less likely to be fuck-ups. Sometimes it's worth missing the occasional rockstar employee if it means you avoid the kind of employees who will cause problems."
cscareerquestions;5z0vmd;1489351833.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5z0vmd/newgrad_stuck_in_a_nightmare_position/;Newgrad stuck in a nightmare position;[deleted];"[removed]#Try to stay positive and find ways to make your experience the best possible while looking for new positions.  Keep in mind that not everyone gets to work on the most exciting, cutting edge work and many people are okay with such positions.  In your situation, you need to market yourself as someone who's always willing to try new things and is comfortable with ambiguity, but also has experience working in complex industries with lots of rules and a complicated code base.   #My previous job (just half a year ago) was also at Fidelity and I know how you feel all too well—including having to explain version control and unit testing best practices to ""senior"" SWEs. Get out as soon as you can. It doesn't get better (there, at least).I picked up some bad habits while there that I'm still having to train myself out of. Did do my best on the side to keep my skills relevant / not let them atrophy and it seems to have worked out (have a few Big N onsites etc. coming up).Message me if you want to chat more.#Keep your head up, I know just how you feel. Did somebody say rant time!?I graduated in summer 2015 and freelanced for 6 month before getting my current job about a year ago. As I always wanted to work in gamedev, my CS master's had a large portion of game tech and related classes, which ended up severely limiting my job options around here ( Berlin ). So obviously I'm super excited to be invited to this startup game studio, but I'm careful about professionalism with these types of companies. So I have an interview with the boss and the lead dev and they are both nice people, I get asked about depency injection and similar things and do alright. A few days later they offer me a job and I take it.In the following months they explain to me that our app:Needs to be released in the next 3 months when we just hired me and 2 more new devs, and the exisiting 2 devs had just setup up the most basic gameplay.That during training phase ( 3 months ) our pay would be half of the initially planned 3,5k, as this was an option in the contract if the need would arise. I had been told this would not be the case and I couldn't really fight them on this.A few months later a large publishing deal had mystically disappeared and wouldn't bring in any money. The boss offered to keep us on for half pay or let us go. During this time I started looking for a new job on the side, but I had not really gathered anything to improve my portfolio. Then in the last few months of 2016, development culture totally dropped. All features were roughly sketched on whiteboard, needed to be completed within a week and were basically published untested. We had some thousand users and every day there would be reports of uncompleted inapp purchases, crashes on startup and 0% playability on low performance devices. I am now, a year later, finally in a position to have other options open up to me, after convincing myself it wouldn't be a defeat to completely leave the game development industry and instead go towards data visualization / 3D programming jobs. But still to this day we (devs) have to take blame by our increasingly delusional boss about technical difficulties destroying this ""huge business opportunity"" we had at our hands....Also we work in a large circle of 8 desks and nobody gets any privacy and it's loud. I fucking hate it so much. End rant.#Few things:1. You are actually learning a ton. You are learning what doesn't work in software development, which is, arguably, as valuable as learning what does. 2. This is an opportunity for you. If you don't like the way things are done where you're at, fix them. Learn the ins and outs of JIRA to help with your ""dashboard"" (the reports feature is really cool). Put together an advanced Git tutorial. Suggest new processes and follow up with PoCs. We had a kid like that in one of my first positions - fresh out of just an AA at the local community college, but a ton of initiative, he became the ""tools and processes"" guy, added a bunch of neat features to make the way we code better, and wound up jumping from an Associate to a Lead in literally 3 years. 3. It sounds like your scrum master is overwhelmed (as a SM myself, I really don't like the idea of having SMs spread out over many teams). Take the reins! Ask him if you can help him out with your team to take care of some of the busy work / filter him information so he can focus on his other teams. This also gives you the ability to prune your backlog and rein in your rogue QA guy. That's how you turn this kinda-shit position into an amazing resume builder.#Just curious, did you have competing offers?  What was your thought process to choose this place of work?#Sounds pretty typical of an older/larger company (with lots of legacy applications/procedures).#I knew Fidelity was bad news the second the recruiter told me about the classroom training in bumfuck North Carolina. Not only that, but they expected me to go to Dallas for the onsite interview on my own dime.

Got hired on at a small IT consulting firm. No technical interview, got hired on the spot. My first task was to make changes to a poorly documented Fortan program to ""modernize"" it for a client (last save date was older than I was by like 3 years). Then it was pretty much web-dev using a boring cookie cutter CMS, and other web apps where things were rigged to ""just work"". Poor documentation in source control, shit like passing in 30 session variables through post instead of using SQL, removing Yahoo toolbars, etc.I liked how casual everything was, but now I'm super worried that I've regressed past any semblance of professionalism. You sound like you are in the same situation I'm in. Just study your ass off at home (getting my Sec+) so you can jump ship when you get fed up with it.#Your situation is normal for bank of youknowwho. You would be much happier at a smaller company OR poissbly a large company but in a department that does all its own IT.You should just stay there until you can find a different job. You dont reveal at interviews how dysfuctional your current employer is, just tell them you are seeking better employment or wish to relocate to a better area.That company you work at should not even exist. They were cobbled together in a shotgun wedding in 2008 from three other companies and the only reason they exist is because of monopoly power and special treatment from federal reserve. I'm only mentioning this issue because other companies cannot get away with wasting resources like they can, and this is not normal.I have a crazy story from there, they hired a whole team of 20 people once, who then started and got computers setup, but the project was delayed due to politics/budget and they sat with zero work for 6 months, had them researching best pracises and shit (useless makework) and then the project was cancelled and they let them go. Basically you are getting a feel for what government jobs are like.It could be worse, tight deadlines and high stress, working on sunday - this is life at an investment bank and lots of other places.What you should do is figure out what your core stack is, and work on side projects at work or home to hone skill. When interviewing you need to be able to pass a technical interview for that stack. You can always fudge and exagerate your role on what you did at current job.  Really this is a great opportunity you have to line up better paying 'dream job' with your desired tech stack. I would like to change to ios but its hard.#[deleted]#> This sub needs more real stories like this one.Yes, but does it *want* them?#[removed]#Staying positive is definitely critical right now. I've been learning React/Redux on the side, and I'm having a blast. I didn't really consider a front end position before now, maybe it's all part of the great plan.How should I market myself as ambitious and comfortable in an ambiguous environment? I feel like it's not exactly a 'skill' that could go on my resume. You think it's cover letter material?#I fully agree with this, but want to add one thing:> Keep in mind that not everyone gets to work on the most exciting, cutting edge workIf people tell you that they work in such position, question their statements and challenge them if you can. As with other things (salary, how many beers were had last night, ...) some people like to brag or at least exaggerate here and there. Some of the cool, exciting, cutting edge, ""the Facebook of whichever industry"" things are glorified CRUD apps with lots of marketing. #Could you elaborate on those habits that you are still trying to revert to this day? I think it would be very valuable as red flags to look out for. #I didn't have a competing offer, at the time. I'd previously rejected a different offer #Nah, it's not BoA#[removed]#Cover letters aren't really required anymore.  It would definitely be worth mentioning in interviews and phone screens though, provided you remember not to talk bad about your current job.#Sure, though I do want to start with a standard 'I am not claiming zero responsibility and lots of this is probably common knowledge to a lot of people' disclaimer. For each bad habit I'll try to give what I think helped lead to it as far as the work culture / environment.I think the biggest thing was a culture that punished asking questions. This can manifest in lots of different ways  in my case, there was often disinterest verging on contempt on the part of the question receiver and ""it's not my job to answer that."" (Also, and this was just a byproduct of working at a company where the devs are a cost center and most of them don't gaf about coding, a lack of intellectual curiosity, so ""I don't know that and I don't need to know that, why are you asking that?"") I found myself more and more reluctant to ask for guidance and that contributed to a vicious cycle / negative feedback loop terminating in learned helplessness. At the end, I would just spin my wheels doing more or less nothing and work on my own coding stuff / learn skills on the job.Second biggest was probably not working as a team. Like the OP mentions, my team also all pretty much did their own thing. There wasn't even an attempt at a crude version of scrum, let alone daily team communication or standups. Everybody did their own thing in a silo. This was worsened by both the previous red flag mentioned and by the fact that promotions and titles were very much a political game. So, ""sure, my team might be suffering overall because X and Y are having trouble on their project, but it's not *my* problem.""Third is more mundane, but basically a strange combination of moving slow and breaking things—""we've always done it this way"" + ""whatever works don't worry about the technical debt."" No version control, no CI/CD, no test suites, no QA, a deploy process that had to be scheduled weeks in advance and that itself took a day, terrible documentation, and ""what's TDD/test coverage/etc."" What documentation there was took the form of technical specification documents which lol and that nobody read anyway.Anyway, I'm biased, but I really cannot recommend against working at Fidelity more*. Hope that helps re: red flags though!*(I haven't even gotten started on it taking almost 2 months just to get access to various systems or the hell that is on-call or the new grad ""training"" program or the offshore employees and contractors or)#I'm fairly positive it's Fidelity.#Sounds a lot like the Fidelity new grad program to me too#Same issue with this company on the Systems and Network Engineering side. Bunch of old guys that do things in ways that are so old and when we explain new modern ways of doing things they knock it down as being dumb or ineffective. They send us through a 7 week training program and then send us into our BU to have on the job training. However, the people you work with don't know how to teach you the proper way to do your job. Lots of outdated documents and processes. I've come in and done so much documentation and little technical work. Asking for help to understand what one should do seems like a burden on more senior team members that are senior and principal level people. We have had several of our  new grads leave already before their one year commitment is up. I've talked to several of my alumni from my class and they all have very similar horror stories about their experience here. "
Accounting;5vc1y0;1487690751.0;/r/Accounting/comments/5vc1y0/career_switch_advice/;Career Switch Advice;Hello my fellow accountants,   I have been hesitant to post this question because I think I know the answer but I have been in this community for awhile giving advice and taking advice so I thought it's probably the best place to ask. I can no longer stand the accounting career path I have taken and need to find my new path. Am I crazy?Alright so here is a bit about me (This is a throwaway to avoid linking it to my other one)* Graduated with a bachelor's in Accounting from a well-respected school * Worked for government my junior/senior year and 1 year after as a budget/project analyst * Decided to avoid the CPA exam (Didn't enjoy the Big 4 lifestyle) got my CMA and began working for a manufacturing company as a cost accountant* Began working as an FP&A analyst on the side for a non-profit (unpaid)* Wanted to live near a city and moved into a new cost accountant role in another industry and found myself doing the same work for slightly more pay, but with less to do.All in all, I have about 5-6 years of solid cost accounting experience and various FP&A work for a charity. However, I am not happy in this type of role and I am not really sure where to look to do the type of work I am both good at and an enjoy.The best parts of my day are when people ask real questions about numbers, forcing me to pull in big data, create cost models or dashboards in excel. In my current role, I have automated most of my work in VBA that I feel like I am a glorified data analyst with some accounting knowledge. So my real question is where do I go from here? What role can I move to that will let me use my excel, SQL, VBA, data warehouse skills to actually help out besides just making a pre-defined role more automated. I know a lot of people here are in busy season and will shun me for saying it but my job is boring and too easy. There is no challenge, we work 60 hours a week but most of it is me just being here so I am here not real work.In my mind, the roles I can move to are in the IT world now: Business Intelligence, Business Analyst...etc. However I haven't quite figured out how to open those doors and whether they will really be what challenges me to feel like my job is a job and not just sitting at a desk waiting.Any advice is greatly appreciated and I apologize for the wall of text so here is a TL DR-**Worked as a cost analyst/accountant for 5+ years, want to find a role that challenges my analytical side more.**;BI or BA roles aren't IT oriented in every manifestation. If that interests you go for it.I would avoid the IT oriented ones where you become s project manager or report monkey for other departments.#Sounds like you would like business analytics, and as far as I know each of the Big 4 are building out their capabilty in that area.I, also, would have suggested using a recruiter but you dont seem to fond of that idea. Other than that you could go the route of employee referrals which are generally processed faster than random applications. If you want, you can inbox me and we can talk the possibility of putting in a referral at my firm. EDIT: quick references - [KPMG](https://advisory.kpmg.us/managementconsulting/capabilities/article-analytics.html?gclid=COqzt_LWodICFTUz0wodhwQMEQ), [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/deloitte-analytics/solutions/deloitte-analytics.html), [PWC](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/analytics.html), [EY](http://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/advisory/ey-big-data-and-analytics)#actually i am very very curious on how to fall in the same role as you have, did you learn everything at work?! or are you selfthaugh at home?!  i dont have my CPA nor my CMA, and i dont want to work more than 40hours a week.  My work/life balance is very important to me !!  also i am a average student/learner my gpa is 2.8..I realize i dont really like accounting...there is no goal at all and i dont feel usefull at all... its like veryfing the work of someone else and msot of the time its already good and you jstu verified it for nothing... you could have had done nothing and it wouldnt had change the results...and i really like computers in general and i am curious and want to learn SQL, database, Excel, VBA and work with them !! the only time i like my day at work is when i create a new spreadsheet or when someone ask me to help them with a hard index/match or pivot table...but is there any entry level position into those role?!  what does the day of a cost accountant look like?!#remindme! 2 days#how old are you?!  are those role open to someone with 2.8 GPA?! with no CPA?! and no experience?!#You're right, you know the answer.>I haven't quite figured out how to open those doors Use a recruiter.#[deleted]#Yeah I was basically in that role at my manufacturing company just building models for everyone. Which was fine but I wasn't improving my skills just making their jobs slightly easier and more automated.#I wasn't aware the big 4 were diving too much into since it seems a lot of IT consulting firms have been taking the roles from what I have seen. Interesting to hear I do have quite a few friends from college working at Deloitte and KPMG. As nice as that sounds I fear the travel may not be approved by the wife since she is in the settle down mindset. However, I will look into it for sure and see what options their are. Thank you!#Well, my role fell into my lap after working on some government contracts and following a lead into a manufacturing company that needed a cost analyst to help with a new building project. If you read my post though this work wasn't ultimately what I wanted since it relied heavy on the day to day accounting work of maintaining simple worksheets or dealing with variances in the balance sheet. The actual work I enjoyed which sounds like you enjoy as well is what I am chasing. Analytics, using excel to solve problems and answer questions instead of just reporting what happened.Entry level: I have no idea but I imagine a BI developer or intern program exists somewhere that can get you started but can't really speak to it since I am not privy as to what is out there. Edit: To answer your first question about how I learned..books, practice, practice, more books. I love to read and that is how I have taught myself most of what I do now. You will find in most jobs that the people surrounding you will have varying skill levels in the software in front of them. In my experience, no one was savvy at excel except for a basic vlookup or sumif which is fine it got the job done. VBA I learned through trial and error and books, most of that was learned while in school building models and dashboards to work with MS Project. The SQL experience is hard to really learn without good data to pull from and play with but I personally thought SQL was one of the most new user-friendly language I have learned. That being said I was already established in a few other languages so I may not be a good example.#I will be messaging you on [**2017-02-23 18:12:45 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2017-02-23 18:12:45 UTC To Local Time) to remind you of [**this link.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5vc1y0/career_switch_advice/de125z7)[**CLICK THIS LINK**](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=[https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5vc1y0/career_switch_advice/de125z7]%0A%0ARemindMe!  2 days) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete Comment&message=Delete! de1295m)_____|[^(FAQs)](http://np.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/24duzp/remindmebot_info/)|[^(Custom)](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=[LINK INSIDE SQUARE BRACKETS else default to FAQs]%0A%0ANOTE: Don't forget to add the time options after the command.%0A%0ARemindMe!)|[^(Your Reminders)](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List Of Reminders&message=MyReminders!)|[^(Feedback)](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBotWrangler&subject=Feedback)|[^(Code)](https://github.com/SIlver--/remindmebot-reddit)|[^(Browser Extensions)](https://np.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/4kldad/remindmebot_extensions/)|-|-|-|-|-|-|#The unfortunate answer...bad experience with recruiters thus far but I am still young so it may be worth trying again. #I did not want to do audit, tax, or assurance...so the CPA had no career path that interested me. CMA is way heavier on the cost and analytics side so it was more logical for me. No reason to bash me for my decisions, I did what I thought I would like and succeed the best at.#thats my dream job... what kind of role do i need to apply to be the guy that will automate most of the admin staff tasks?!#> I fear the travel may not be approved by the wifeThis is something that ranges not only from industry to industry but also from project to project. And I would assume that it is definitely something that you could work with a firm to avoid. One nearly sure fire way: you could recruit into a Federal practice. Federal contracts rarely write in very much money for travel budgets and most of th Big 4 are focusing on growing their Federal practices. Deloitte's consulting and advisory Federal practice is by far the largest and most established, while EY and PWC are still relatively in the growth stage. I know for certain that PWC is moving away from the Federal audit space to clear the way for a perspective advisory/consulting practice. I don't have too much info on KPMG's Federal advisory/consulting practice, but I couldn't imagine it being too large as they still play around in the Federal audit space#Deloitte also has an audit analytics group that specifically works for our audit teams in order to build models and dashboards in order to support our testing efforts. They don't travel at all.#> bad experience with recruiters thusIt sounds like you're not communicating or being specific enough. You barely know the role you want but you need to hash it out by actually talking to someone who knows the IT MIS/DBA side of it.#I did it as a cost analyst at a manufacturing company. Really all that happened is they learned that I was pretty savvy with excel/vba/sql so I was automating reports, expediting P&L reporting and basically removing manual and menial tasks from most of the staff accountant jobs. Now that I am gone I am sure if anything breaks they will go back to manually keying numbers and linking 500 spreadsheets together. So easiest way is to get very very good with excel (And not formulas, but modeling, dashboards, basically programming in excel)#That is helpful and I agree on it differing, project to project. My first few years were working with the Navy and I only traveled 5 days out of the month and then almost every week once we moved to the next project (About when I moved on).I will have to ping some of my contacts at the Big 4 and see what roles are around. My other concern is certifications or furthering education. I have held off going back to get my Masters since I felt a career change would be in my path at some point which I know can help push me in a new direction.On top of all that the only other barrier I have really thought of is location, which was key at my last job where I was able to work almost 100% remote with office visits for meetings and such. Any idea if this is common in the BI world? My thoughts are that it will differ from firm to firm but probably isn't o uncommon given a lot of the work can be done away from a client.#Very interesting, do you know if they are mainly IT experienced or a mixed bag? I have had a few encounters with analytics groups and they tend to be IT type folk who are less into the business knowledge and are just able to help work data to the clients need.#Honestly, this was unrelated to this current job move it was when I was trying to move out of manufacturing. The few I worked with were being a tad shady and car salesmen like and the few phone interviews I had I could tell they lied about my experience. Since this is unrelated to that I am sure to look into recruiters since they will have a better lay of the land then I do.#any ressources to learn those Excel, SQL, VBA skills?!  (usually when i read a book i prefer fantastic or medieval... i dont see myself reading Excel for fun#> My other concern is certifications or furthering educationFurthering education may be less of a concern since your experience speaks to your ability to perform the work and your degree is relevant. Certs would definitely be something you would be expected to get before being able to reach manager though. Not sure of the leading certs in business analytics but you might want to start looking at that if this is a path you want. Or ask preferred certs during an interview> able to work almost 100% remote with office visits for meetings and suchFrom what I have seen (anecdotal so take with a grain of salt), this can basically go right out the window for Big 4 lol. Again varies from firm to firm and project to project though. At least in the scope of Federal work, you *may* luck up on a project that allows remote work on the civilian side of the house but anything requiring a clearance is 99.8% of the time require work to be done at client site#PM me so I can be a little more specific. #>  the few phone interviews I had I could tell they lied about my experience. Uh to get you the interview absolutely they'll fluff your resume and so should you. It's standard practice to plump it up (not to lie).#I can't remember the name of the VBA book but it was geared towards MSProject VBA but had a blend of excel it taught me a ton of tidbits that I was able to use to learn some more advanced techniques (Like I said trial and error). As for Excel most of it has been because I have been using excel now for almost 8 years in some sort of work setting and the other part is from using the Mrexcel forums to answer and learn from other users. Excel is an amazing tool but you can't learn all the tricks without helping or learning from others. Dashboards and modeling just came from time, and learning different consumers needs...what an engineer wants is going to be way different than what a controller wants. SQL I think there is a free course on codeacademy? Might be a good start otherwise I didn't use SQL till I hit a manufacturing company that used it, but a lot of companies rely on SAP/Oralce type systems and SQL becomes more of an IT function. Although in my current role I assist with verify data with SQL but don't get to do a ton of automated reports with it.#Agreed on the federal work although all of what I did was under TS clearance yet the actual work was done outside of clearance which allowed some remote work (Mostly airports). I wonder how much working for the Big 4 with a federal client will match my government experience because that was rather slow paced and the types I worked with (Engineers) did not care for my models, dashboards. They were more inclined to want to see how much budget % was used/available. #I was young and fresh out of college I just thought they were lying to get themselves paid I will admit. I have been hesitant ever since.Will have to give them another chance. Thanks for the incite. #maybe i am thinking of going more toward an IT role than an accounting once, does it require an other degree or an acocunting degree is fine?!  Learning Oracle, SQL and automating and creating tools for admin users sound really exciting and fun!!  (even if i dont know any programming so far)  do you think its something i canlearn on the job??! or transition into?!)#> I wonder how much working for the Big 4 with a federal client will match my government experienceHate to be super repetitive here but thats honest to God gonna vary project to project lmao. My Fed projects have never demanded more than 50hr/wk and have a steady avg of 45/wk. On the flip side, I have two colleagues who immediately come to mind that have regular 60+hr weeks (one on a civ agency, one intel).As far as the battle of egos is concerned, that is most definitely going to remain a part of your experience haha! If consulting has taught me anything, its to offer your client what you beleive is best but when they ask specifically for something different just give them what they ask for. Be sure to CYA (cover your ass) via paper trails (email) and always CC the right people so that blame cant be shifted to you after the fact!And I totally forgot earlier that you said you've already got a cert in the CMA. Your exp both topically and industry-wise having worked in the Fed before, I know for a fact my practice would eat you up!#No problem and I think you're a bit confused on who pays them... You don't pay a recruiter (or rather... you never should) your future employer foots the bill.#Learn on the job sure...you could always look into it I really don't know that much about the hiring process on these things. Learning SQL and Oracle is usually on-job training and are in my opinion fairly easy software to use once you have played around for a few weeks. Reach out to recruiter as suggested by another user.#Haha, I appreciate the sentiment, unfortunately, I am not trying to jump back into federal work quite yet. This career change will hopefully be over the next year as I refine my skills and look into any certs that may help. I will keep you in mind though because it seems like the Big 4 may be moving in a direction that interests me more.The other piece of the puzzle is my wife's career is rather static so it would be a dual move and she is in a medical field so its a whole nother ball game matching up our career locations. #Oh no that's what I was implying, I am saying it is in their best interests to get me interviews and into a role to get paid. Therefore the cars salesman technique works. I would never pay for a recruiter. :) #are those kind of job kinda laid back?! or really stressfull?!#It's similar to realtors. Time is money and often the first job is the best if you have nothing currently.#May seem like a dumb question but how does one even find a recruiter nowadays? My first encounter was from a job posting that didn't come to fruition and then the recruiter kept looking for me. Since its a new role I imagine recruiters have their specialities, but is it as simple as job hunting just searching for a recruiter instead of a role?#Do you have a LinkedIn? I'd get messages just about every other week.

SQLServer;5y8k5v;1488987386.0;/r/SQLServer/comments/5y8k5v/what_should_i_learn_now_career_advice_for_sql/;What should I learn now?( career advice for SQL developer);Hey guys,I have been working in IT industry for 5 years now and for the most part as SQL server developer with BI tools like SSIS,SSRS and SSAS.I want to expand my skillset and learn something new which would help my career. However, I'm not sure what technology to go with as there are so many to choose from and I am not that wise to see what would be future proof. From what I have researched, people are jumping into Big data and starting to learn HIVE, Hbase so that they dont have to jump into Java for hadoop . I'm still confused tho if this would be a right approach to start learning Big data technology.Any help would be appreciated.Thanks;If you want to stay in the SQL Server world and expand your knowledge I would suggest looking at R/PolyBase in SQL Server 2016.  Even though R is slow is does let you query structured and unstructured data.And don't forget trying to add some experience with Azure and Azure Data Warehouse.  And do you do any Power BI development?Edit: spelling#I don't know if you are familiar with this podcast. The host interviewed the CTO of Microsoft about the future of data management.... I don't have any answers, but you might find this enlightening:https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2017/big-data-tools-and-trends#How much business acumen do you have?#SQL developer you say? Maybe one of the humanities. Jokes.Big data is not going away. You can train with learning data sets and a few VM's. HIVE seems to have a future though. Several universities are teaching it now. I would begin by just following tutorials on the HIVE site for setting up a small cluster of VM's. Then understand the director and clusters, then move on to one of the books that come recommended on a site like amazon.#SQL Server has added a lot of big data support recently. If you aren't already, get familiar with columnstore indexes. These will give you the functionality of HBase, but in an ecosystem you're already familiar with. http://www.nikoport.com/columnstore/ is the best resource I've seen on them. I'd also learn R as someone else suggested. I haven't seen it in action, but being able to do advanced data analysis within SQL Server will be huge.Also work on performance tuning. If you can't read a query plan, learn. If you aren't in the habit of tuning every large query you run, get in the habit. There are real purposes for distributed processing, but most companies don't actually need it. If you can partition a table with a clustered columnstore index, you can store a lot of data with excellent query performance, which will save your company a lot of money and you a lot of time debugging issues with distributed systems.#I am hearing a lot about R also, but NoSQL is another route to go. Learn CouchDB or the like. #This is the correct answer,  i believe.  Sql server 2016 can turn your R program into a map reduce program running on your Hadoop cluster. #I will definitely check out the R/ polybase in 2016. And have some knowledge in power bi but not so in azure. Even in one of the interviews ,I was asked about azure development but I only had Little idea about it. Thanks for the info, will sure check it out.#[deleted]#Hey thanks. Let me check it out.#Not so much. My friend also suggested to jump into Business analyst with technical skills role and I be in business position in coming years if I would like that route.#Thanks. I started done tutorials on Hive but lost interest a while ago. Looks like have to force myself now. But from what others have said, learning polybase/R and azure would best suit me for now. #Thank you and I have done some performance tuning before and have some knowledge abt it but not too deep tho. But will check or column store indexes and learning R looks like the way from here too. Thanks for your input.#Had no idea. Will research on it.

Limite AI is the Business Intelligence of the future.There is a pretty good class on Machine Learning at EdX...https://www.edx.org/course/principles-machine-learning-microsoft-dat203-2x-2Browse the courses there...there are some good Azure and Big Data, Hadoop (HDInsight in the Azure world) and others.  Great resource.Best of luck!#Data scientist comes to mind, but SQL Developer still works.#I just spent the last 5 hours trying to understand why my line orders kept giving me foreign key errors and finally realized that I need to create an order key first before I can add line items with an order key. Right makes sense now of course. How you guys don't destroy several desktops a week by throwing them for irrational illogical circles SQL drives a person into is a huge mystery to me and I consider myself a very patient man. I would consider sacrificing a small animal to finish this work I'm doing if it would help. #Performance tuning, IMO, is how you separate yourself from the pack. Being able to move to a new company and immediately improve performance on everything you touch by tweaking some joins or doing proper index maintenance makes it obvious how necessary you are.#Hahha.

MBA;5z8cbf;1489445029.0;/r/MBA/comments/5z8cbf/profile_review_1st_individual_in_my_family_to/;Profile Review: 1st individual in my family to have attended college;*Background:*I'll start off by saying I originally thought of going to B-School locally in New Orleans to try and get out of the service industry and move more into Marketing/General management, which I'm interested in. I studied with Magoosh for 3 months, took the GMAT, and received a much better score than I expected. This caused me to shift my attention towards better schools but I don't really have the trajectory or background of most applicants. I'm trying to find out how to best focus my energy and what I should shoot for realistically. Besides my GMAT score, my only other real playing chip is that no one in my family, cousins and everyone included, has gone to college except for me and my younger sister, who is now attending undergrad. Other info is as follows.**Work experience**: Varied but has been pretty consistent since I was 15. Worked at a Sandwich/Ice Cream spot ages 15-17 during high school, then was a full time college student and worked at an Ace Hardware retail store for a year and 4 months. I then got a job working in the maintenance department of my university and moved into a quasi-project management role, which I held for 2 years. My following work experience is best detailed here:http://imgur.com/a/l84Mz**Extra Curricular**:Not much to put here unfortunately but I'm currently looking into volunteer opportunities. I'm a photographer and drummer by hobby and have been involved in both for about 10 years. I have a photo portfolio up at tylercorrea.com**Undergrad School/Major**:University of California, Santa CruzBA Sociology**Race/Nationality/Sex**:White/American/Male Age 25*Stats*:**Gmat Score**:740IR=7Q=48V=42Undergrad GPA= 3.52**Goal**:To switch out of my current industry and move into a management role at a more reputable company. I would then like to use experience gained through post-MBA employment to most likely start a small company with some other individuals. Of the available MBA concentrations I'm most interested in Marketing and more specifically big data/market research analysis. I've only read books on the subject and I'm currently in the process of certifying myself in Google Adwords, Google Analytics and Facebook Ads.My Target schools at the moment are UT McCombs, NYU Stern, UCLA Anderson, and Kellog Northwestern(biggest reach).Where do I go from here?I'd like to preemptively thank anyone who has taken a look at this, I've read many reviews in the past and find this subreddit to be an incredible resource. ;Hard stats = good. Work experience = terrible. Your work experience before and during college do not matter and it seems like your experience up to now has  been managing a restaurant. I think you'd be hard pressed getting an admittance to your target schools/reach. I'd apply to schools ranked 20-30 and if you want, maybe 2-3 reaches above that. You might need to work with a consultant to get your story straight. #[deleted]#You need two years of better experience. Consider something like the Peace Corps. Alternatively look into programs like Accounting/Finance masters which don't require prior experience. With your GMAT+GPA combo you'd be competitive for virtually all US MSF and accounting programs. #What did you use to study to get a 740?#I can see a possible top 20 but 20-30 seem more like your matches. I'm not sure how adcoms will view your WE but for me, it looks pretty weak. No EC's is no help either.Your stats are good but your story is kind of unclear. Were you originally from NO? If so, why did you attend a UC as an out of state student and pay private school level tuition? And then go back to NO just to become a restaurant manager? These are questions that will pop up in the adcom's minds and you should try to come up with a clear story.I think McCombs, Stern, and Anderson can be reach schools you apply to but definitely look into more 20-35 schools that are good regionally in areas where you are okay with living in. If you really want to apply to Kellogg, go ahead. I would choose 1 dream school, 2-3 reaches, 3 matches, and possibly one safety. With your stats, one school is bound to accept you.#When did you graduate from UCSC?#2 years at any type of marketing job will do OP wonders. #I used Magoosh.com. They have a math-centric three month study program and I spent 3 months grinding by myself following their guide. If you're a self-starter I would highly recommend it. Took the test cold and got a 560 or something and then got it up to the 740 after a few months.#June 2013#[deleted]#No verbal studying?#Word I think leveraging his high GMAT score and 1st gen college status could let him do something like TFA or tutoring that could help craft a story.#[deleted]#I did all of the verbal practice problems but almost none of the lessons. With math I went through every lesson video twice, even the most basic. Finished every practice problem available for all types and took 6 total practice tests and after that took the official one. About 13 weeks from opening the first book to taking the test.#Tempted to do Manhattan prep class but not sure if I should do live or the online course#have you taken a practice test yet? What are your strengths/weaknesses for Verbal/Quant?#I did online course (the live one) and magoosh on the side.  Magoosh is a waaaay better value but the online course helped me stay focused - especially if you actually do the assignments they ask you to.  #They were both fairly equal, so percentile wise my verbal is better#[deleted]#Which did you use? Background? Score?#[deleted]#Is there a calendar or excel version of the lesson plan schedule that isn't the long scrolling one on their site?

While I know some are more experienced than I, I thought I'd take a moment to share what I've learned with the reddit community.Here's a process that I found worked for me:**Optional, but highly recommended - Start a blog**You will begin to see what things are like as a writer, and as someone who pitches to you. Using my blog has helped me to see what pitches worked well, and what pitches did not work well. This is just based on my personal experience, but I think journalists connect better with bloggers because they are fellow writers.Now then, on to the rest of the process.**1. Brainstorm the media outlets you want to be on.**Not all PR will create the same effect for your business. Believe it or not, sites like Entrepreneur, Inc., and Forbes are great for social proof (thus increasing future sales), and SEO, but not often great at immediate sales.If you want fast sales, I would recommend finding PR sites or large blogs closely tailored to your niche. Not only have I and many entrepreneurs I know have found this to be true, but Jason Feifer (editor-in-chief of Entrepreneur) recently stated this in an article in this month's Entrepreneur magazine (he provides some great insight on how to land press from the other side of the table. It's worth checking out, if you can get your hands on a copy).As a marketer, [writing on Sumo](https://sumo.com/stories/influencer-marketing-super-connector) (formerly SumoMe) has provided more leads than any other coverage I've received. This article also led to me being mentioned on [SalesForce](https://www.salesforce.com/ca/blog/2016/06/establish-relationships-with-influencers.html), [Copyblogger](http://www.copyblogger.com/evergreen-content/), and [featured on Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sherry-gray/influencer-marketing-in-a_b_9422550.html). (Again, this is why it's easier to have a blog).**2. Come up with PR relevant topics** If you notice from the places I got press, there are different ways you can share your story and be relevant to different journalists. For example, the Entrepreneur piece is geared towards those who want to start a side hustle. The Inc. article is geared towards someone who writes, or has a blog. The Forbes article touches on the work-life balance.What I did not do, was try to get PR specifically about my business, but shared valuable information that would allow me to talk about it. That's not to say that you can't get PR about your product, but it has to have a story worth telling.To find relevant journalists, brainstorm a few broad topics to talk about. For example, my friend Allen Walton runs [Spy Guy Security](https://spyguysecurity.com). An obvious topic he could discuss is on spyware. A less obvious topic is how to find out if your spouse is cheating on you. As a 7-figure solopreneur, there's another angle (which got him [coverage on Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2015/05/30/how-bold-entrepreneurs-are-breaking-1-million-in-one-person-businesses/#b41d2b51ec12)). He's also shared from his experience on [how to deal with a PR nightmare](http://www.inc.com/cheryl-snapp-conner/think-your-days-gone-poorly-consider-this-founders-pr-nightmare.html).The more ideas you come up with, the more opportunities are at your finger tips.**3.  Find the relevant journalists**You know the media outlets you want to be on, and the topics you can discuss. Please, do not spam every writer on that publication. Not only will your pitch fall flat, you'll be promptly ignored by everyone in their organization, and many others.Different journalists write about different topics. A journalist who writes about franchises could care less about your drop shipping business.So, how do you find the relevant journalists to reach out to?I like to use Buzzsumo, add in the site, and start plugging in a few keywords I found in the previous step ([here's an example](https://app.buzzsumo.com/research/most-shared?type=articles&result_type=total&num_days=365&general_article&infographic&video&guest_post&giveaway&interview&q=forbes.com%20big%20data&page=1)).Looks like Bernard Marr, Louis Columbus, and Gil Press are three big data writers for Forbes.**4. Properly pitch journalists.**It's almost time to get that coveted press you have been hoping for! There's a lot when it comes to pitching journalists, but here are some quick steps:* Find their email address. Here are [4 ways I've used to find almost anyone's email address](http://www.thestorytellermarketer.com/influencer-marketing-guide/#email-discovery).* Use a short, but descriptive subject line why you are emailing them. Even using “Quick question NAME” has worked well for me. But if I'm saying it will be a quick question, my email better not be more than two lines.* Create a concise email, describring why you are relevant, and ending with a question. Why end with a question? Because this opens up a dialogue.* Follow up at least once. A simple, “Hey NAME, Just wanted to send you a quick note to see if you caught my last message.”I have used this formula to get response rates between 40-60% (which is higher than most marketers get for *open* rates).If you want more information, here's some recommended reading:* [Blogger Outreach Tips: How To Write Outreach Emails That Don’t Suck](http://www.bloggingwizard.com/effective-blogger-outreach/)* [The Ultimate Guide to Influencer Marketing](https://sumo.com/stories/influencer-marketing-super-connector)* [6 Creative Ways To Use Email Outreach To Grow Your Startup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCoUXOve-eQ) **5. Get press, or die trying.**Once you get a response back, either you will get a yes, a no, or some kind of clarification from them.Don't get discouraged if the answer is a no. If you keep building the relationship, another opportunity may follow. I had a relationship with Nathan Resnick for a year-and-a-half before pitching my idea for the Entrepreneur article. He gladly accepted it when I did.I pitched 20 relevant journalists on my article on [the ROI and psychology of clothes](http://blog.cofounderswithclass.com/dress-for-success/). Of those, I connected really well with one of them. A month later, she had a totally different idea, which she wrote for Inc.The Forbes piece was serendipitous. The author read an article on Zirtual, which I was interviewed for, and decided to use my quote. Although you can't expect this kind of result, eventually this will happen. In this situation, I found his email, said thanks, and began a relationship with him. **This is the easiest way to keep getting press.**There's more to the art and science of PR, but I thought this would be a good starting point to whet your appetite.Anything else I can help with or did not fully answer? Feel free to ask me anything!;"""What I did not do, was try to get PR specifically about my business,"" Great post Jason! And a good point too. You should highlight this as I think it's where so many people miss the mark.#By any chance it know how to find more media outlets especially those that are in a smaller niche?Great post by the way!#Congrats!How much time do you now invest in writing?#Thank you for this!

Big data; specific goals; well defined questions.... What else?";I work for an insurance company and I am planning on approaching upper management to promote the use for AI / Machine Learning / Deep Learning for specific functions such as pricing the insurance, minimizing losses and fraud detection.  I work with data in IT, but I have never touched AI before.One of the things I want management to understand is that Deep Learning is only useful in certain conditions, it is perfect some things, and not so great for others.  So when is Deep Learning most useful? What are the ideal conditions for a Machine Learning / Deep Learning project to be successful?  Here's what I have so far:AI/deep learning is ideal when:* You have a lot of data, structured or unstructured* You are trying to do something very specific goal - Well defined questions* You can train it based on desired outcomes* What else?I have googled this about 30 different ways now, and have failed to come up with a good list.Thanks for your help!!;"If you want the best chance for success you need to approach it completely different to the way you're thinking. First look at what is costing the business the most amount of money (ie. Fraudulent claims cost our business $150 M per annum). I'm sure you can find about 5 different scenarios/examples.Then paint the picture of how the information you already capture can be leveraged to lead to a reduction in this cost. Find reference material and research papers which demonstrate such applications of DL.Then, based on your data science expertise, work out what the likely saving would be from an implementation of DL that will result in (let's say) 20% of cases. Keep it high level, they are managers and therefore don't have time for detail. Then propose a POC based on and x% utilisation of your time and others if necessrry focusing on DL use case for one domain. Go for it#It depends a lot on the questions you have to answer and the data you're working with.But my advice would be to look over some basic machine learning/statistics which could help you know when to use, say classification to predict fraud or a regression to learn more about loss or something.Basically, there are a lot of useful techniques out there besides deep learning (not that deep learning isn't useful, it's just very ""in"" right now), but it's hard to have a general guideline for when machine learning can be helpful. Or maybe I'm just blanking on what some general guidelines would be edit: I'd recommend [this](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) book if you feel you have the math background for it#For a machine learning project to be successful, you need to have a goal in mind. Dont hire a data scientist just because everyone else is - you need a question, or range of questions, that they can answer.You need at least some idea of some data that might go to support this - it doesn t have to be everything, but if you dont have any data that supports this, it is already a disaster.Do NOT run the early stage of this as a traditional IT project. You can't break it into sprints and apply a typical agile methodology to it. A lot of the start is going to be very much about R&D. Once you start to show some progress, THEN you can go to an Agile approach.Another thing is having a data scientist who is good at communicating with your stakeholders. A good way to do it is to ask them to explain a neural network to you - see how they approach that, and if you're engaged by the answer at all.#Nothing works until it actually works in Deep Learning.#Most ML is still not deep learning.Some extra things to consider:Do you have to beat something that's already highly optimized (market prices, human grandmaster) or is any improvement valuable?Will humans be trying to game your system? They can probably adapt faster than you can and they'll find flaws.Are machine generated results acceptable? Minimizing a cost function doesn't always make customers happy if the errors are unnatural.Do you need comprehensible predictions you can justify in court?#A critical bit people miss is that there must be some signal in the data. A good indication of this is a history of success with feature engineering, heuristics, and intuition. If the problem is important enough, humans are awfully good at getting getting close to the bayes optimal classifier in any particular problem. This may not always be true - but its a good approximation.There's a somewhat plausible, but imo wrong, belief out there that computers can detect patterns in data humans cannot. But I've not found a single example where this is true - at least not in a field which is important enough to merit human analysis. I'd be happy to be proven wrong.#Deep learning has been successful with machine translation (translating text), image recognition, speech recognition, speech generation, and a few other assorted ""party tricks"" (which, admittedly, are very cool!). There is no AI with common sense or reasoning and there won't be any time soon.#You're being down-voted, but it's true. It's difficult to determine if an ML technique will work without trying it. Do you have a team or ability to put a team together? That's obviously the most important part.#I beg to differ. Look at finance, trading or any place with very high dimensional data (excluding natural images) optimizing things jointly etc...#I dont agree either. I mean you're fundamentally right that all these things are doing is implementing statistics in one way or another, but you can end up with some really subtle, diverse, or high-order relationships between data that a human has no change in hell of spotting for themselves. #Biotech is another example.  My understanding is that ML has been successful at things like drug discovery because it's good at finding signals that humans miss.#do you have some good examples from the literature where this is the case?"

Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Where does it end? The article discusses advances in artificial intelligence, its use by corporations and government, and the resulting decline in freedom. Some examples: China is using algorithms to develop a 'Citizen Score' which will allow the government to easily decide who gets privileges such as loans and the right to travel. This sort of thing is also coming to the West. The digital revolution isn't all an intentionally malicious move towards Orwellian control of the populace - in some cases governments and corporations are attempting to help citizens make better life choices - but in the end, it will all result in a decline in freedom unless limits are placed on the use of this technology.

wallstreetbets;5x19wz;1488430186.0;/r/wallstreetbets/comments/5x19wz/shale_20_why_oil_will_stay_below_60barrel_for_the/;Shale 2.0: Why oil will stay below $60/barrel for the foreseeable future;https://www.manhattan-institute.org/pdf/eper_16.pdfTL DR Here’s the executive summary of Mark Mills' excellent paper describing the massive changes big data and technology have brought to the petroleum extraction industry:  With petroleum prices down 50 percent over the past year, many analysts and pundits are predicting the end of America’s shale oil boom. Recent headlines include: “Oil Price Fall Forces North Dakota to Consider Austerity” (New York Times) “Oil Price Drop Hurts Spending on Business Investments” (Wall Street Journal)  “The American Oil Boom Won’t Last Long at $65 per Barrel”(Bloomberg Business)  and “The Shale Oil Revolution Is in Danger” (Fortune).High prices, shale skeptics argue, created a bubble of activity in unsustainably expensive shale fields. As shale-related businesses contract, consolidate, and adjust to the new price regime, a major shale bust is inevitable, they add, with ghost towns littering idle fields from Texas to North Dakota.  It is true that the oil-price collapse was caused by the astonishing, unexpected growth in U.S. shale output, responsible for three-fourths of new global oil supply since 2008. And as lower prices roil operators and investors, the shale skeptics’ case may seem vindicated. But their history is false: the shale revolution, “Shale 1.0,” was sparked not by high prices—it began when prices were at today’s low levels—but by the invention of new technologies. Now, the skeptics’ forecasts are likely to be as flawed as their history. This paper explains how continued technological progress, particularly in big-data analytics, has the U.S. shale industry poised for another, longer boom, a “Shale 2.0.”The End of the BeginningJohn Shaw, chair of Harvard’s Earth and Planetary Sciences Department, recently observed: “It’s fair to say we’re not at the end of this [shale] era, we’re at the very beginning.”  He is precisely correct. In recent years, the technology deployed in America’s shale fields has advanced more rapidly than in any other segment of the energy industry. Shale 2.0 promises to ultimately yield break-even costs of $5–$20 per barrel—in the same range as Saudi Arabia’s vaunted low-cost fields.The shale industry is unlike any other conventional hydrocarbon or alternative energy sector, in that it shares a growth trajectory far more similar to that of Silicon Valley’s tech firms. In less than a decade, U.S. shale oil revenues have soared, from nearly zero to more than $70 billion annually (even after accounting for the recent price plunge). Such growth is 600 percent greater than that experienced by America’s heavily subsidized solar industry over the same period.  Shale’s spectacular rise is also generating massive quantities of data: the $600 billion in U.S. shale infrastructure investments and the nearly 2,000 million well-feet drilled have produced hundreds of petabytes of relevant data. This vast, diverse shale data domain—comparable in scale with the global digital health care data domain—remains largely untapped and is ripe to be mined by emerging big-data analytics.Shale 2.0 will thus be data-driven. It will be centered in the United States. And it will be one in which entrepreneurs, especially those skilled in analytics, will create vast wealth and further disrupt oil geopolitics. The transition to Shale 2.0 will take the following steps:1. Oil from Shale 1.0 will be sold from the oversupply currently filling up storage tanks.2. More oil will be unleashed from the surplus of shale wells already drilled but not in production.3. Companies will “high-grade” shale assets, replacing older techniques with the newest, most productive technologies in the richest parts of the fields.4.As the shale industry begins to embrace big-data analytics, Shale 2.0 begins.Further, if the U.S. is to fully reap the economic and geopolitical benefits of Shale 2.0, Congress and the administration should:1. Remove the old, no longer relevant, rules prohibiting American companies from selling crude oil overseas.2. Remove constraints, established by the 1920 Merchant Marine Act, on transporting domestic hydrocarbons by ship.3. Avoid inflicting further regulatory hurdles on an already heavily regulated industry.4. Open up and accelerate access to exploration and production on federally controlled lands.TL DR TL DR	The price of shale oil will continue to decrease bigly due to big data.  Barring a major geopolitical shift or fuckup, oil will likely not go back above 60/barrel for the forseeable future.  Go long petroleum companies, fuck Tesla.  If CHK doesn’t fucking collapse under debt they could see big returns from fracking in the next decade.

The first step of my project was downloading the entire blockchain and transforming it from a sequence of binary files to a friendlier, more useful text format using Hadoop MapReduce.Now that I have this data, I'm having trouble coming up with something to do with it. I've read previous papers (Traveling the silk road, de-anonymizing users from transactions, etc...). Does anyone have any ideas of what I can use the data for? For instance, what cool things can I visualize with it? Maybe I can compare it with other currencies of the world to prove some point? Maybe analyze transaction volume to predict future transaction volume, etc... I'm relatively new to bitcoin so it's hard for me to think of something feasible and useful. Any ideas? Thank you.;"Try to confuse the other data miners as much as you can.#Plot the relationship between transaction size, fee paid, and transaction time. I think we would all like to see how these trends change over time and how tech/political change affects it. #I would like to see an in depth analysis of all non traditional transactions, like P2SH.

I don't think anyone is including mempool (unconfirmed) transactions.  That would be like an ""early warning"" indicator.One might be able to predict price moves on the exchanges by analyzing moves (of older coins) on the blockchain.This used to be something where there was a correlation ... years ago.  Big dumps at the exchanges were preceded by big transfers of old coins (as deposits to the exchanges).  Then it was so easily faked that I don't know many traders that still employed that strategy.    But now with blocks being full and fees being high, there is probably not much ""fake"" activity and instead, Bitcoin Days Destroyed might again be an interesting signal.  And including mempool activity gets rid of the lag before a confirmation occurs, adding value to the metric.       But watch for attempts to fake out your BDD from those spending old coins but with a fee to low that it never confirms.   You might also try to exclude from the BDD transactions from exchanges.  That's harder to detect but maybe ChainAnalysis' work might provide a way you can figure out which are from exchanges.#Not sure if you're joking or not. If not, can you elaborate on this?#To do that requires mempool transaction logging as well, and not just the extract of blockchain transaction data.There's probably dozens of approaches to doing that.

MBA;5wfe5w;1488179483.0;/r/MBA/comments/5wfe5w/mba_programs_starting_to_emphasize_coding/;MBA Programs Starting to Emphasize Coding;Companies want to hire technically skilled MBAs, and business schools are finally starting to get it. MBA programs equip students with management techniques, accounting skills and, increasingly, entrepreneurship chops. Some top programs, however, believe MBAs should learn to code.Harvard Business School is planning to offer a computer programming elective within a couple of years, says Paul Gompers, who chairs the MBA elective curriculum. Students have formed coding clubs, and dozens go “across the river” to take the introductory computer science class at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. But professors need to tailor a course specifically to business students in Boston, says Gompers.“This is the changing nature of the workforce, and this is what our graduates are going on to be doing in the next five to 10 to 20 years.”Elite MBA programs have been slow to adapt, even though plenty of schools started specialized master’s programs in big data and analytics. A pair of springtime reports by the Graduate Management Admission Council revealed a disconnect between the skills MBA programs give students and what employers want. While recent graduates said they learned the least about “technology, design, etc.” and “managing tools and technology” out of any other skills in B-schools, U.S. employers said they coveted “technical and quantitative skills” third out of 10 criteria.“We’ve got a lot of MBAs graduating and going off to be high-tech product managers. If you look at that world, there are a bunch of big tech companies that insist that anyone in that role be technical — understand code well enough to read it and write it,” says Thomas Eisenmann, an HBS professor who teaches a course on product management.Companies don’t want an army of programmers from B-schools — they can recruit from computer science programs for that — but they need managers who know the basics of code to work with technical staff. To be a product manager at Amazon, for instance, MBAs need to “dive into data and be technically conversant,” says Miriam Park, director of university programs at the company.At New York University’s Stern School of Business, economics professor David Backus plans to start a course that will teach students how to visualize data and use the programming language, Python. “I’ve talked to people I know at other B-schools, and they haven’t heard of anything really like this. It’s surprising,” he says.Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, a B-school with a reputation as a tech powerhouse, has no coding classes. Students have been able to take computer science courses at the university since fall 2012  Madhav Rajan, the business school’s senior associate dean for academic affairs, says this obviates the need for a focus on coding. Last year, the B-school and the School of Engineering launched a joint degree that confers an MBA and an MS in computer science.One downside of learning to code at B-school: Coding is hard. HBS students who took the university’s introductory computer science course said that they spent 16.3 hours a week on the course, which is “2-3 [times] more time than they would spend on an MBA elective that yielded equivalent academic credit,” wrote Eisenmann in a Harvard Business Review blog post last fall.Backus says schools should make coding electives available but avoid requiring them so that MBAs don’t feel burdened. “Students could get annoyed at you and think it’s too hard.”;"Good for engineers like me who may be going to b school! Coding is ez!!#[deleted]#Totally sucks for me, a business grad. I guess before I start bschool I have to actually pick up proper coding/data analytics to the point I can communicate well. Ohhh the pros and the cons.#For the non-engineers, how much coding/CS knowledge will be enough? People spend their entire careers are engineers and it's impossible to compete with them.#I agree but they are helpful in the long run, and soon there's gonna be a portal dedicated to management students to help them sail smoothly thru' their assignments#Coding would be targetted to those students who would opt for systems as their specialisations #U welcome buddy :)#I always heard people say this, but I double majored in business and engineering for a couple years (dumb move, do one and then MIT LGO or Kellogg MMM) before finishing with just one. I felt like in my STEM classes, the kids bitched and moaned for hours about how hard they had to work compared to everyone else, but it felt like 10-20% more work at most. Further, the kids who got lower grades either a) didn't try hard enough but thought they did, because ""a C is like an A everywhere else"" or b) simply weren't the kids that would do well in any major#If I may suggest, I would start with Python  Python is very easy to learn, even for non cs-people, and you can use it in all situations due to the immense libraries that are available. Additionally, Python is used heavily in data analytics so if you're interested in working with large sets of data and making sense of it then Python is a requirement. I believe HackerRank.com has tutorials/exercises for Python so you can start there. #I think it's unnecessary to learn in an MBA program. If you know it, great! It'll help your career. But two semesters of C++ will not give you anything honestly. ""Hello World.""#That's awesome!!! Thank you so much for the suggestion. "

Generally speaking, we use python as an all purpose tool, which means we prefer using python as a single language to tackle everything as opposed to multiple languages and fighting the integrations. So where would I tell you to spend your time? Learn to use python on tools like databricks, apache zeppelin, or jupyter notebooks. Find a data set either through searching or to answer a question you have. Put your data in an AWS S3 bucket and use python to connect to it, cleanse and manipulate the data, and then plot it using an interactive library like plotly. Build a dashboard from the data set with descriptive and predictive statistics using geo, boxplots, and time series charts. Accomplishing this will teach you python, statistics, visualization tools, distributed computing, apache spark, working with arrays and likely linux if going the apache zeppelin route. If you set up apache zeppelin on AWS EMR, you could spin it up and show it off during interviews as well.I would follow that up with research into how python is used and integrated into production products at scale. At this point, learning the concepts and being able to speak intelligently about them will get your foot in the door. Rinse and repeat after that - good luck!#This might be helpful:https://www.edx.org/course/programming-python-data-science-microsoft-dat210x-2#There are also a lot of videos out there that cover python and data mining etc.#Thanks a lot all#Thanks a lot buddy..Great advice!!"

We currently schedule many tasks through MS SQL agent to hit teradata, ASTER, oracle, and vertica DBs through regular ETL processes for reporting etc. What i would like to know is.  Is there a fairly standard query that would identify tables, columns and possibly unique values for the entirety of a database?I know there are software programs out there that will map a database, and i know that there are queries that can be used to get the basics of a known table, but is there a query that can be used to discover new tables or columns in tables that could be run through an ETL process?Any Ideas?EDIT:  End result is output to a website.  Something that we could manually edit when new tables or columns would present themselves. we could do the research and add descriptions to the new columns, tables, or values.  also include pertinent join information etc. ;I may be misunderstand the question.  But does this help?    - SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES- SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS#No idea but this advanced of a question won't get much response here.

When you run the scripts you can identify new objects, add them to your metadata store and then with metadata logic decide if you want to build and deploy new ssis packages or whatever for handling. Takes some time to learn but will be very valuable as your project expands or runs for a long time.To check out if this is for you try the free versions and build your own metadata store or get a licence for BIML studio (there is also a free trial for something like 2 weeks): https://varigence.com/bimlstudio#You are on the right track.

labrats;5ws18h;1488330810.0;/r/labrats/comments/5ws18h/opinionsexperiences_with_statistical_analyses_for/;Opinions/experiences with statistical analyses for publications;So I'm a molecular biologist and I don't deal with big data, computational data, modelling etc.  As such my statistical analyses tend to be very basic - t-tests, chi-square tests etc. I tend to do all my statistical analyses using Graphpad Prism - I find the interface easy to use, very clear, and the graphing functions are great for publication.  However my colleague insists that I need to run all my data through a more complicated programme e.g. R, SAS, SPSS etc. to ensure that it is water tight before I can submit my paper.I'm interested in your opinions and experiences - as I haven't used any of these programmes myself, it seems a bit odd for him to insist that I learn them just to redo the stats I've already done.  I've been in research since 2006 and never had any issues until now, and never had any issues getting things to publication.  I'm certainly not going to lie and claim I've checked my very simple stats in a more complex programme just to satisfy my colleague so we can move forward to publication.  Thoughts? Any similar experiences?;It's perfectly fine to use graphpad prism for basic analysis. What matters more is understanding the tests you are performing and ensuring your data fits within the limits of it. If you don't want to learn R, it's still good to be more cognizant of your actual data analysis. For example, just using a histogram to eyeball the shape of your data before a t-test could save you from bad stats if your data is not normally distributed. #As /u/multi-mod pointed out, Graphpad Prism is absolutely fine to use. It is a statistical program designed and programmed for biology and their statistics is sound.It doesn't matter if you use Prism, SPSS or R, they all will give you the same results... It might be true that you can't do some specific, extravaganza tests, but in my experience, most often you don't need them. Just be sure what kind of data you have and what test is appropriate for your question... And that you don't break the premises for the tests... Graphpad provides very detailed manuals for all kinds of test and data requirements, so look them up and decide to your best knowledge...#I guess it depends on your field/data but I've never had a problem using just GraphPad#Yes my thoughts exactly.  I have had bad experiences in the past with students not understanding which test to choose or how to do it, which is why I prefer Prism as it will guide you based on your data input.  My colleague is more of a purist though - he was implying that I'm lazy in not doing the tests 'properly'.  #My thoughts exactly.  I'm confident with Graphpad that I know which tests I'm doing and why (I would argue this is the most important thing to know!)  He seems to think we will have trouble getting results published stating that we used Graphpad though - I'm interested if anyone has ever experienced this.  I have not.#At the end of the day you are using the built in statistical packages in these languages to do most of the analysis. Whether you load it in R and type t.test() or press the t-test button in graphpad, it's still going to give you the same output. If you really wanted to be a purist on the other hand you could shun modern technology and simply do these tests by hand. After all, they were designed in the days of yore when we didn't have these fancy computing machines.#It is a scientific statistical software... If there would be a problem with using it and publishing it would be known.#It might more be the question if the test you can do in Prism are good to use for your big data... Or if there are more appropriate test in the other programs. Anyway. A t-test in all 3 programs will give you the same results...#Thank you - I may just officially quote you to back me up#:-) good luck

And I think you should be too.";"I got into CS because I enjoyed the subject matter and I love programming. The pay check was always just a nice bonus on top. Thankfully. If I was in the field for the money, I'd be devastated at how much marketing bullshit there is for tech pay in general.Those six figure base salaries you hear about? They're usually in areas where renting or buying your own place is going to cost you a minimum of $20,000 (or more) a year if you want to be in a decent area that isn't too far from work. You can get around this with cheaper rent but a soul-crushing commute that will destroy your body even faster from all the sitting.Don't forget that this is a very tough career - you'll be working a lot in order to earn that salary. There's a lot of competition, and for the career paths making $150,000 or more...(think machine learning, big data, finance)...you'll be spending most of your waking hours working or thinking about work. There are definitely exceptions to the rule, but getting into those fields requires some coveted education and some grueling hours.It's certainly a good career choice if you're looking to be a career man/woman. But you won't be getting rich or even that well off working for someone else, and that isn't going to change just because it's ""tech."" Don't chase the dragon - if you want a big pay check, there are other avenues that are going to be much better for your pocket book all things considered. Time to temper your expectations for the field - computer science isn't some bastion of well-paid jobs in an economy of low-paying jobs.

They're usually in areas where renting or buying your own place is going to cost you a minimum of $20,000 (or more) a yearYet you still end up having more disposable income after rent, how is this so hard to grasp?#I respect the fact that you are an impassioned programer who don't need no money, but passion is not the primary motive most people have when deciding on what career to embark upon. Also with CS you can make 60k starting out in low cost areas in the midwest and the south. While these prospects are not as high as the west coast they stand as a testament to the value of being a programmer in terms of return on time invested/college debt. The average salary in those areas pale in comparison to a 22 year programmer. In addition, don't write off electricians and plumbers as having easy work, the jobs can be very labor intensive and can work very long hours depending on circumstances such as outages or other regular acts of god.  #The COL argument comes up every once in a while, but it doesn't really hold since it's the difference you care about and not the ratio. E. g. you're better off paying 30K a year in rent out of the 100K you have in hand post-tax, than paying 10K a year out of 50K somewhere in the mid-west. Also, maybe your experience differs, but 40-45 hour weeks seem to be the norm. Younger people might think it's a good idea to spend all day at work, but people with family/SOs/hobbies are pretty much out at 5.#I'm going to disagree with you in just about every point you made.> They're usually in areas where renting or buying your own place is going to cost you a minimum of $20,000 (or more) a yearGranted paying for rent in Silicon Valley isn't easy, but the pay for top companies scales so much higher than the rent and other costs, that it's worth it financially.

You don't have to seek the most difficult ones. You can easily carve a nice career for yourself not pursuing the most difficult fields.

That's what you would be getting now after 15 years experience.  Programming gets that with somewhere between 0 and 5 years.#> An electrician or a plumber will NOT be making more than you as a programmer unless you're being paid far below the average.Not true at all.  I know a master electrician that makes more than 100K.  He has been in the field for almost 20 years.What you should mean is CS allows you to make a higher salary up front oppose to a lot of other jobs where all the higher salaries are back loaded to the later parts of your career.#In theory yes. In practice in the US, the other differences are miniscule compared to housing.#Sure, but aside from rent, CoL in the bay area is much more reasonable. Yeah, some things might be more expensive, but you'll still be able to save much more. I was able to save between $5k and $6k per month when I was interning in the bay area, that's more than what I'd earn (before taxes and insurance) as full-time engineer in Germany. And while rent and food were indeed more expensive, all the fancy stuff I bought would cost the same, if not more, in Germany. #If you like to drink, alcohol (from stores, not bars) is actually cheaper in the Bay Area than anywhere else I've lived in the USA.Important life expense.  -)

You can get some of those parts cheaper on eBay if you do not mind using eBay.  The processors together should cost about the same as one processor you have listed if you buy them on eBay.  Make sure to get the SR0KX stepping because there was a bug in the first stepping that broke VT-d.  You might not want to do hardware passthrough now, but you never know what you might want to do in the future.For RAM, you can save money going for used registered ECC 1333 memory on eBay.  You can get 16GB for somewhere in the neighborhood of $40.  Unless you upgrade to E5 v2s, you are not going to notice a difference with 1866 memory in that setup.  Also, with the E5s, you can put more ECC RAM in the system than non-ECC memory.  Depending on the VMs you are running, you might need more memory.For the power supply, you are going to need one with two EPS (8 pin) connectors for the motherboard.  I think the only you listed has them, but it is something you will want to double check before pulling the trigger.For an SSI EEB board, you will likely need a full tower, but it sounds like you are good to go there.#I found the 16 GB sticks of RAM to be a better value for my build. That board can go up to 512gb but the 32gb modules are super expensive and the 16gb can be purchased for $80 each.Also, you can get those processors on eBay for about $80 less each depending on the market. Make sure to get the model SR0KXMake sure your case supports SSI EEB. And buy power supply cable extensions.

I'm not really that interested in low level programming and thats not the way I want to go career-wise so I'm leaning more towards MBD, although idk if the knowledge from CA would be more beneficial and harder to learn outside of uni as opposed to self-learning MBD stuff. What's your recommendation?;Do MBD if you're not interested in CA. CA people are fanatics and will destroy you#Thanks everyone, yeah I've decided to go with MBD#Haha, you are sadly correct.

MLQuestions;5ys8zl;1489231646.0;/r/MLQuestions/comments/5ys8zl/size_of_dataset_and_the_limit_to_train/;Size of dataset and the limit to train scikit-learn model?;Hi, newbie here. I'm just wondering, from most of the dataset that Ive seen in [kaggle](https://kaggle.com), they are only a few MB. Is there any particular limits on how big the data I can use to train and build model using scikit-learn? A lot of big data articles I've read say that big data would have GB and up to TB of data. Does that GBs of data only for 1 dataset or actually a combination of multiple dataset? Sorry if this is a noob question;We currently use scikit-learn in production (as part of auto_ml) across tens of millions of events, and hundreds of features for each event. To give you a sense of how much data scikit-learn can handle, we recently maxed out a box with 128GB of RAM only because one of the algorithms needed to densify a sparse matrix at prediction time. Otherwise, it was easily fitting into a low few dozen GB of RAM. For what it's worth, we use [auto_ml](https://github.com/ClimbsRocks/auto_ml), where I recently incorporated Microsoft's LightGBM. They handle categorical columns more memory-efficiently than scikit-learn does, so it's even easier for us to run Medium Data datasets of millions of things on a laptop. It's fun to geek out on speccing out an enormous ML box with an even more enormous GPU, but if you're working with tabular data (most non-image kaggle competitions), you can make it work on any semi-decent laptop. #Think of the Cambridge Analytica descriptions of their data set.  They have some 5,000 data points on each of 250,000,000 Americans.  Estimate that each data point is up to 10 bytes of data.  That gives 12.5 million million bytes.  Megabyte = 1 million B.  Gigabyte = 1 billion B or 10 to the 9.  Terabyte = 10 to the 12.  So Cambridge Analytica has 12 Tetrabytes of data.  That much disk space in a tidy rack will cost you about $1000 to purchase, or roughly half that per year if you rent it.  Conclusion: most of what is called big data is not that big.  It gets big when you have lots of images or video. Even music or speech aren't that large.  Generally the tools on the market are fine with these data volumes.   Its processing time that get long, and that is where GPU arrays (eg Amazon's EC2 versions) come in.#The limit is the amount of RAM you have on your machine. Also, some algorithms use more memory than others.#Thanks. #thanks. so normally 16gb is more enough for normal ML problems in kaggle?#I just responded with a more detailed answer, but in short, yes, 16GB is fine for most (not quite all) ML problems for Kaggle.

AppleWatch;5x5coi;1488482941.0;/r/AppleWatch/comments/5x5coi/new_aw_wearer_small_annoyances_and_limitations/;New AW Wearer: Small Annoyances and Limitations;I recently got an Apple Watch Series 2 to replace my Microsoft Band. Despite having an iPhone, Macbook Pro, iPad, and AppleTV, for the last 2 years I wore a Microsoft Band (Gen 1 and 2). The MS Band, ironically enough was nearly perfect for my desired features: GPS running, pedometer, sleep tracker, and alarm.  I really liked the big data analysis MS was/is doing with MS Health pulling together data from the myriad of sensors (i.e. you sleep more/less than the average male your age).  I went into the AW knowing it wasn't as tightly focused on fitness and have been impressed with the battery life, the screen, and notification. But, feels like I'm fighting a bunch of small annoyances or limitations for things that should be fairly simple or inconsequential. * Why do I need to install a 3rd part app to get step count on the watch face?* Why can't I set a set count goal (can only get move goal)* No native sleep tracker* Why does the screen turn off when in nightstand mode?  * Sharing walk/run calibration data?  I know RunKeeper currently doesn't do indoor non-GPS tracking using this data. Do any?* Ran using workout app and run didn't migrate over to RunKeeper (likely a RK issue) * Similarly, why do I need to go back to the phone for a consolidated Health dashboard/app? * Heart Rate sensor isn't as consistent;">it wasn't as tightly focused on fitnessI would say the Apple Watch is _very_ focused on fitness.>Why do I need to install a 3rd part app to get step count on the watch face?[Steps aren't real](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/5o0vhu/looking_for_a_solution_for_apple_watch_step/dcfqxk3/). I'd recommend just sticking to the Activity rings, as it's a better measure of...err... activity.>No native sleep trackerThis is a fair annoyance. But I'd like to counter that sleep tracking is kind of silly. If you wake up and you're tired, you didn't sleep well or enough. I've also never seen an accurate sleep tracker in my life. [Pillow](https://neybox.com/pillow/) comes close, though.>Why does the screen turn off when in nightstand mode?Another fair annoyance. I always thought it was because you wouldn't want the display acting as a small light source while you were trying to get to sleep. This is the reason I stopped buying proper nightstand clocks. Also, that tap-the-table-to-wake is so nice and convenient.>Sharing walk/run calibration data? I know RunKeeper currently doesn't do indoor non-GPS tracking using this data. Do any?I'm not sure what you mean, but the built in Exercise app will do indoor walks/runs.>Ran using workout app and run didn't migrate over to RunKeeper (likely a RK issue)I've only used RunKeeper a handful of times, but it might just be an issue with the RunKeeper app updating from HealthKit. Sometimes, MyFitnessPal won't ""pick up"" my workouts until after I open the Activity app. Kinda weird.>Similarly, why do I need to go back to the phone for a consolidated Health dashboard/app?It's partly because the data lives on the phone (it doesn't sync via iCloud or anything, for privacy reasons) and because Apple just hasn't figured out how to cram all of that information in to a UI that works on a 1"" screen. But mostly, it's because the data lives on the phone. The Watch can record data and send it over, and read the data when connected, but it won't sync the two over so you can view your data without the phone.>Heart Rate sensor isn't as consistentMake sure the watch is on snug and the sensors are clear.#To add to /u/shapeshiftingrobot's last point, see DC Rainmaker's review of the AW2 for wrist placement for the heart rate monitor:  [DC Rainmaker's review](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2017/02/apple-watch-series2-nike-edition-review.html)#> I would say the Apple Watch is very focused on fitness.Setting aside the fact that Apple sold the original AW as a fashion accessory and not a fitness device I'd quibble with you there historically.  If you're just talking about Series 2 then I'd say it's a matter of pulling it all together to more coherently.  Objectively it is still missing some sensors (i.e. barometer) that other fitness devices have.  So far in my week with the Series 2, it seems the fitness aspect to be a case of ""jack of all, master of none"" device where it does most things adequately but none that outshines a Garmin, for example. This likely boils down to the Apple Watch, despite being repositioned for fitness, is still a multipurpose device and can't be everything to everybody. > steps aren't real. I'd recommend just sticking to the Activity rings, as it's a better measure of...err... activity.Thats a very Apple like ""we know best for you"" comment.  I certainly can see Apple designing their UI to only highlight that they in their paternalistic mindset think it best for you, but the rest of the market accepts steps as a reasonable metric - even if it isn't ""the best.""  #I think we're both right about the marketing. The bands and more expensive models said ""fashion item"", but the ""Sport"" branding around the most affordable model was very fitness driven. The idea of swapping bands and faces is really about versatility though. But even the current marketing campaign is all about the fitness aspects. The GPS and waterproofing is specifically for fitness stuff.As for the steps, it's debatable. While many other bands do use steps, Nike (Apple's partner and consultant here) always used their own metric. It just makes little sense to obfuscate active calories when the question to answer is ""how many calories did I burn?""Maybe it is an Apple-y answer, but it makes the most sense. If you're trying to lose weight or stay active, what better than to have the actual numbers?#From an objective standpoint you are correct and I agree that calories are what matters.  Cutting calories is how I lost weight. That said, steps however flawed is something simple for someone to conceptualize.  ""I need to do x more steps to meet my goal for today"".  Steps are very actionable... ""x/y calories"" is obtuse.  #Just wanted to check in and say I agree with your points, esp. that apple watch in terms of fitness is a jack of all trades, master of none. I think people who used other fitness trackers before Apple watch will tend to feel this way. The whole thing feels very fragmented in comparison to fitness only trackers like Garmin and fitbit, and needs a lot of user research to find the apps that work for what we want it to do--want heart rate graphs? Download motifit for workouts, there still isn't a decent one for heart rate when not working out. And in my opinion, though steps may be a 'meaningless' metric, it's a lot more concrete than calorie loss, like you said. It's pretty much a mystery what algorithms apple watch is using to calculate calorie burn, and this it feels like a very vague thing to work for. Steps are obsess-able, and get people motivated to move more. Also, when I had a fitbit, I could look at the screen and see the numbers counting as I walked. With Apple watch, even with a steps app, it only updates every 5-10 seconds. It's just not as satisfying. On the other hand, apple watch is head and shoulders above any fitness trackers in design and quality, and needless to say, has a lot of functionality as a smart watch. I just wish there weren't any compromises. "
learnpython;5yl2bm;1489135674.0;/r/learnpython/comments/5yl2bm/can_anyone_offer_any_suggestions_as_to_what_kind/;Can anyone offer any suggestions as to what kind of programming I should focus on?;"I wanted to ask this here because this community has always been so supportive and I am currently feeling really stuck. I love programming, I can literally do it all day long, and since I started learning to program it has changed my life. I can build things, I can do all kinds of awesome stuff and it feels like I have all the power in the world at my fingertips (literally) but there's just SO much out there. There's backend and frontend, but that's just the beginning, you have people who focus on apps and content creation, pentesters, there are likely as many types of programming jobs as there are other jobs, because computers are everywhere now. I have to admit, I'm really struggling. I know the types of programming I love, and the kind I really don't care much for, and but I don't really know exactly what kind of job would let me do what I love. I really could care less about money, as long as I make enough to support myself (meaning food, shelter, and being able to afford to update my PC setup every couple years) I am content. I was hoping that somebody who's maybe been in my situation, would have some advice. Here's a couple things I really enjoy:I love mathematical programming, convolutions, summations, turning for loops and lists into sigma and setsI enjoy studying and implementing algorithms and trying to invent my own versions of existing algorithmsI really enjoy string manipulation and type manipulation, I like to really push my programs to the limit, I tend to write dense powerful functions that often end up being overly dynamic! (By overly dynamic I mean things like performing dynamic list creation when you don't know how many lists you need using exec('for I in range({}):\n\tmy_list{}=[]'.format(x,y)) or just stuff similar to that! )I love functions and functional programming, I never really liked classes, I can use them, I understand when they are valuable, I just don't like them. I am proficient in Python, and learning Java, PHP, and SQL currently. What types of jobs might be a good fit for me? I was thinking big data because the idea of having billions of data points to sift and sort through is super exciting, but I really want to hear from people who have experience in the field! TLDR: I really like programming, but I'm not really sure what ""type"" of programming I want to go into. I'm hoping to get either a better description of what different ""classes"" of programmers do, or to obtain recommendations on paths to look into based on my interests! ";[deleted]#If you are comfortable with math then try some GPU programming, maybe OpenGL or writing your own engine, either for general gaming or for physics. From there, you could either support games as a core developer, or you could go into simulations and predictions if you like physics more than graphics.As far as doing what you love, nothing pushes math and optimization harder than 3D virtual worlds. Games may carry a stigma with you as being a casual interest, but games involve real-time limitations and sometimes dense complex functions to pull off rendering while maintaining target FPS. A full AAA game hits nearly every aspect of computer science along the way, especially when hardware is limited.Big data is a big buzz word right now but honestly search / sort / run stats is only so interesting for so long. Yes, optimization comes into play which is fun but you could get bored with it as a whole.Now on the science side of things a ton of r&d involves huge data sets while also tapping math and functions all over the place. Climate simulations, human genome project, things like that.Just some ideas to ponder.#Have you tried shaders? have a play at https://www.shadertoy.com/ and if you like what you see, maybe look at Unity or UE4. Nothing rewards sneaky math tricks like shaders.#machine learning#Thank you for this! This is an absolutely excellent suggestion, and I actually have started to write a couple of modules but that makes me look at them in a whole new light! I will definitely get on that ASAP haha!

Every time I start a modded game with the vanilla intro or Live Another Live (shuffled), I can create a character and I have tried with multiple setups. The first was when I had a lot of FNIS related mods, ran the exe for new animations (with extensive research on what optional mods and FNIS plugins were needed), and used RC + RM, and the USLP with the various patches, SkyUI, and other necessary mods on all of the pages. I had HDT and all of my necessary compatible skeletons. For graphical purposes, I ran Realvision ENB with all of the recommended mods and tweaked the appropriate skyrim, skyrimprefs, enblocal, and SKSE inis in the mod organizer folder. After failing multiple tweaks to the setup to get it working, I tried removing all of the animation related mods and FNIS and simply going with all of the texture and additional land/quest/equipment mods that are not dependent on things I got rid of like the underground bathhouse.My rig:    (for parallel processing/gpu processing big data analysis in Python when not gaming)    Windows 7 64bit    NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti sc+    Intel i7-4930k CPU 3.4GHz    32 GB ram    I have a cheap monitor (next thing I am upgrading) that is only a recommended 1600x900 resolution    For the advanced display memory settings it shows:    Graphics Memory: 5857 MB    Dedicated Video Memory: 2048 MB    SVM: 0    Shared System Memory: 3809 MBNaturally memory shouldn't be an issue in this case. I'll link my ini memory settings, pap log during most recent crash, MO modlist, and MO loadorder. I have been fiddling with memory after reading numerous posts online about crashes at Helgen and most have recommended the memory patch (which I have) and/or alternative start because of the horrible scripting complications with the intro and tutorial.INIs:    enblocal    http://pastebin.com/0fJsC6SFskyrim    http://pastebin.com/8UUZkFvXskyrimprefs    http://pastebin.com/hr9hfJDimodlist    http://pastebin.com/wY4HfVhBload order    http://pastebin.com/UjeNBbBVSKSE.ini (memory patch settings)    http://pastebin.com/61PZD64yMost Recent Papyrus log    http://pastebin.com/Lr32g8qEIn the Papyrus log there are some things near the top mentioning mods I removed in MO like RaceMenu... From my understanding, the only things I run in my actual Skyrim folder are the 2 files from the ENB archive in the skyrim folder (the rest of ENB stuff is in MO mods section) and the TES5edit is ran outside when cleaning masterfiles (which is all that I cleaned with the EXACT same results as Gophers videos). I used to use NMM, so I am curious if there is more that I need to do when using MO to uninstall mods  since I had understood it that you do not need to worry about overwrites in the mod folders themselves but purely in the install and load orders when running the game through SKSE which is ran through MO?Anyway, if anyone has some advice or if you locate issues or know a fix, then that would be great. As it is, I have my entire Skyrim folder backed up from a vanilla install including backed up ini files purely set up for vanilla first execution. I would just like to avoid redoing all of the mods if possible...;> I used to use NMM> In the Papyrus log there are some things near the top mentioning mods I removed in MO like RaceMenuDid you fully clear out the Data folder from when you were using NMM? It sounds like there's still old files from a previous install.It also looks like you've tried to install SKSE through Mod Organizer, which isn't something you can do  it has to be installed directly to your Skyrim folder.#I should add that I ran the official enb sites vram test and I have over 22 GB worth lol (22144MB to be exact). So I am not sure what I should set things to since it said old formulas shouldn't be used.http://i.imgur.com/c6jSFgu.png#Well I changed things up and started from scratch after discovering various issues with SKSE versions and the realvision recommendations. I instead went with 353 mods focusing primarily on textures, new lands, vanilla town overhauls, and pretty much everything on this list and a few dozen of my own choices.http://textup.fr/183221zP I knew it shouldn't be an issue with my rig, after properly setting my inis based on these recommendations and using 512 or higher for LOD and 2k/4k textures when available, I don't have any CTD issues after 5 hours of playing.Took me a while to learn the proper order for merged patch, batched patch,  DynoDOLOD, FNIS, Dual Sheath Redux, etc. Basically I have this plus better water and different choices for movement when installing realistic animations project - movement. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PkcJCyStTk#I installed the most recent version through steam and Mod Organizer auto recognized it when I installed, but there was no SKSE folder with an SKSE.ini to edit for the memory patch, so I followed an online for creating said directory using MO, but it could have been incorrect. I'll try merging the skse files from MO to the Skyrim folder and see what happens.

No need to go to grad school if you just want to land an entry level job.It seems like you're failing the interview portions, so I would just cram ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" as much as possible. You should also be applying to more places. ~75 companies since August is far too little, that is a little over 10 applications per month. You should be aiming for 5+ applications a day.

And if there is more interest than you thought, you know it might be worth it to move there?#[deleted]#Perfect. A small tip. Once you find some companies, try to contact their recruiter personally. Its so tough to find people that they will be very happy at you reaching our personally, even if they pass. Or maybe just search for recruiters on Linkedin.If you decide that the response is better in the Bay Area, could you arrange to crash at your family members place?And then polish your resume, and carpet bomb the job sites like monster, careerbuilder, craigslist, and any other sites and upload your resume.

Accounting;5wod6x;1488293262.0;/r/Accounting/comments/5wod6x/us_internal_or_external_it_audit/;[US] Internal or External IT Audit?;As the title implies, I am attempting to decide between careers in external or internal IT audit. Currently, I have 1.5 years of experience working at a regional (DC area) public accounting firm, primarily for federal agencies. The work there is mostly in support of financial statement audits, with some advisory work mixed in as well. I have received an offer from the internal audit department of a financial corporation in the DC area, which I am considering, however my current firm has indicated that they would like me to stay, and that they believe that I have potential to make partner in 5-7 years.  In terms of compensation, the internal audit department offered a 10% pay bump, with a signing bonus, and overall has slightly better benefits/bonuses, however I think it is likely that my current firm would be willing to match (or possibly exceed) anything, though I won't know until I actually get a counteroffer. That being said, I'm looking at this less from a compensation perspective, and more from a long-term career one. Overall I think that I would like to work towards the C-suite (CISO or CIO), but I'm not dead set on anything. These are my thoughts:  **External Audit**  *Pros*  *I know the culture is relaxed, and I am already well-respected at my company  *Variety of clients, meaning a variety of experience  *Partners claim that they make significantly more than an equivalent position in internal audit  *I would potentially have the ability to help the company expand our service offerings (cyber security and data analytics were their thoughts)  *Cons*  *All work is federal, so I'm worried about being stuck in government work (not that I intend to move, but I don't like not having the option to)  *If I were given the option to help lead the company in new service offerings, that'd be great experience, but I would be concerned with doing things the wrong way since it would be lots of improvising  *Most people in external IT audit that I know seem to stay in this field forever, so I'm not sure if staying in this field would be limiting down the road  **Internal Audit**  *Pros*  *The technology used is much more advanced (cloud-based environments, professional reporting software, and big data analytics tools)  *Rotation programs with the technology department, where members of the internal audit team frequently move to after a few years  *Gaining commercial experience, which I few as opening more doors (though that definitely could be an incorrect assumption)  *Cons*  *While the company with the offer appears to have a relaxed culture and nice people, I obviously don’t really know (Glassdoor reviews were mixed, overall good though)  *From reading other comments online, there seems to be a mixed outlook on whether internal audit provides room for career growth and high pay (vs eventually becoming a partner at a public accounting firm)  If you’ve made it this far, then thanks for reading, I know this is a long post. Does anyone have any experience with making a similar change, or any thoughts on how to approach this?  TL DR: two good opportunities, what do I do?;"A few thoughts:Your regional firm is bullshitting you with all the partner talk. Stop drinking the kool-aid. They are using an improbable future as justification for underpaying you.A 10% bump is not very good, especially for someone at your level where it simply isn't that much money.  You should be getting nearly 10% raises every year in external, especially if you are truly on ""the partner track"". If you aren't getting here that, refer back to my first point. External almost always promotes faster than internal. While internal pays more for equal positions, you can get to a higher position (and thus more pay) faster with external. Final thought: it's confusing that you only have 1.5 years experience but your statements make it sound like you are at a manager level. Either there's some facts I'm missing, or you are over-estimating how much your firm cares about you. I'm guessing the latter, but I could be wrong.#What exactly will you be auditing in internal? SOX? PCI, if its a variety of different things it might be worth, if its just SOX then you'll be bored out of your mind? Also the rotation program, why not just jump into that right away, instead of going into internal audit? It sounds like that's the exciting opportunity that you hope to get.I'm in internal audit, just moved in it about 8 months ago. It sucks, I don't see any career progression, the side projects that I do at my company are way more interesting than the actual audit work. If I were you, I'd apply for the rotation program right away, rather than go through internal audit.#Thanks for the response!   >Your regional firm is bullshitting you with all the partner talk. Stop drinking the kool-aid. They are using an improbable future as justification for underpaying you.  I can definitely see the talk about becoming partner being talk, and it doesn't really factor into my decision, though it’s good to hear someone else say that. I wouldn’t say that I’m underpaid, since I my salary is similar to what Glassdoor tells me comparable positions at other firms average at, and I’m pretty young for my position. However, there is definitely the argument to be made that if the firm is willing to pay more, then I’m underpaid, but this honestly was not a complaint for me.  >A 10% bump is not very good, especially for someone at your level where it simply isn't that much money. You should be getting nearly 10% raises every year in external, especially if you are truly on ""the partner track"". If you aren't getting here that, refer back to my first point.  I've gotten two ~15% raises in the 1.5 years here, so pay definitely was not a problem for me. I actually included the 10% figure to demonstrate that the pay difference was not massive (again, good to get confirmation).  > External almost always promotes faster than internal. While internal pays more for equal positions, you can get to a higher position (and thus more pay) faster with external.  I had not considered this, and I did have some reservations about growth potential in the internal shop.  >Final thought: it's confusing that you only have 1.5 years experience but your statements make it sound like you are at a manager level. Either there's some facts I'm missing, or you are over-estimating how much your firm cares about you. I'm guessing the latter, but I could be wrong.  I’ve been promoted twice since starting, though I would equate my position now to being a senior at a larger firm. One thing I’m keeping in mind is that the next promotion is to manager, which seems to occur within about 2 years here. I do think that the company cares, though I’ll make sure to put a strong effort into making an objective decision. Thanks for your input, I personally have a tendency to be a bit naïve in situations like this, so I appreciate an unbiased person with experience weighing in.#It will be a variety of things, not only regulatory compliance, but also infosec audits. The rotation described to me is done through internal audit, so I don't believe that it would be possible to get straight into that, but I'll look into it.> It sucks, I don't see any career progression, the side projects that I do at my company are way more interesting than the actual audit work.This is one of my bigger fears, when you say you don't see progression, do you mean that promotions are rare, or that everyone just does the same tasks endlessly, or what?#I guess, I mainly do regulatory compliance so its the same for me. I don't find it challenging, more just busy work I guess. "

These programs have their information from big data sources collected of years. Their decisions effect our entire life: They automatically order products on Amazon for consumer, and also determines how many products are made and finds the most efficient product chain. In the end it is similar to socialism (as defined by Hayek), but without the goal to accomplish equality.So planning increase efficiency, but limits freedom at the same time. What would be the the opinion of an Austro-Libertarian?;If your fancy algorithm improves my life or increases my business profitability, I'll choose it. If not, I'll choose another one. What's wrong with that?#What you're describing isn't planning, but rather a very sensitive reaction to people's wants. Planning prescribes what should be without regard for the individual. If we can have machines help exchanges happen in realtime according to people's wants then that would be the ultimate capitalism.#That´s a really good point: But it works if the machines are reacting to people´s needs in realtime. But they right now they are collecting data, and data is - like statistics - always about the past and never about the future. As soon as the machine realizes what an individual needs, it´s already a need from the past. So if Amazon automatically orders detergent, when the old one is nearly finished, Amazon does it, because Amazon´s data shows that in the past you ordered new detergent, when the old one is nearly finished. What happens if you don´t it need right now or you just want to change the brand? Amazon wants to know, when you are unsatisfied with your current product. So they have to collect more data to realize that. So even if Amazon´s supercomputer has every single information from your past, it would never know how you would act in the future. The consequence would be a standstill, because your future would be identical to your past.  #What you took in consideration, amazon will too, also, they don't have to right to order anything without your consent ^^

As a self-taught developer who is pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science via [OMSCS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/), is it wise to look for internships while still in the program? Or should I actually start to find a place where I plan on working at for the next 3 ~ 5 years?I am currently working at a startup as a senior developer, but I've been looking for a different job because I want to see what working at other companies are like and look for more guidance.I was initially interviewing for a senior developer position at a startup, but I was finally offered a junior developer position. I understand that my lack of an undergraduate degree in Computer Science could be a reason why they think I only deserve a junior role, and I totally understand that I don't really fit for a senior role either as I only have 2~3 years of experience. However, I've been helping a friend with his undergraduate degree in CS, so I know that I can't be THAATT bad either.So here's the question. I feel that I can learn tons as a junior developer at that startup, as I will be helping them with big data technology such as Cassandra, Spark, and distributed computing problem with micro-services. I am also in the process of interviewing with Facebook, and I'm just waiting to hear back from them(although I don't have much expectation from it.).In 1~2 years, with a combination of 4~5 years of experience, and a Master's degree, I think I will have a better chance at working at something that truly interests me. So what should I do in between? Is it better to find multiple internships in Canada(I live in Vancouver, and I'm not eligible for internships in US) for the next 1~2 years and find an area that interests me the most, while risk not being able to find any internship, OR find a place where I can learn a lot and potentially grow, but unsure whether the startup really interests me.;Why would you need an internship if you already have  dev job? #I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of opportunities simply because my experience is limited on a certain tech stack. Also, working at a small startup kind of limits me as I only work at a small scale for now, instead of something on a larger scale. For example, I only have minimal systems architecture experience because the application doesn't have a very high demand. Seeing what other companies handle large amount of traffic/etc can greatly help me with future jobs.

However, I went a route similar to your Option 2, and it worked out. If you go with Option 2 expect to work much harder than a college graduate.

Honestly it's the only way I would be able to afford studying there without falling into debt and still keep my finances secure and stable.No. I just got hired without my employer ever seeing my face. Also, there isn't a hiring manager that's brazen enough to mention it on the astronomically low chance that they recognize you.

It's going to take a lot of effort to get interviews by American companies while you're in Mexico. You're going to have to be 1) extremely talented 2) extremely visible. I say American companies because that's where the biggest players are.

I've read previous papers (Traveling the silk road, de-anonymizing users from transactions, etc...). Does anyone have any ideas of what I can use the data for? For instance, what cool things can I visualize with it? Maybe I can compare it with other currencies of the world to prove some point? Maybe analyze transaction volume to predict future transaction volume, etc... I'm relatively new to bitcoin so it's hard for me to think of something feasible and useful. Any ideas? Thank you.;"Here are some ideas:Usage stats. Adoption Rate (New Addresses included in the blockchain per unit of time) Address Reuse Rates (How many times is a bitcoin address used? What's the mean time between reuse?)Can you figure out how much of the blockchain is coinwashing and how much is legit stuff?I'd like to see a chart like http://themisescircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Bitcoin-Inflation.png where you can see all the coins produced over time but I also want to see how they're distributed among addresses or address groups for known-owners. So like a plot of all coins mined over time with the % of satoshi's coins highlighted, and other big vendors coins as a % of all coins mined #These are some great ideas, thank you. I'll look into them more.Any high level idea of how you'd go about seeing if transactions are ""coin washing""? Not exactly sure what that means.#Its called mixing.

I also think that I could learn a lot on technologies that will be important in the future (big data/machine learning and the like)I was basically offered the same salary that I have now, which I wasn't able to negotiate, but I would be receiving stock options and a ""Senior"" title.The thing is that I usually see a job change as a way to receive a better salary, and this subreddit seems to show that it is the case most of the time.Career-wise, do you think that such a move would be beneficial?";"My first job change took me from a company of over 150,000 employees to one that was 15 at its biggest. It was a good move for me. I learned that I like working for smaller companies where I can have broader responsibilities. If you've been at the bigger company for a few years, and gotten a sense of what that's like, I'd encourage you to take the new opportunity. View it as a learning experience: learn about how companies work (you'll see it in a lot more detail at a smaller company, if you keep your eyes open), and you'll learn about yourself. View the stock options as gravy -- there's a very real chance they won't be worth anything, but could turn into something really good. #>View the stock options as gravy -- there's a very real chance they won't be worth anything, but could turn into something really good.>Also my general advice is to consider the stock options to be worthless. Don't make any decision based on themSage advice there.Since it sounds like you will still get a good salary, it's the other facets that you should focus on. In a small start up like that, you will have a lot of influence over how things happen. You will also (likely) have to do multiple roles, or at the very least work with someone that is doing multiple roles. As an example your product guy might also be your project manager, and going working with sales as an ""evangelist"" so you may get limited specifications. That said - you should have a very clear vision of what the product you are trying to build is for. That what, and the why. So you may have a lot more autonomy in the how left up to you.Also, the senior title is meaningless. 15 person start ups have 9 VP's and everyone else is senior  )Start ups worth their salt are a lifestyle more than a job. If you have the energy and really dig what they are doing it can be *transformative* or it can destroy you from the inside out. (went from giant corp to start up, now on my 4th... LMK if you want additional thoughts.)#I'm about to make a switch to a new company without increasing my salary. The reason I'm making the move is that I feel like I'm no longer learning as much as I want to and I think I will be able to learn a lot at the new company. So I'm not gonna increase my salary with this switch, but hopefully it will make me a better developer so that I can cash in further down the line.#Mixed feelings as someone who has done it.  It's a lot more satisfying to work but the nagging feeling of whether the company will be around in the next 6 months gets annoying.Also my general advice is to consider the stock options to be worthless.  Don't make any decision based on them#You learn different things at a startup versus a big company. At a startup, you'll learn to be a generalist--you'll have to know how to do a little bit of everything because there's no one else there to do it otherwise. You'll also have bigger say in design decisions and your code will def ship. At a big company, you'll learn more about good practices. There will probably also be a lot of structure in place, so you'll get a good sense of how the software dev cycle should work. There will always be someone to learn from and you have the freedom to be a specialist. "

learnmachinelearning;5wfa1r;1488177586.0;/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/5wfa1r/outlier_detection_in_highdimensional_time_series/;Outlier Detection in High-Dimensional Time Series;"Since big data is all the rage these days, I've been asked at work to help develop an outlier detection system for streams of environmental data coming from a variety of sensors. Right now we're doing USL/LSL monitoring, but the goal is to capture multi-dimensional outliers and anomalous sequences that nonetheless may be within the normal bounds. The data consists of time-series measurements from T=0 to T=Tmax over a machine cycle, where Tmax is not guaranteed to be consistent from cycle to cycle. The sample period is fairly regular, but some data may be missing.Time (ms) | V1 | V2 | ... | P1 | P2 | ...----------|----|----|-----|----|----|----2 | 0.4 | 0.8 | ... | NULL | NULL | ...101 | 0.6 | 1.1 | ... | 0.5 | 0.6 | ...199 | 0.9 | NULL | ... | 0.5 | 0.64 | ...... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... Tmax | V1(Tmax) | V2(Tmax) | ... | P1(Tmax) | P2(Tmax)I've spent the past few days taking a deep dive into machine learning literature, and I think I have an understanding of the high-level steps I need to take, but the sheer variety of approaches for each step is a little overwhelming. Right now, my concerns are mainly focused around two steps:1\. Transform time-series data into point-space data  * It appears that there are a variety of methods here: DFT, LSSA, wavelet decomposition, polynomial regression, etc. I know that the best way to choose is to evaluate performance against actual data, but is there a recommended ""standard"" method to start with?      * How is correlation between decomposed vectors usually handled? For example, if take a matrix of 3-dimensions x 10000 samples, and decompose each dimension into 20 frequency components, so that the transformed data is a single 60-dimensional vector, is there anything special that needs to be done to account for the fact that each group of 20 dimensions isn't independent?      * How should Tmax be handled? Should it be included as its own dimension? If so, how should it be weighted against the other dimensions?2\. Identify outliers, and most-significant dimensions  * From what I can tell, two major approaches seem to be Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and Isolation Forests  * I have three reservations about the LOF method 1) some sort of dimensionality reduction will be required to avoid the ""curse of dimensionality"". I found a paper on the PINN method [1], which seems promising, but there don't seem to be any implementations that I can find 2) some sort of normalisation will be required to prevent the axis scale from dominating distance calculations, but how do I evaluate what counts as ""dominating""? 3) The LOF seems to be highly dependent on the distance metric chosen. Most implentations seem to use Euclidean distance. However, if spectral analysis is performed in step 1, is Euclidean distance an accurate distance metric in the frequency domain? Is it worth looking for an implentation that uses log-spectral distance?  * From my limited understanding, the two major advantages of isolation forests are that 1) they have a certain degree of scale invariance because they don't use a distance metric for classification and 2) they have dimensionality reduction ""built-in"" because each tree is constructed from a random sample of dimensions. Is this an accurate characterisation?  * The largest challenge that I see is identification of which dimensions contributed the most to a datum being considered an outlier. This seems like it potentially would be easier with the LOF method (do an O(n) search in the k-neighborhood of an outlier, projecting each n-vector into (n-1) space and rank dimensions based on which causes the greatest change to the LOF score), but the couple of tools that I've found so far don't support this out-of-the-box. I'm not sure how to even approach this problem with the isolation forest method, which is why I'm still considering LOF as an option.    I'm also having trouble finding any literature on this problem. The closest I've found is [2], which only discusses anomalies in sequences of discrete symbols. I know it's possible to map continuous data to symbolic data [3], but I'm not sure how it would be applied to multi-dimensional data, or how the performance compares to LOF or isolation forests.  * Another random thought I had was using either an N-order Markov Model, or an LSTM autoencoder/decoder to calculate the prediction error for each time step, but I am not sure how to account for the variable sampling intervals, the variable sequence length, or the continuous multivariate aspect of the data.If anyone could point me in the right direction for researching methods, or if anyone has any suggested implementations (I'm sure this is far from a unique problem), that would be very much appreciated. So far I've looked at scikit-learn and Jubatus. I know R is popular for data analysis, but I'm not familiar with the language or with its libraries. I know Amazon offers anomaly detection through [AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/sqlref/random-cut-forest.html), but I need something on-premise (besides the fact that it doesn't analyse which dimensions are anomalous).Sorry for the long post, but I had a bunch of related questions and didn't want to split them all up individually.**tl dr*** Doing outlier detection for high-dimensional time series data* What are current state-of-the-art methods for time-series compression/regression?* What are current state-of-the-art methods for outlier detection, including detecting which dimensions are anomalous?Thanks in advance.**Refs**1\.

A Symbolic Representation of Time Series, with Implications for Streaming Algorithms (Lin, Keogh, et al., 2003)";"Hi,this is a really broad problem (as you've gathered), and I don't believe there is one best way to do this. I work in a similar field (environment sensors in buildings), so I can share some of my thoughts on the general approach.Firstly and foremost: don't try to solve this problem in the general case immediately - try to break down the problem into subproblems which you can reasonably attempt to solve. Finding point outliers in high dimensional space is a different problem from finding arbitrary length subsequence outliers, and you probably will need to think hard about the problem domain to reduce the complexity in the latter case. It's also tempting to try to approach the problem in a context-agnostic fashion, avoiding the use of domain-specific knowledge such as the properties/behaviour of the sensors or physical systems to try to get a totally 'general' method - this is a way harder problem. For example, is there a natural periodicity or subsequence length in the data, such as daily cycles, that allows you to partition the stream into windows? This can make things much easier.LOF models, either distance, density, or entropy based, all work pretty well (and similarly) in my opinion. As you noted, they're going to vary dramatically on the metric chosen, and will perform better or worse depending on the particular problem/data. This kinda illustrates another huge obstacle - how do you actually go about comparing different models or approaches? Without some kind of yardstick to actually assess your solution, you're stuck just manually investigating the data and results to see if it makes sense. I've found that there's no free lunch - there's no single algorithm which works best in all scenarios. It's a matter of qualifying the outcomes which are of greatest importance to the business, and designing against those criteria.Identifying the dimension which contributes most to the outlier can be hard. If you're doing some kind of subspace embedding method, sometimes you can use the reconstruction error to determine along which dimensions the anomaly occurs. This works really well with something like an autoencoder/manifold embedding approach. Alternatively, with an isolation forest approach, you might interpret the output as a binary classification, and utilise something like [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) to construct a locally valid linear approximation to the decision surface to understand what factors contribute. I've only played with this a bit, but it seemed to look promising. There's also the 'brute force' approach of just scrambling input dimensions one by one and observing which has the greatest impact on the outlierness :) It's tricky in general because it's really hard to make sense of the results here. In some cases maybe you can visually understand why one particular sensor measurement is an outlier, but other times it's the whole joint distribution of the system which is in a low-probability state, and each individual sensor is regular-looking, so there's no way to really know.As for LSTM autoencoder, this is a pretty dramatic leap in complexity from the other approaches, both from and engineering and computational resources point of view. You would probably need to choose a sequence length to partition the data over, and there are going to be tons of hyperparameters to more or less manually explore. I've found that tools like variational autoencoders *do* work extremely well here, but they are rather finicky, and slow (particularly for LSTM) relative to other approaches. One nice thing approach this approach is that you can continuously update the model as data streams in, giving you an 'online' solution. The current solution I use is a combination of a couple approaches - a VAE + an isolation forest + streaming KDE. You can use the reconstruction error of the vae to identify outliers, and sometimes you can do something like an LOF approach *in the latent space* of the VAE to help with this. There's lots of literature on this topic, but in my experience, everybody just builds a solution which solves whatever problem they're working on best, making appropriate assumptions for their domain. Sorry if this post seemed like a non-technical ramble. The TLDR is: there's no free lunch, try to isolate sub-problems which you can construct metrics to evaluate desirable business outcomes, and solve those problems first. Favour low-complexity solutions first over brittle sophisticated ones, until you can quantify the improvement they'd yield. It's better to get something into production that's 50% better than what you have currently in the near future than to labour for ages trying to get something like a variational LSTM working for uncertain gains.Some papers which come to mind:* [Literature Review of Anomaly/Novelty Detection](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~davidc/pubs/NDreview2014.pdf)* [Variational Inference for On-line Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Time Series](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07109.pdf)* [ICML 2016 Anomaly Detection Papers](https://sites.google.com/site/icmlworkshoponanomalydetection/accepted-papers)  #Interesting problemAs a baseline, you should test Time Series Discords, why?1) Very competitive: ""..on 19 different publicly available data sets, comparing 9 different techniques (time series discords) is the best overall technique among all techniques. Chandola, Cheboli, and Vipin Kumar 2009""2) Almost parameter free (just one parameter, the length of the subsequence), no tweaking or tuning. 3) They can be discovered very very fast, and incrementally maintained in streams.4) Matlab code is available [a]. There are a few fast algorithms for finding discords, but the Matrix Profile [a] is the best, and as a side effect, does a dozen other things. If you look here [b], you can see some examples on diverse data sets. You might need to adapt in minor ways for ""multi-dimensional"" time series.By the way, you asked ""is Euclidean distance an accurate distance metric in the frequency domain?"" The answer is, it is the same! See [c].[a] http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html[b] http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/Matrix_profile_samples.pptx[c] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parseval's_theorem#Hi adcqds,Thanks for the long and detailed reply, you've certainly given me a lot more to think about and read through. That link to LIME looks especially interesting. I'm thinking I will try running an LOF model and isolation forest model side-by-side and comparing what the performance looks like when operating on real data.You mentioned the importance of being able to evaluate model performance, but do you have any suggestions for how to do so? The only metric I can think of would be to have a pseudo-ROC keeping track of the proportion of silenced alarms to all alarms over some time period (maybe a 24-hour sliding window). A normal ROC calculation wouldn't be possible because the source data is unlabeled.I've also had some luck and found more papers specifically talking about identification of significant dimensions. Specifically, [Finding Intensional Knowledge of Distance-Based Outliers](http://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Lehre/Hauptseminar/WS0607/papers/KnoNg99.pdf), has been cited by a number of papers, so I've been making my way through all of that related literature. I'll keep this post updated as I decide on a clearer direction.Thanks again for all the help."

This sharing is purely my own initiative.Recently, I provided work for a startup which core team comprise of neuroscientists and engineers. The closest one I worked with published over 250 publications in areas relating to mental health. They developed a platform where you can use big data analytics to assess and manage brain and mental health disorders. What that means is, the platform analyzes many aspects of your 'being' - ie your blood type, your behaviour, your moods, your brainwave pattern, your facial recording, etc - and makes a personal assessment from there. If it detects something (it can even detect early-stage conditions, which is pretty cool imo), the AI advisor will give recommendations on what exactly to do. For example, if memory is worsened (early-stage dementia), it'll give brain training games. There are other recommendations in the platform. The platform is not ready yet and scheduled to be launched in July 2017. They are doing a crowdfunding campaign now. I won't share the link in case it's frowned upon here, but I do want to give this heads up to the community. You can PM me for their name though, I'll be happy to share privately.Have a good day y'all ;I've never seen a reputable neuroscience journal cite blood type, ethnicity or facial expressions as indicators of mental health issues. Are you sure this is legit? Is this FDA approved in the first place?#Genetic definitely plays a part - that we know for sure. Facial expression detects stress and anxiety, according to my colleagues.Fair point about approval. It's not medication so no relation with FDA. They're still raising funding for the product

You request a bunch of data for a certain time period to be processed, it loads all of the data for that time period from HDFS into memory and then filters/processes it. If you ask for too much data (more than can fit into memory), then it crashes.I'm trying to change that. If a very long time period is requested, the system should break the job into smaller chunks so that it doesn't crash. Pretty simple so far. However, now people are talking about [unifying streaming and batch](https://www.datanami.com/2016/06/01/merging-batch-streaming-post-lambda-world/). This sounds a lot like what I need.I basically have two options: I could re-write the Spark job in a conventional way to load smaller chunks of data into RAM to be processed, or I could try to use Spark Streaming to do the batching. Should I use Spark Streaming in a circumstance like this? Or is the Spark Streaming technology not appropriate for this kind of application?Thanks for your help!;[edited: formatting] I'm going to go with yes definitely - interestingly there's two different approaches you could take:* Put the HDFS data into something like Kafka  the down side here is that you have a large movement of data* Put a reference to the HDFS data in Kafka and rely on the Spark Job to read it when processingIf you are going to use streaming, I would use the approach which leaves the HDFS data off the event channel.As always, interested to see what other approaches could be taken.#Bottomline question is - can you actually shard or chunk your processing into independent units? If so, yes, streaming is great. But if you need to look at all the data, do aggregations and joins and what not on the entire dataset, then you cannot escape loading all of it into memory. You could do things like partitioning but that is about it.#So do you feel that Spark Streaming and Kafka are inextricably intertwined? To the point where if I'm going to use Spark Streaming at all, then I'm definitely going to be using Kafka as well in some capacity?I'm not opposed to using Kafka, but I wasn't thinking about using it in this scenario, because the data is sitting on HDFS (the same machines that Spark workers are on), and our Kafka machines are on different nodes, which would mean your first architecture would involve moving the data from one set of nodes to another set and then back again. Is Kafka worth the trouble for something like this?#That's an excellent point. I suppose that there may be some situations where I need to do something on at least a large portion of the dataset... I'll have to think about it.Perhaps I could go with a hybrid approach where I stream chunks of data through for the first few filter operations, potentially giving me much smaller volumes of data to deal with when I do something that involves the whole (remaining) data.

However you also mention that the syllabus for the 2 programs are basically the same.  This confuses me greatly and makes me think that someone who doesn't know the field named the programs.  Obviously, the course of study is what I would look at over the name, but if those are the types of things I wanted to study, I would absolutely prefer it to be named ""Data Science"".  Here is my take on the meanings of each:Data Science:  That's high level analytics and making sense (including predictive) of data and information that you have or gather.  The courses listed certainly fit within that category. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scienceInformation Systems: That's the running of the servers and applications needed to keep the company running from a technology or computer perspective.  So setting up servers and making sure each user has Office installed appropriately and connected to the network to share information.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system#Every university will treat these subjects differently, but they are not the same.  Information systems is broad.  It looks at the ""systems"" in place to collect, process and distribute information/data.  This includes networking hardware, servers, databases, etc.  Data science is quite simply the study of data in all its forms this includes a lot of math (stats and such), information systems, databases, etc. The focus here would be on management and understanding data and how it is collected, structured and accessed.  It goes beyond IT use cases.That being said, each university will allow the professor to cater the course to their strong suits and there is some overlap.  Also, many universities suck at creating pertinent IT courses that are relevant to the job market and often confuse courses.  So it's best to read the course description and syllabus carefully.TL/DR:  Data science will have a strong math focus and primarily discuss the data in all its forms.  Information systems will talk about the IT systems that create, store, and serve data on a network."

We're a medium sized (~250 person) company located in midtown east (46th & 3rd) and have been around since 2000. I like to explain our product in the following way… Imagine Microsoft Excel (a tabular spreadsheet view of data). Put that in a web browser so we have something similar to Google Sheets. Now take 100 billion - 1 trillion rows of data, put them in a single spreadsheet, and maintain the ability to manipulate that data in real time. You can create new columns that are a function of other columns, filter and aggregate the data, run more advanced statistical analyses, visualize the data, or build a data driven web application. That's the Trillion Row Spreadsheet and it's the core product that the rest of our business is built around.Most of our server side code is written in k, which is a pretty cool language that I'm not going to discuss at length. k is an excellent tool for vector processing and distributed computing, but there are some tasks it's not well suited for, and that's where this job post becomes relevant. The Core Group at 1010data (the devs that build the product described above) includes the ""Interfacing Team"" which is responsible for two things. First, we solve the problems that k isn't well suited for. This consists of implementing some of the very high performance bits of the system that don't vectorize well, as well as integrating third party tools as to avoid reinvention of the wheel (we didn't feel the need to implement AES in k). Second, we build the code distributed to customers (k is interpreted, we generally don't like to distribute the interpreter). This code is (again) very performance sensitive, but also must be very portable (we've targeted Windows, Linux, OSX, AIX, and HP-UX to name a few targets). Put most simply, the Interfacing Team is responsible for the code that isn't written in k or JavaScript (though we do in fact do some k programming).So what are we looking for? We want someone with C/C++/other-manually-memory-managed-language programming experience who is interested in building high performance tools and libraries for manipulating big data. Generally we look favorably on people with STEM degrees, though there is some preference for people with a computer science background (you're going to be asked algorithm questions and for Big-O analyses during the interview process).  We have positions open at the entry level, though we certainly won't turn away those with deeper experience.If you're interested you can reach out to me directly, or apply via our [careers page](https://www.1010data.com/company/careers/open-positions/position/?id=599812). I am the hiring manager for the team (so I won't get any sort of bonus for applications through that link) but reaching out to me directly can skip some of the recruiting rigmarole.";

marketing;5wk489;1488236295.0;/r/marketing/comments/5wk489/using_emotional_intelligence_in_marketing/;Using Emotional Intelligence in Marketing;Article Originally from: https://www.photonicpr.com/emotional-intelligence-marketing/#.WLSs2vkrJPY **What is Emotional Intelligence?**Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to be intelligent about your emotions, as well as the emotions of others. Author, Dr. Daniel Goleman, describes EI as being comprised of five key components:* Self-Regulation* Empathy* Social Skills* Motivation* Self AwarenessEmotional intelligence is an intangible in each of us. It affects how we manage behavior, navigate social complexities, and make personal decisions that achieve positive results. Individuals with a high level of EI are incredibly valued in businesses  people who demonstrate high EI make $28,000 more annually (on average) than their counterparts with low EI.Unlike your IQ which is fixed, your EI is something flexible which can be improved through continuous self-betterment with some effort.Let us examine how we can leverage the benefits of EI regarding dealing with our prospects, clients and even members of our communications teams.**Emotional Intelligence With Potential Customers**Chances are, everyone reading this has been on the receiving end of “spam”. If by some miracle you are unaware of the term, spam refers to unsolicited messages repeatedly sent to large groups of people, typically for the purpose of advertising. These messages usually have little or no relevance to the individual on the receiving end, making spam an annoyance to all, including the economy. In fact, it is estimated that spam emails cost businesses more than $20 billion per year.Then came the emergence of Big Data. Marketers were suddenly able to identify their target market’s interests, passions, buying preferences and so much more. It should have put an end to spam messaging. Digital messaging is slowly returning to its terrible roots. Due to poor practices by marketing professionals, more and more emails are being marked as spam and failing to reach prospects. There are some obvious reasons as to why this is occurring.**A) Listening Skills**A common mistake being made by marketers is their failure to hear. For example, a brand may have identified their target market and then quickly developed what they believe to be a perfect message to their recipient. But the marketing team did not pay attention to what their demographic was saying on social media platforms, for instance. It turns out their email marketing message completely misses the mark, and most of their prospects didn’t even open the email.To avoid this classic mistake, professional communications can benefit from Emotional Intelligence, particularly the pillars of Empathy and Social Skills. If this marketing team had paid attention to what their target audience was saying on social media channels before developing a message, they would have been able to understand the needs and wants of their prospects better.**B) Consent and Regulation**Another mistake often made when trying to attract potential clients is a tendency to abuse freely available data. It is worth remembering that when members of your target audience have no previous interaction with your brand, yet you go out of the way to get personal information on them, such as their email, the intent to solicit lacks consent. In other words, purchasing lists would be an example of this kind of behaviour, as would accessing their email off of an unrelated database. If you have access to the contact information of an individual and it feels wrong, chances are it is a bad choice.To avoid situations like this, marketers must remember the EI pillars of being self-aware and self-regulation. If you are not generating the leads you need, then perhaps it is time to rethink your brand’s marketing strategy. Instead of cold-emailing unqualified leads, try to introduce context. Imagine you work for a company that sells fancy cakes. One of your lead generation strategies is to send emails to people who visit a popular designer pastry website. The emails that you send are personalized and friendly and also include a recipe for a cake. As well, the email contains invitations to visit the website to learn more.In the example above, the people being emailed are already somewhat qualified (interested in high-quality pastries), so the email sent would not be cold and received with hostility. Your brand also offers the recipient value in the form of a free recipe which begins to establish a positive brand reputation as soon as the email is opened. Finally, the email includes an invitation to your brand’s website. This is your call to action, and it is the action that you want the recipient to take from the email.**C) The Pareto Principle**Emotional intelligence is used for far more than just digital targeting. Once you have attracted, a client is when EI arguably becomes the most useful. I am sure many of you have heard of the Pareto Principle – the theory that 80% of effects are caused by 20% of the causes. In marketing, this refers to 80% of your profits coming from 20% of your customers. This principle only serves to emphasize the importance of nurturing customer relationships using EI. Listening to your client’s needs and wants as well as empathizing with their struggles will ensure you will retain their business going into the future.Retaining customers is also cost effective. Studies have shown it costs five times more to attract a new customer than it does to keep an existing one, and only 13% of firms place on emphasis on acquisition versus customer retention. Utilizing EI in your strategy costs you nothing (beyond paying your emotionally intelligent team members more), and drastically improves the consumer’s Customer Experience.**Branding with Emotional Intelligence**One of the most powerful tools brands use is the ability to develop an emotional connection with their audience, and this can only be done with a high degree of emotional intelligence. As Douglas Van Praet, author of Unconscious Branding: How Neuroscience Can Empower (and Inspire) Marketing wrote, “The most startling truth is we don’t even think our way to logical solutions. We feel our way to reason. Emotions are the substrate, the base layer of neural circuitry underpinning even rational deliberation. Emotions don’t hinder decisions. They constitute the foundation on which they’re made!”This quote illustrates one of the critical components of consumer buying behaviour  People buy with their emotions, and brands know it. Their ultimate goal when marketing is to generate a positive brand image in the mind of the consumer. This is done through marketing campaigns using various advertising platforms. If one were to take a look at the most successful marketing campaigns from each year, it would be clear that high-performing strategies are the ones which use EI efficiently. Developing emotional advertisements and storytelling are two of the most crucial strategies in brand development.**Branding through Emotional Advertisements:**A study conducted by the University of Glasgow suggests humans have only four base emotions:* Happy* Sad* Afraid/Surprised* Angry/DisgustedIf we take a look at some of the most viewed advertisements over the last several years, there is a clear trend of companies trying to align their brand with at least one of these emotions. While it might seem obvious a brand wants to be seen as “happy,” this is not always the case. Clever EI used by marketers has allowed for the creation of some wide-appealing and effective advertisements.**“Sadvertising”**“Sadvertising” is a trend where brands create emotional ads which tug on the heartstrings of viewers. By implementing EI, these ads create a positive impression in the mind of consumers by humanizing the brand. In the President’s Choice advertisement we can see how what starts out as a bleak, somewhat depressing scene, eventually turns into a happy, loving affair. This transformation takes the viewer on a journey where a negative experience is avoided and is resolved positively which resonates well with audiences.**“Angratizing”**Ok, full confession, I made this word up. But it fits! Invoking outrage from your target audience may not be a conventional style of advertising, yet when done properly it can be incredibly efficient. Let’s look at Audi’s Super Bowl commercial from this year:Audi addresses the gender pay gap in this advertisement, trying to invoke anger from the viewer at this inequality. By the end of the ad, however, Audi brings it back to offer an optimistic vision of the future.As you can see from these examples, using emotions other than “happy” is advantageous in branding, but it is important to always bring the message back to an uplifting note. Brands do not want the last emotion their audience feels after watching a commercial to be a negative one, as this will lend itself to negative brand perception. It could even become a customer subconsciously opting for a competitor because they witnessed a sad brand advertisement that left them with a sad feeling. This underlines why emotional intelligence is so important in branding. If you are aware of what will emotionally resonate with your target audience, you will be able to use it to your brand’s advantage.**Brands Tell a Story**Storytelling is another emotionally intelligent strategy that brands use to interact with their audience. Essentially, brand storytelling is the process by which a brand takes a consumer on a complete journey with the end goal being a customer-brand connection. There are many different ways in which brands use EI for storytelling purposes, and we’ve written about it at length previously. Let’s look at a few emotionally intelligent brand storytelling examples.**Nike**Nike was the first to utilize the power of storytelling with their 1999 Michael Jordan Retirement commercial. The minute-long commercial shows various clips of Jordan’s career and ends with a picture of a young Michael Jordan with the Nike Swoosh in the bottom right corner.Instead of trying to sell a product, Nike sells the story of a man who went on to become a superstar. Nike’s brand, like in the commercial, is just an accessory to the story. By using the Self-Awareness pillar of EI, Nike puts themselves on the sidelines as their ads serve as the platform to tell athletic stories. The level of self-identification caused by the ad is a remarkable study in EI brand storytelling. Indeed, Nike has stuck with this strategy of having their brand take a backseat to the story, and it has paid off. Currently, Nike holds a larger share of the world’s shoe market (20%) than any other brand.**Airbnb**Airbnb revolutionized the hospitality industry, and it is also revolutionizing brand storytelling. Their content is focused solely on homeowners and the Airbnb customers who rent from them. The “stories” page is exactly what it sounds like  a place where users can document their adventures while using the service. These stories typically feature a small blog as well as videos produced by the Airbnb team.Similar to Nike’s approach, Airbnb allows the stories of these individuals to take centre stage while their logo sits off to the side somewhere. Airbnb uses EI to pick and choose which stories it wants to showcase. For obvious reasons only welcoming, friendly homeowners are shown, and they typically have a passion for meeting others. This lends a “welcoming” persona to the Airbnb brand.**EI in regards to interacting with team members**Being able to be emotionally intelligent with your clients and brand is a critical component of marketing. However, one of the most fundamentally crucial aspects of marketing is working together with your team as one cohesive unit. If there is a disconnect amongst your staff, then it will be next to impossible to do any effective marketing or be productive, at the least.Why is it so important to use EI with your coworkers? Your marketing team is the people that you see every day during the week, and if you aren’t getting along, then your best work is simply not getting done. By being self-aware, self-regulating, being empathetic and motivated, you will be able to operate harmoniously in a synergistic marketing environment.;

First off, be very skeptical of the accuracy of this model. It was designed exclusively by two theology professors with very little outside input. They also hand-picked the 15 factors that they thought would be important which is a fucking *terrible* way to design models. If those assumptions are wrong (and you have no way to tell if they are) then the models generated will be meaningless.Finally, this is not in any sense ""big data."" I'm not even sure if it's ""data"", there's no information about where they get their data from. At one point they talk about using the number of charismatic individuals capable of starting a religion at some point in history (*how do they know that number?!*) but they never list a source or method of calculation. Basically, two theology professors wrote a computer model that, intentionally or not, does nothing but model their assumptions. Calling it a ""big data model"" makes it sound impressive and sophisticated, but in this context it's entirely meaningless. #Dr. Hari Seldon's model contradicts this one.#> so says the Pew Research Religious Landscape Study, which in 2015 found that almost a quarter of Americans profess no religious affiliation. You poor, ignorant bastards.#I wholeheartedly agree with your skepticism. You are certainly right about the vague and arbitrary nature of the model, and I would be reluctant to take their findings as particularly meaningful considering this fact. The author only briefly mentions that the model is ""based on computer models that incorporate anthropological, archeological, psychological, and modern demographic data,"" which could literally be anything, especially data from models that would already fit within the parameters of their assumptions. I really don't think we could truly ever accurately predict (or explain) something as complex as the development of religion throughout history, especially by using data from scientific fields where we still only have a cursory understanding of something we are trying to use to explain something else (such as our fledgling understanding of how belief systems are rooted in our psychology and neurology, usually incomplete or misleading archaeological records, etc.) "

I'm well versed in Excel and Google sheets just short of writing macros myself.  I'm also *okay* with SQL when pulling data but haven't any experience yet in overwriting data in DB (think pulls with JOINs).  I know just enough SQL to know what to search for on the internet to figure out how to get something done.  Other than that, I have a rudimentary knowledge of Python, HTML, and CSS.  To put it shortly, I've dabbled in a lot of things and want to lock down something for a long lasting career.This brings me to my question of what would /r/careerguidance do if they were in my shoes.  The reason why I've narrowed my prospects down to these three choices are as follows:* 1. Front-end web dev: Job market for this position is relatively high and although the learning curve is steep, I think I have potential to do pick this up fairly quickly.* 2. Analyst: While job searching for positions related to data and in the tech field short of engineering, I found that my current duties as an Ops Manager is geared more towards analytics (pulling metrics on operations) than actual day-to-day and roadmapping of operations.* 3. QA: This role is similar to the Analyst position (finding multiple bugs with new deployments then testing but never looking under the hood).* 4. IT: This is kind of a dark-horse candidate mainly because the industry, from my research, is more laid-out in the sense that the likelihood of certification X will land you in position Y is fairly high.Thanks!;"I've been in IT for a decade. I would just implore you to research diligently before giving it much consideration. The job market in IT is shrinking due to migration to cloud and automation  a few years ago I could find 30-40 IT jobs in my area at any given time and now I'm lucky to see one or two at any given time, when they do come up they're strictly end user support gigs.I think that IT is a good gig to have right now if you can find a job, and maybe for the next ten years or so, but I definitely wouldn't expect it to be something going strong in 20 years or so. The certification thing isn't, unfortunately, as clear as it seems. Many within the IT field despise certifications, and this extends to hiring managers many times. It can help, but the big thing is experience more than certifications. For anything but end user support: Employers, due to the dwindling job market, are looking for candidates who can demonstrate subject matter expertise across a variety of technologies, (Virtualization, Cloud, Networking, Server, DB, etc). I guess the thing that I really want to impress upon you, in my attempt to be helpful, is that IT (like programming) isn't the way that it used to be, and the problem is that a lot of information on the internet is outdated. The data for today won't make it to the internet for a few years and by then it'll be outdated too. You used to be able to pull down a decent salary just being a Windows guy, or a Linux guy, but now to even be competitive for bad jobs you have got to know a lot about everything and it helps to have a mastery of something. In addition, these jobs often require that you have 24x7x365 availability and you typically have to abandon hopes of things like career advancement and pay increases. #Thanks for the lengthy response.  Good to know that as an outsider coming in, IT isn't as ""easy"" or straightforward as I had imagined.  I remember reading/hearing that Cloud networking was going to take over everything else which what got me interested in the first place.  Looks like it's going to be dev, QA, or analyst for me then."

These will be consumed by services like AWS Kinesis or Azure Stream Analytics.Anybody knows a large dataset for this use case I could use? Otherwise, I would just produce them randomly via code, but it would not be the prefered solution;Hi Weckla, I see that you asked this question but never got a response.

AskAnthropology;5wsb1s;1488333737.0;/r/AskAnthropology/comments/5wsb1s/digital_anthropology_masters/;Digital Anthropology Masters;Hi everyone, so I just graduated with an anthropology degree and I am now looking for a masters program that I am interested in. It's been my dream to be able to combine technology with anthropology. Sadly during my 4 years in college, I was not able to take any courses relating to technology and anthropology. I saw a masters program at the University of Kent called Computing and Social Anthropology. I was wondering if there was anyone who has attended this master program or anyone who knows a thing or two about it.Secondly, i would love some help about any masters on a subject like digital anthropology or a digital anthropology its self. For me, as a person who literally has no idea on what to study except for a broad concept of combining my two passions, I want to somehow to be in both the technological field and the human field. For a long time, i thought about getting into Big Data, which is now becoming very popular. I would love to hear about some ideas you might have, some masters program or Ph.D. suggestions and general help on what to do with my life :)Thanks a lot for any help you can give me...;"Sorry you're not getting any replies :/ Look into Victoria Bernal. She's published through UC Irvine, etc. she has some books, and if you have access to Jstor (or other places) you can find her essays. She focuses on digital cultures and Africa  specifically Ethiopia, and Eritrea. Eritrea during the 1900's had a revolution to separate from Ethiopia. They felt they were not getting governmental attention. This resulted in generations of war, and poverty. Sadly then, the new president became a dictator, and began to limit internet, communication, etc.Among other things she looks at how the internet is utilized by Eritreans in diaspora, and how a lot of Eritrean culture is tied to their message boards in a now restrictive country under authoritarian rule.Just a little hint at how you can utilize a focused on digital cultures in a way I had never thought to do.Edit: here's an [anthro source](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2005.32.4.660/abstract) Also, she's what comes up when you google her. The book that's about Eritrea is ""Nation as Network"".#You might consider getting a media studies degree instead. You can use ethnographic methods, use anthropologists as sources, but you might find more support for your work among people already having that conversation."

startups;5wk1n8;1488235571.0;/r/startups/comments/5wk1n8/emotionally_intelligent_marketing_for_smaller/;Emotionally Intelligent Marketing for Smaller Brands;**Emotional Intelligence in Marketing**The amount of information marketing professionals have at their disposal is unprecedented. These days, we can discover almost every aspect of a consumer’s lifestyle and buying habits, and use this information to influence their purchasing decisions. With this wealth of information for sales and marketing, marketers should be able to form deep connections with potential customers with ease, right?Unfortunately, in many cases creating strong relationships is difficult. Despite having incredibly detailed information on their prospective buyers, many brands fail to connect with consumers. In fact, only one in three consumers believe their favourite brands truly understands them and only 35% think the emails or messages they receive are providing relevant and useful content.So where does the disconnect arise? Why are brands failing to understand their audience with all the data about customer behaviour, the marketing funnel, and demographic segmentation? One of the most obvious reasons is that brands neglect to understand the power of Emotional Intelligence (EI). In this article, we flesh out three compelling reasons, showing the how and why sales and marketing often miss the mark, forgetting a fundamental aspect of messaging that provides greater impact, resonance, and meaning.**What is Emotional Intelligence?**Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to be intelligent about your emotions, as well as the emotions of others. Author, Dr. Daniel Goleman, describes EI as being comprised of five key components:* Self-Regulation* Empathy* Social Skills* Motivation* Self AwarenessEmotional intelligence is an intangible in each of us. It affects how we manage behavior, navigate social complexities, and make personal decisions that achieve positive results. Individuals with a high level of EI are incredibly valued in businesses  people who demonstrate high EI make $28,000 more annually (on average) than their counterparts with low EI.Unlike your IQ which is fixed, your EI is something flexible which can be improved through continuous self-betterment with some effort.Let us examine how we can leverage the benefits of EI regarding dealing with our prospects, clients and even members of our communications teams.**Emotional Intelligence With Potential Customers**Chances are, everyone reading this has been on the receiving end of “spam”. If by some miracle you are unaware of the term, spam refers to unsolicited messages repeatedly sent to large groups of people, typically for the purpose of advertising. These messages usually have little or no relevance to the individual on the receiving end, making spam an annoyance to all, including the economy. In fact, it is estimated that spam emails cost businesses more than $20 billion per year.Then came the emergence of Big Data. Marketers were suddenly able to identify their target market’s interests, passions, buying preferences and so much more. It should have put an end to spam messaging. Digital messaging is slowly returning to its terrible roots. Due to poor practices by marketing professionals, more and more emails are being marked as spam and failing to reach prospects. There are some obvious reasons as to why this is occurring.**A) Listening Skills**A common mistake being made by marketers is their failure to hear. For example, a brand may have identified their target market and then quickly developed what they believe to be a perfect message to their recipient. But the marketing team did not pay attention to what their demographic was saying on social media platforms, for instance. It turns out their email marketing message completely misses the mark, and most of their prospects didn’t even open the email.To avoid this classic mistake, professional communications can benefit from Emotional Intelligence, particularly the pillars of Empathy and Social Skills. If this marketing team had paid attention to what their target audience was saying on social media channels before developing a message, they would have been able to understand the needs and wants of their prospects better.**B) Consent and Regulation**Another mistake often made when trying to attract potential clients is a tendency to abuse freely available data. It is worth remembering that when members of your target audience have no previous interaction with your brand, yet you go out of the way to get personal information on them, such as their email, the intent to solicit lacks consent. In other words, purchasing lists would be an example of this kind of behaviour, as would accessing their email off of an unrelated database. If you have access to the contact information of an individual and it feels wrong, chances are it is a bad choice.To avoid situations like this, marketers must remember the EI pillars of being self-aware and self-regulation. If you are not generating the leads you need, then perhaps it is time to rethink your brand’s marketing strategy. Instead of cold-emailing unqualified leads, try to introduce context. Imagine you work for a company that sells fancy cakes. One of your lead generation strategies is to send emails to people who visit a popular designer pastry website. The emails that you send are personalized and friendly and also include a recipe for a cake. As well, the email contains invitations to visit the website to learn more.In the example above, the people being emailed are already somewhat qualified (interested in high-quality pastries), so the email sent would not be cold and received with hostility. Your brand also offers the recipient value in the form of a free recipe which begins to establish a positive brand reputation as soon as the email is opened. Finally, the email includes an invitation to your brand’s website. This is your call to action, and it is the action that you want the recipient to take from the email.**C) The Pareto Principle**Emotional intelligence is used for far more than just digital targeting. Once you have attracted, a client is when EI arguably becomes the most useful. I am sure many of you have heard of the Pareto Principle – the theory that 80% of effects are caused by 20% of the causes. In marketing, this refers to 80% of your profits coming from 20% of your customers. This principle only serves to emphasize the importance of nurturing customer relationships using EI. Listening to your client’s needs and wants as well as empathizing with their struggles will ensure you will retain their business going into the future.Retaining customers is also cost effective. Studies have shown it costs five times more to attract a new customer than it does to keep an existing one, and only 13% of firms place on emphasis on acquisition versus customer retention. Utilizing EI in your strategy costs you nothing (beyond paying your emotionally intelligent team members more), and drastically improves the consumer’s Customer Experience.**Branding with Emotional Intelligence**One of the most powerful tools brands use is the ability to develop an emotional connection with their audience, and this can only be done with a high degree of emotional intelligence. As Douglas Van Praet, author of Unconscious Branding: How Neuroscience Can Empower (and Inspire) Marketing wrote, “The most startling truth is we don’t even think our way to logical solutions. We feel our way to reason. Emotions are the substrate, the base layer of neural circuitry underpinning even rational deliberation. Emotions don’t hinder decisions. They constitute the foundation on which they’re made!”This quote illustrates one of the critical components of consumer buying behaviour  People buy with their emotions, and brands know it. Their ultimate goal when marketing is to generate a positive brand image in the mind of the consumer. This is done through marketing campaigns using various advertising platforms. If one were to take a look at the most successful marketing campaigns from each year, it would be clear that high-performing strategies are the ones which use EI efficiently. Developing emotional advertisements and storytelling are two of the most crucial strategies in brand development.**Branding through Emotional Advertisements:**A study conducted by the University of Glasgow suggests humans have only four base emotions:* Happy* Sad* Afraid/Surprised* Angry/DisgustedIf we take a look at some of the most viewed advertisements over the last several years, there is a clear trend of companies trying to align their brand with at least one of these emotions. While it might seem obvious a brand wants to be seen as “happy,” this is not always the case. Clever EI used by marketers has allowed for the creation of some wide-appealing and effective advertisements.***“Sadvertising”***“Sadvertising” is a trend where brands create emotional ads which tug on the heartstrings of viewers. By implementing EI, these ads create a positive impression in the mind of consumers by humanizing the brand. In the President’s Choice advertisement we can see how what starts out as a bleak, somewhat depressing scene, eventually turns into a happy, loving affair. This transformation takes the viewer on a journey where a negative experience is avoided and is resolved positively which resonates well with audiences.*“Angratizing”*Ok, full confession, I made this word up. But it fits! Invoking outrage from your target audience may not be a conventional style of advertising, yet when done properly it can be incredibly efficient. Let’s look at Audi’s Super Bowl commercial from this year:Audi addresses the gender pay gap in this advertisement, trying to invoke anger from the viewer at this inequality. By the end of the ad, however, Audi brings it back to offer an optimistic vision of the future.As you can see from these examples, using emotions other than “happy” is advantageous in branding, but it is important to always bring the message back to an uplifting note. Brands do not want the last emotion their audience feels after watching a commercial to be a negative one, as this will lend itself to negative brand perception. It could even become a customer subconsciously opting for a competitor because they witnessed a sad brand advertisement that left them with a sad feeling. This underlines why emotional intelligence is so important in branding. If you are aware of what will emotionally resonate with your target audience, you will be able to use it to your brand’s advantage.**Brands Tell a Story**Storytelling is another emotionally intelligent strategy that brands use to interact with their audience. Essentially, brand storytelling is the process by which a brand takes a consumer on a complete journey with the end goal being a customer-brand connection. There are many different ways in which brands use EI for storytelling purposes, and we’ve written about it at length previously. Let’s look at a few emotionally intelligent brand storytelling examples.**Nike**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZSYD5OYSqc Nike was the first to utilize the power of storytelling with their 1999 Michael Jordan Retirement commercial. The minute-long commercial shows various clips of Jordan’s career and ends with a picture of a young Michael Jordan with the Nike Swoosh in the bottom right corner.Instead of trying to sell a product, Nike sells the story of a man who went on to become a superstar. Nike’s brand, like in the commercial, is just an accessory to the story. By using the Self-Awareness pillar of EI, Nike puts themselves on the sidelines as their ads serve as the platform to tell athletic stories. The level of self-identification caused by the ad is a remarkable study in EI brand storytelling. Indeed, Nike has stuck with this strategy of having their brand take a backseat to the story, and it has paid off. Currently, Nike holds a larger share of the world’s shoe market (20%) than any other brand.**Airbnb**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p884fFQL80Airbnb revolutionized the hospitality industry, and it is also revolutionizing brand storytelling. Their content is focused solely on homeowners and the Airbnb customers who rent from them. The “stories” page is exactly what it sounds like  a place where users can document their adventures while using the service. These stories typically feature a small blog as well as videos produced by the Airbnb team.Similar to Nike’s approach, Airbnb allows the stories of these individuals to take centre stage while their logo sits off to the side somewhere. Airbnb uses EI to pick and choose which stories it wants to showcase. For obvious reasons only welcoming, friendly homeowners are shown, and they typically have a passion for meeting others. This lends a “welcoming” persona to the Airbnb brand.EI in regards to interacting with team membersBeing able to be emotionally intelligent with your clients and brand is a critical component of marketing. However, one of the most fundamentally crucial aspects of marketing is working together with your team as one cohesive unit. If there is a disconnect amongst your staff, then it will be next to impossible to do any effective marketing or be productive, at the least.Why is it so important to use EI with your coworkers? Your marketing team is the people that you see every day during the week, and if you aren’t getting along, then your best work is simply not getting done. By being self-aware, self-regulating, being empathetic and motivated, you will be able to operate harmoniously in a synergistic marketing environment.If you like this article, read more here at https://www.photonicpr.com/emotional-intelligence-marketing/#.WLSolvkrJPZ Thanks for reading!;I think Spiritual Intelligence is by far the highest form of intelligence. I would put Emotional Intelligence second.

Need your opinion;"Let me share one quick winning from Yesterday, I saw a millennial going past my kiosk with ""DC Legends Comic book"" in his hand. I stopped him and started the conversation around the theme that our subscription TV service has tons of DC comics programs e.g. ""DC Legends of Tomorrow"", ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D"" etc. This teenager never had Pay TV, nor was he aware that we show these kinds of programs. His perception was shaped by his immediate family that Subscription TV means only sports and it’s always too expensive. Following were key attributes of that teenager:1. He is a gamer.2. Loves comic series.3. Hates sports.4. Live most of his life on Facebook and other social media.Upon further discovery, I found that he is totally madly and deeply in love with ""12 Monkeys - The movie by Bruce Willis"", so I immediately recommended him 12 monkey TV series and signed him up for Unlimited Broadband and Platinum HD.Following were key learnings for me:1. He rarely comes to the shopping center.2. Purchase most of the stuff even groceries online.3. Spend most of his time online.4. He never had Subscription TV however his perception was shaped negatively by his immediate surrounding.5. The process of stopping, discovery, recommendation etc. took more than an hour.6. I was lucky that I spotted him and manage to sign him up.The whole point which I am trying to make here is that right now our approach is ""Reactionary"", we are waiting for the potential customers to come to us so that we can serve them better or in more efficient manner however we are missing out a huge opportunity as Facebook has 15 Million Plus active users in Australia i.e. 63% of Population (http://www.socialmedianews.com.au/social-media-statistics-australia-january-2016/) and we need to devise a way to connect to these potential customers.""Big data analytics"" is the future, the whole notion of changing the perception of Subscription TV is meaningless unless we tailor our product to each and every customer (or potential customers). Remember WIIFM (What in it for me) principle still holds true however we are taking it to bigger scale (If every member of a household is finding something relevant out of Pay TV or any product then it will help the company in winning their business).Sales 2.0 unify a new culture of selling with optimized processes and next generation technology and it has revolutionized the way sales organizations benchmark and elevate sales performance. Turning sales from an ""Enigmatic"" art to a ""Precision"" and dramatically increasing revenue at a lower cost.Best in class sales organizations are already deploying sales 2.0 best practices to dramatically improve performance. They are focusing on the following metrics.    Increasing LTV (Lifetime value)    Decreasing CAC (Customer acquisition cost)    Increasing Volume    Increasing Velocity    Increasing predictability    Increasing scalabilityAs the traditional sales model crumbles, becomes untenably expensive, slow and unpredictable, it’s now essential that every sales organization adopt sales 2.0 and relentlessly focus on these 6 Essential metrics to remain competitive.";"This isn't sales 2.0, what you are referring to is called marketing.#Every one have different definition e.g. Sales 2.0 is a more efficient and effective way of selling for the buyer and the seller enabled through technology.” – Anneke Seley.Sales 2.0 is about sales people using Web 2.0 tools and social media to sell more effectively.Pamela Vaughan It's all about changing the perception from traditional ""interruption"" based model to ""helping the buyer in decision making"".

We can work in teams or on our own.- Does it look better if I do it all myself, or work on a team? Am I overthinking this?;"Hey, good for you for thinking ahead! I'd say it would be better to work on a team, both for your project now and for your future resume. In a work setting you probably won't have to ""do it all"" but will be party of a team whose members all have various strengths and weaknesses. Employers want to know that you work well with others and can contribute something to a work product. Join the team and just try to be in charge of the part of the project that interests you most. Do you want to be the quant analysis person at your future job? Them do the analysis in this project. Want to be the go-to viz guy at the office? Then work on the viz part of the project. "

Get your foot in the door and then prove that your other skills are legitimate and that you are hungry to learn more and be given more responsibility.Ideally I would look for a company with less than 200 employees.You have plenty of time - experience will come! Once you are a couple years in you'll be able to flesh your resume out a bit more.That being said I'd organize your resume as follow:* Objective* Experience* Skills* EducationThe content won't matter all that much at this time - just try and focus on more technical aspects and work your connections for an interview. Good luck!#We'd suggest removing the objective altogether and replacing it with a professional summary. Objectives are generally out of date on resumes now, as hiring managers can already surmise that you're looking for a position in their field. The summary is a much better route, because it gives you the space to provide potential employers with a rapid-fire explanation of who you are, what you do, and how well you do it. You can even tailor it to specific job listings, including specializations that align with the requirements they've posted for their position. Your coursework section takes up a fairly large amount of space, which is why we're normally not inclined to include these types of sections, but given that you're an entry level college graduate, I can understand why you made this call. Our advice would be to reformat this so that it takes up less space, which will give you room to include an academic project section. This section will go a much longer way in helping you find a job or internships because rather than just listing coursework as an abstract list that you completed, you actually demonstrate your proficiency via academic projects because they provide an avenue for you to demonstrate your abilities through concrete actions. While I realize that some of your work history probably isn't overly relevant to what you're looking to do now, it is absolutely unacceptable not to use bullet points. You want to open up each line with a hard past-tense verb, such as ""Managed"" ""Oversaw"" or in this case ""Conducted repairs"", and quantify your actions with hard numbers as much as possible."

I have a few general questions about what to expect upon graduation, and thought I'd see what you all had to say. Before I dive into those, I will roughly breakdown what we focused on in this program:3-4 classes where we focused on R. We learned several ways to to analyze data within R and talked about ways of integrating pertinent statistics to conduct the analysis.2 classes where we focused on SQL-- one was almost exclusively done in MySQL and the other was more of a big data class, where we learned about unstructured data (Hadoop).Several Marketing Analytics classes where we would look at predicting things like churn, probability of purchase, etc. We used tools like Google Analytics, SPSS, etc.There were a few other classes that were, more or less, a combination of the aforementioned classes. I have 3 years of work experience prior to joining this program, where I did IT work as well as Operations work. I did analytics (more descriptive than predictive) in the Operations roles and worked on a wide variety of things in IT (queries, hardware, analytics, etc.) My questions: What would one reasonably expect to earn upon completion of this masters? I've done some research, and it's far from conclusive, but the best number I can seem to come up with is an average of $69,000 (so I've been using this as my benchmark). I have an offer on the table for roughly $62,000. I'm also currently in an internship, but have yet to have a discussion with managers regarding potential employment upon graduation. I really like this company-- should I tell them I have an offer on the table and that, while I understand they may not be able to make an offer right now, I need to get some sort of understanding of what my outlook with them is?This may be the wrong place to post this (if so, any suggestions for a more relevant sub would be appreciated). If there is any more information I can provide to clarify, please, let me know.Thanks CS Career Community! ;What is the city?

The second interview's mail mentions - We will do a deep dive on these topics: Data Structures and Algorithms, Databases, Problem solving/Troubleshooting, Unix/Linux and networking basics as needed.As a normal cs student, I know the sources for first two, but I need some resources on how to prepare for the rest of these topics. I googled and most of the interview experiences state questions related to system administration and scalability that I have zero experience about. How can I prepare?  Would appreciate any inputs that you guys have. Also, asking question on reddit for the first time, let me know if I made some mistake or should be posting it to some other community. Thanks a lot!

forhire;5z5hrj;1489417745.0;/r/forhire/comments/5z5hrj/hiring_nyc_1010data_is_hiring_a_c_developer/;[Hiring] (NYC) 1010data is hiring a C developer;"1010data is not a C shop, but we're looking for a C programmer.First, a bit about the company, and then more info about the tools we use. 1010data is a ""big data analytics platform"". We're a medium sized (~250 person) company based in NYC and have been around since 2000. I like to explain our product in the following way… Imagine Microsoft Excel (a tabular spreadsheet view of data). Put that in a web browser so we have something similar to Google Sheets. Now take 100 billion - 1 trillion rows of data, put them in a single spreadsheet, and maintain the ability to manipulate that data in real time. You can create new columns that are a function of other columns, filter and aggregate the data, run more advanced statistical analyses, visualize the data, or build a data driven web application. That's the Trillion Row Spreadsheet and it's the core product that the rest of our business is built around. Most of our server side code is written in k, which is a pretty cool language that I'm not going to discuss at length. k is an excellent tool for vector processing and distributed computing, but there are some tasks it's not well suited for, and that's where this job post becomes relevant. The Core Group at 1010data (the devs that build the product described above) includes the ""Interfacing Team"" which is responsible for two things. First, we solve the problems that k isn't well suited for. This consists of implementing some of the very high performance bits of the system that don't vectorize well, as well as integrating third party tools as to avoid reinvention of the wheel (we didn't feel the need to implement AES in k). Second, we build the code distributed to customers (k is interpreted, we generally don't like to distribute the interpreter). This code is (again) very performance sensitive, but also must be very portable (we've targeted Windows, Linux, OSX, AIX, and HP-UX to name a few targets). Put most simply, the Interfacing Team is responsible for the code that isn't written in k or JavaScript (though we do in fact do some k programming).So what are we looking for? We want someone with C/C++/other-manually-memory-managed-language programming experience who is interested in building high performance tools and libraries for manipulating big data. Generally we look favorably on people with STEM degrees, though there is some preference for people with a computer science background (you're going to be asked algorithm questions and for Big-O analyses during the interview process).  We have positions open at the entry level, though we certainly won't turn away those with deeper experience.If you're interested you can reach out to me directly, or apply via our [careers page](https://www.1010data.com/company/careers/open-positions/position/?id=599812). I am the hiring manager for the team (so I won't get any sort of bonus for applications through that link) but reaching out to me directly can skip some of the recruiting rigmarole. Note that this position is on-site so you'd have to live in or at least within a reasonable distance of New York City.";

techsupport;5yirn3;1489104019.0;/r/techsupport/comments/5yirn3/hard_drives_not_correctly_recognized_in_dell/;Hard Drives not correctly recognized in Dell 790MT Tower;"Hi guys, I purchased a Dell 790MT tower earlier this year to use as a cheap file server. The plan: 2x3TB HDD's in RAID 1 for data protection, 2x500GB HDD's in hot swap cages to move data quickly if necessary, and a 120gb SSD boot drive. I also purchased a cheap raid card just to get some more SATA ports (specifically this guy http://www.ebay.com/itm/161225040708?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT).So here's what I did:1. Install SSD and raid card, SSD is is connected to Mobo, install windows and set up services. 2. Install RAID drives and setup software RAID in Windows3. Install Hot swap cages and drivesThis started are really well. The system correctly recognized the RAM and SSD that I had put in and imaged perfectly. I did Windows Updates and updated drivers and the BIOS from Dell Command with no issues. The system with just an SSD works perfectly. Step 2 is where I ran into my issue. I initially installed my two big data drives on the motherboard because I was going to use software RAID instead of hardware RAID. After installing them and booting to the BIOS I noticed that the there were three hard drives listed in boot devices, but all three of them listed the same exact data drive. Both of the 3tb drives are the same but the serials should be slightly different, and the SSD didn't even show up. When I tried to boot, I kept getting a ""No boot device found"" error. If I try to boot from a device manually instead of relying on the boot devices in the BIOS, I can usually boot to Windows (80%+ success rate). I've tried removing the RAID card, and using the two smaller drives but that shows the same issue. I've tried a lot of other combinations of hardware like just using the RAID card and only using one data drive, but it seems like this system is just really picky. The RAID card seems to work perfectly, when I plug drives into it I can see each one in the card's software and setup RAID that way however I still get the same boot problem. Currently the BIOS is setup in legacy boot but I haven't tried to setup the system with UEFI because I don't think that will solve the issue. This is extremely confusing for me because I have done a lot of tech support in the past so I know how to thoroughly troubleshoot a system and this just doesn't make any sense because I can't figure out if this is a hardware issue or a software issue. Is anyone aware of a software/hardware issue with this desktop or has anyone seen this problem and been able to resolve it? In addition if you have any ideas I'd be more than happy to try them. It just gets annoying when I can't restart my computer when I'm not right in front of it.Thanks all! ";Is there a setting in the BIOS for boot order? You want to be sure that the raid card isn't the boot device#There are settings for a boot order and the raid card is not listed. If I drives installed on the RAID card then those show up, but nothing indicates that they aren't connected directly to the motherboard. I have attempted to only have the SSD listed in the boot order but that gives me the same error.

I don't need anything fancy but would it make sense to buy one with Wifi, instead of the stand alone? Also, would it make sense to buy one which is capable of overclocking (what is the price difference?) so that in case I do need more power at some point I can swap the CPU and cooler and am good to go? ";"1.) i5 + 480 is one of the best combo's out there. Everything looks to be compatible and you haven't made the same motherboard mistake that I see time and time again with Kabylake.2.) PSU is underpowered. As is, you're at 75% load, which is just on the edge of red. It'll work, but your PSU won't last as long(and by that, I mean as long as it normally should. It'll burn out a bit faster, but still last a few years). Getting a 550w would be better, but a 600-650w would be perfect. For the same price, you can get a semi-modular CXm 750w, which, while ""officially"" Tier IV, would probably be closer to Tier III or maybe even Tier II, just like the Seasonic. 3.) You're going to struggle no matter what with the case when building (they pretty much all have at least 1 tricky thing about them). That being said, it's going to be infinitely easier to build in a mid-tower case than it is to build in an mATX mini-tower.4.) Motherboard is good, you seem to be one of the few people who actually picked the right motherboard for a Kabylake CPU (250 or 270) The wifi thing is up to you, a card will probably be just as good, if not, better than onboard unless your willing to spend a decent amount on a mobo. Cheapest compatible mobo I found with onboard wifi is €121.38...you're paying €100 for essentially the same thing. With overclocking, the Z270 is more expensive than a 250  the same goes for the locked vs unlocked CPU's. The i5 is weird in that it's good to have overclock potential since you could encounter things that it may struggle with...you probably won't find much that a locked i7-7700 can't tackle, but the same can't be said for an i5. For a light overclock, you will end up spending money on an aftermarket cooler (either the 212 Evo or the H7, preferable the H7, but I'm not sure if it's available in Germany. Heavier overclocks require better, more expensive coolers), so by the end, you're probably looking at another €100 or so to tack onto your build for overclocking.#Awesome, thanks for the heads up concerning the PSU! See the list below with the PSU update. I think I will then leave the mobo/wifi/CPU as it is, I probably won't touch the system for the next 2-3 years so by then I might want to change more than just the CPU anyway.

I'm well versed in Excel and Google sheets just short of writing macros myself.  I'm also *okay* with SQL when pulling data but haven't any experience yet in overwriting data in DB (think pulls with JOINs).  I know just enough SQL to know what to search for on the internet to figure out how to get something done.  Other than that, I have a rudimentary knowledge of Python, HTML, and CSS.  To put it shortly, I've dabbled in a lot of things and want to lock down something for a long lasting career.This brings me to my question of what would /r/careeradvice do if they were in my shoes.  The reason why I've narrowed my prospects down to these three choices are as follows:* 1. Front-end web dev: Job market for this position is relatively high and although the learning curve is steep, I think I have potential to do pick this up fairly quickly.* 2. Analyst: While job searching for positions related to data and in the tech field short of engineering, I found that my current duties as an Ops Manager is geared more towards analytics (pulling metrics on operations) than actual day-to-day and roadmapping of operations.* 3. QA: This role is similar to the Analyst position (finding multiple bugs with new deployments then testing but never looking under the hood).* 4. IT: This is kind of a dark-horse candidate mainly because the industry, from my research, is more laid-out in the sense that the likelihood of certification X will land you in position Y is fairly high.Thanks!;

We're a medium sized (~250 person) company located in midtown east (46th & 3rd) and have been around since 2000. I like to explain our product in the following way… Imagine Microsoft Excel (a tabular spreadsheet view of data). Put that in a web browser so we have something similar to Google Sheets. Now take 100 billion - 1 trillion rows of data, put them in a single spreadsheet, and maintain the ability to manipulate that data in real time. You can create new columns that are a function of other columns, filter and aggregate the data, run more advanced statistical analyses, visualize the data, or build a data driven web application. That's the Trillion Row Spreadsheet and it's the core product that the rest of our business is built around.Most of our server side code is written in k, which is a pretty cool language that I'm not going to discuss at length. k is an excellent tool for vector processing and distributed computing, but there are some tasks it's not well suited for, and that's where this job post becomes relevant. The Core Group at 1010data (the devs that build the product described above) includes the ""Interfacing Team"" which is responsible for two things. First, we solve the problems that k isn't well suited for. This consists of implementing some of the very high performance bits of the system that don't vectorize well, as well as integrating third party tools as to avoid reinvention of the wheel (we didn't feel the need to implement AES in k). Second, we build the code distributed to customers (k is interpreted, we generally don't like to distribute the interpreter). This code is (again) very performance sensitive, but also must be very portable (we've targeted Windows, Linux, OSX, AIX, and HP-UX to name a few targets). Put most simply, the Interfacing Team is responsible for the code that isn't written in k or JavaScript (though we do in fact do some k programming).So what are we looking for? We want someone with C/C++/other-manually-memory-managed-language programming experience who is interested in building high performance tools and libraries for manipulating big data. Generally we look favorably on people with STEM degrees, though there is some preference for people with a computer science background (you're going to be asked algorithm questions and for Big-O analyses during the interview process).  We have positions open at the entry level, though we certainly won't turn away those with deeper experience.If you're interested you can reach out to me directly, or apply via our [careers page](https://www.1010data.com/company/careers/open-positions/position/?id=599812). I am the hiring manager for the team (so I won't get any sort of bonus for applications through that link) but reaching out to me directly can skip some of the recruiting rigmarole.";[deleted]#Glad to hear you're interested!

Incidentally, these concepts have been taught in global elite b-schools for decades. So, how come Analytics, which has been there in practice for decades experience a meteoric rise suddenly? To answer this question, we need to get the Big Picture. Given below are key factors that led to huge buzz around analytics today.•	Proliferation of Data Sources – Every day we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. This comes from digital footprints left on social media platforms, IoT sensors, wearables, transactions to name a few. Interesting fact is that only 1% of data collected is ever analyzed. To put into perspective all that innovation and insights driven by analytics are from analyzing just 1% of the data collected globally.•	Change in Customers’ expectations – Today connected customers expect personalized service on-demand based on their digital journey and personal preferences anytime, anywhere and on any device. Google’s context-aware search engine results, AI powered personal assistants from Google and Apple, Amazon’s recommendation engine have all made today’s unforgiving connected customers to expect the same level of customer experience from all brands they interact with.•	“Race to Zero” by Cloud Computing giants – The cloud computing price war between Amazon’s AWS, Google and Microsoft dubbed “race to zero” is well known. By late 2016, AWS has already made 52 price reductions and more price cuts are expected. •	Advent of Hadoop – Hadoop, open source distributed filesystem with framework for data analysis and transformation with high fault tolerance and reliability has broken barriers to entry for start-ups and significant cost reductions for enterprises like Yahoo Inc., whose Hadoop clusters span 40,000 servers. •	Every company is a technology company – Today every company is a technology company. One prominent example is how Domino’s is turning more into a digital e-commerce player from a traditional quick service restaurant through its Domino’s AnyWare program. As part of the program Domino’s collects data from 85,000 different customer touchpoints, to derive insights and drive growth. As a result, Domino’s was able to process about 55% of its orders online.•	Urge to join the ‘Big Data Analytics’ bandwagon – Media is inundated with Analysts reports with impressive projected and actual CAGR of Big Data Analytics investment, and reports on how data-driven insights helped enterprises solve real-life business problems and drive growth. This has pushed Top Management of many Enterprises to jump the Big Data Analytics bandwagon, before it’s too late.Open source distributed platform coupled with massively discounted storage & compute costs (cloud) have given Start-ups equal footing with Enterprises in developing and launching innovative products leveraging Big Data and Analytics, which was possible only by firms with deep pockets until few years ago. On the other hand, heightened customers’ expectations have led to the digital transformation of Enterprises that target to replace instincts-driven decisions with insights-driven decisions. Both trends driven by factors mentioned earlier have led to the explosive growth of Big Data Analytics witnessed today.About Us:At Noah Data, we help Start-ups, ISVs and Enterprises drive Digital Transformation.

I am planning on trying to do my best to convert the offer I select into a full-time position.(People don't seem to mention company names here..? is that a rule?) but here are the offers:---------------------------------------------------1. Card company that is everywhere you want to be - .NET Dev Intern for developing Authorize.NET apps2. Joint Venture between smallsoft and accent***. - Technical Consultant Intern (does both dev work and has exposure to new techs such as VR/AR/etc.)3. #BeMagenta telecommunications company - Big Data Analysis? (not sure, they said they have a clean slate... tons of data in the cloud, but don't know what to do with all this stuff so are hiring people to do things with it)---------------------------------------------------I definitely want to get my hands dirty and do a lot of coding myself, but I also want some exposure to a lot of the business aspects so that I can go up and above the dev team become a technical manager one day. Here are my questions:1. Which of the positions do you guys think will be the most helpful? 2. Has anyone interned at any of these companies before? If so, any information is welcome!3. If I don't end up getting a full-time position out of the internship, which would be the most helpful in the job search in the future?Thank you so much in advance, this sub has been tremendous in help during my effort to find an internship this year.EDIT: tbh, it's not actually a first job. I worked at a very popular korean electronics company as a web developer intern last summer as well.;I would take job #1.I think your internships in college should be as technical as possible - you can always pick up business skills later, and they are not necessary right out of school unless you want to go straight into PM. Consulting in general is a lot more integration work, which I don't think is as valuable as pure dev experience.In terms of the big data position - good big data projects don't start with no goal in sight. I personally am really wary of companies with the attitude you describe because it is the opposite of the goals-driven process you need to make big data useful. Also, you might end up just writing data pipelines/doing a lot of DB work.

I have a BE degree in Computer Science and Im fairly good at coding.So far being in the startup , I spent about 6 months doing some data analysis, random scripting on machine learning platform. Later from for about 4 months I worked on a .NET application(mainly GUI and testing) and finally I switched over to doing iOS applications. I love doing iOS applications and daily Im learning more and more(Swift is awesome!). However since Im leaving the company now, I want to join a bootcamp to clearly get my basics right in one field. Im torn between enrolling myself in a Big data Hadoop course or choose an iOS developer course. Big data , hadoop fascinates me and even though I have no experience I anticipate lot of challenges and learning to be done. Also the pay for a Big Data developer seems way more than a similarly placed mobile developer. ON the other hand, iOS development is something which Im familiar now. Im picking up at a good pace.My thoughts were, I could enroll myself in the Big Data hadoop course and pursue my iOS development as a side hobby.My question is,Considering the future demand, pay and general growth, which is the better direction for me?

What are the seminal textbooks to get started on researching the topic and toolchains?;I don't know that there are any established standards (yet) in the space of data mining and big data.  There is a free PDF book called [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/book.pdf) that we used for my data mining course in school.  I don't know that it fits exactly what you are looking for based on your description, but you could look through some of it to get an idea of the general landscape.  It explores more of the ideas and algorithms behind data mining than any particular tools.There is also the O'Reilly book [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) which may or may not be available as a PDF download by less than legal means.  As the name suggests, this book is more hands-on and practical and teaches the Python tools available for interacting with, manipulating, and visualizing data.There are also a lot of MOOCs available.  I started the course called 'Introduction to Data Science in Python' on coursera.org but opted to spend some time with the Python for Data Analysis book first.#thank you.  It was helpful.

Or, ""was there glare off the road surface?""When Bernie went to a state to campaign his numbers bounced by 10-20 percentage points in one week, and the more people were exposed to him, the more they liked him.Clinton is the opposite. It was probably a strategic decision for her not to campaign actively, because the more exposure she gets, the more her numbers go down. People say, ""She should have gone to Wisconsin."" But with a candidate like Clinton, the conventional strategies don't work. You have to send surrogates like Bill or Bernie or Obama or Michelle. That's how much of a dud they had on their hands.#> She's a terrible candidate. Everything else is just ancillary. No, it isn't. It's important to understand just why her campaign failed. Her margins in key states were so close that it was tactical errors that were the deciding factor. "

As background: I’m a 24 years old and graduated in Business and Administration (called Commercial Engineering in Chile), and now I have a steady job analyzing copper exports. I’m not sure I’m doing what I really like, and programming is something that really interests me as a tool to improve my professional skills or (maybe) as a whole new career. Recently I discovered that there are some powerful programming languages that help analyse, present, and work really well with data. I have some basic programming knowledge in html, css, and JS (been doing some python recently). I think the data part of programming is really interesting, and believe it can be applied to almost anything. Since I know some basic concepts, and look forward to keep studying the next couple of months until the curse starts, I feel that I’m somewhat prepared to go into computer science and to specialize in that field of study. I'm kind of lacking some advanced math and statistics concepts, but I do have a really big interest in learning them.Being in this sub a lot, I’ve come to understand that it’s really important to learn the fundamentals and the theory behind this (and all other) CS concepts. That said, here are both graduate programs in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xWwDWniD3OaxMG0gbjE6oarGF0B4AwoabXFGf-AcNls/edit?usp=sharing).

forhire;5x6lko;1488495053.0;/r/forhire/comments/5x6lko/hiring_nyc_1010data_is_hiring_a_c_developer/;[Hiring] (NYC) 1010data is hiring a C developer;"1010data is not a C shop, but we're looking for a C programmer.First, a bit about the company, and then more info about the tools we use. 1010data is a ""big data analytics platform"". We're a medium sized (~250 person) company based in NYC and have been around since 2000. I like to explain our product in the following way… Imagine Microsoft Excel (a tabular spreadsheet view of data). Put that in a web browser so we have something similar to Google Sheets. Now take 100 billion - 1 trillion rows of data, put them in a single spreadsheet, and maintain the ability to manipulate that data in real time. You can create new columns that are a function of other columns, filter and aggregate the data, run more advanced statistical analyses, visualize the data, or build a data driven web application. That's the Trillion Row Spreadsheet and it's the core product that the rest of our business is built around. Most of our server side code is written in k, which is a pretty cool language that I'm not going to discuss at length. k is an excellent tool for vector processing and distributed computing, but there are some tasks it's not well suited for, and that's where this job post becomes relevant. The Core Group at 1010data (the devs that build the product described above) includes the ""Interfacing Team"" which is responsible for two things. First, we solve the problems that k isn't well suited for. This consists of implementing some of the very high performance bits of the system that don't vectorize well, as well as integrating third party tools as to avoid reinvention of the wheel (we didn't feel the need to implement AES in k). Second, we build the code distributed to customers (k is interpreted, we generally don't like to distribute the interpreter). This code is (again) very performance sensitive, but also must be very portable (we've targeted Windows, Linux, OSX, AIX, and HP-UX to name a few targets). Put most simply, the Interfacing Team is responsible for the code that isn't written in k or JavaScript (though we do in fact do some k programming).So what are we looking for? We want someone with C/C++/other-manually-memory-managed-language programming experience who is interested in building high performance tools and libraries for manipulating big data. Generally we look favorably on people with STEM degrees, though there is some preference for people with a computer science background (you're going to be asked algorithm questions and for Big-O analyses during the interview process).  We have positions open at the entry level, though we certainly won't turn away those with deeper experience.If you're interested you can reach out to me directly, or apply via our [careers page](https://www.1010data.com/company/careers/open-positions/position/?id=599812). I am the hiring manager for the team (so I won't get any sort of bonus for applications through that link) but reaching out to me directly can skip some of the recruiting rigmarole. Note that this position is on-site so you'd have to live in or at least within a reasonable distance of New York City.";
