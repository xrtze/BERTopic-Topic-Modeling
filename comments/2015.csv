talesfromtechsupport;3uaxtw;1448509679.0;/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3uaxtw/consulting_wars_part_1_welcome_to_thunderdome/;Consulting Wars, Part 1, welcome to Thunderdome…;  I'm working for a consulting shop and I'm starting a long term project at $Health_Insurer, supplementing their Governance and Risk department. Most of the work is doing assessments of vendors, but sometimes there are other projects. I'm always game for the 'other projects', since I have a belief that I can bring in more work for the consulting shop.    Which, as everybody should know, is consulting job #1.    Unfortunately, there’s another consulting shop at $Health_Insurer(HI). They used to do the vendor assessments, but ‘something bad happened’ and they lost the gig. They’re in charge with a few other related gigs, like tracking and remediating findings, and migrating their existing tracking tool to a $Magical_Vaporware.    As you might imagine, I’m not in a friendly environment.    First gig is to finally force $Big_Data_Vendor(BDV) to submit to an assessment. $Other_Consulting_Shop (OCS) had sent them an assessment, but that came back with a thinly veiled “go away” letter. BDV must think themselves pretty damn special to not even bother to lie to me.    I send the assessment and a nicely worded email to Cassandra, BDV’s Director of Compliance. After three days, I figure it’s time for a phone call.    me:”Hi. Is there some reason you won’t respond to my request?”      Cassandra:”We don’t see the point. HI’s not going to drop us, nor are any other insurers. We have appropriate controls. “    me:”Can I set an appointment with you or your staff to go over this?”    Cassandra:”No. We’re too busy. We already explained why to your predecessor”    Oh, great. Methinks they’re not going to be exactly cooperative.    A conversation with the lead at OCS reinforces this belief. They’re going to call anything other than a full report ‘incomplete’ in the tracking tool, which means:     * We won’t be able to bill for this assessment * This will be an open issue for every status report, giving someone at HI to complain about.    I have to make this happen. I need to get creative.    I poke about BDV’s website and see that their client base is almost entirely healthcare. They do some kind of buzzword compliant big data healthcare event management, which I interpret as ‘can we deny the claim’?    I get an idea. I spoof a 973 area code (North Jersey) phone number and create an alter ego, Vinnie Goombatz, the ‘Director of Analytics’ at ’Garden State Health Insurance’. Vinnie enters his data into the contact form at BDV.    A day later, a chipper sales droid calls Vinnie up on my spoofed number. Vinnie is interested,but he has to send some security person to ‘get some answers’. Sales droid is willing to facilitate, even getting a half day blocked out with Cassandra to answer questions…       I book my flight.

The free plan only allows 20 UPC searches per day. It's such an arbitrary limit. And for $300/month I'd expect no limit on UPC searches.    Edit: Ah. Limits are per *day*. So pro is reasonable. Free is still on the stingy side IMO.#There's a geolocation API built into most modern browsers already. I used it for a weather site.

The op lists it ""turns html into json"", it failed to do that on the sites I entered, and the JSON i got back was rubbish with a massive amount of data missing.When you go to the site it says ""Instantly Turn Web Pages into Data"", so my expectation is I put in a website in the giant url bar and get the data for that page, i did not, i would of got more using html scraping.Also when going to the site the FIRST thing there is the address bar to ""test"" it, if it fails so badly on the first thing you see, why would I even bother going deeper when its clearly shown an incapability for its selling point, it sold short.#Interesting, thank you for the source!#I think if you get caught using it though, it's still against the terms of use.#You can use any manner of flash video downloader you want.

Sadly it's because I'm not so great with interfaces right now and wanted to just make it easy to see and use. #Are you sure about this? I've used a hell of a lot of API's and it's generally recommended to cache results in your own database. As long as you then don't start serving that data as your own API.When I talk to the dev's that create and run the API's we use, they are always very thankful, as it takes a load off their API servers.#So an API that returns json is not an API? I feel like everyone trying to correct me have not actually used import.io#And this is different to API because... ?#I've been trying to explain what the site does. The automatic scraping is not all it does and I don't use that at all.  If a site doesn't offer a rest API you can use import.io to create an API for it.  If you just put a url into the auto scraper then that is a different thing that I have not been talking about. I use a lot of API's and when a site doesn't offer an API it's a pain but import.io has nice infrastructure that makes my job a lot easier.  It's basically the same thing as https://www.kimonolabs.com/#[deleted]#Fwiw, I used plex and I love it. Works amazingly between my desktop, chromecast and phone as a remote. #[deleted]#Hmm, I do remember reading it in the terms of service for at least a few APIs I've used. I'm on mobile now but I'll try to find you some examples later. You have me doubting myself now though, I may just be imagining things :/#Actually, check out the goodreads api for an example. 24 hour cache only, no ""harvesting or indexing"" #I can attest to what he says. I've been really careful with the terms for the Instagram and Yelp APIs that specify that you can store data for a 'session', but as soon as that session is over a user has to make a new request. It would read something like ""Only store or cache user content for the period necessary to provide your app's service.""#You're right, I haven't and I'm not saying anything against it. But just because something returns JSON doesn't instantly make it an API. #Banana hanged on a string is not an API per se, but you can take it if you want.#... Are you doing that on purpose? The data is already there, the service doesnt create an API it just transforms the output.#Can you give an example of its use then? Maybe I am misunderstanding it. If it has other features other than ""turning a website structure into an API"" then I'm not much interested in those as it is not the focal point when you first visit the site.#No, I was just pointing out a cool thing someone worked on.#Definitely! What's the app?If you have any questions pm me your email!#There are some APIs that don't allow caching, but a more common limitation is that you don't cache the data and serve it yourself to others. I know that the Riot (League of Legends) API has this limitation.#That's what I said. Caching is generally recommended with API's. To keep the data fresh, they want you to 'update' cache results if they are 24 hours or older. I typically only cache API results for a couple of hours anyway. No point in having stale data.#Ok, so if I use import.io to create several end points that return various data with a remote call then what exactly about this makes it not an API. It works the same way as every other API I work with. #Guys! I present to you ... my [weather API](http://i.imgur.com/wqwiEBU.jpg)! #You didn't answer the question. Every API I work with just returns data. Using import.io I can create whatever end points I want, I don't see how that is not an API. I honestly want to know the distinction.#I think what everyone is trying to say is that the data returned is not an API. Import.io is the API in this case. All of the data returned is just a JSON response.#When I want data from a website I first look to see if the website offers an API. If they don't, I use import.io to create end points for the data I want. I'm using import.io to create my own API. Import.io takes parameters that can be used by your saved ruleset so you can interact with a third party site programmatically a lot easier. When a site doesn't have their own API you can create one with import.io. I think people think that import.io converts HTML to json but it doesn't actually do that. You build data extractors that can interact with a site and can take parameters such as a search term and you can pick and choose what data using their built in tool or xpath.It's not directly interfacing with their database, it is still working through the third party sites front end but it behaves exactly as if the site offered a native json API. #It doesn't explicitly create APIs it is the API for their transformer. #It's not really a transformer. You use their Software to create new API end points of your own. They do have an API for creating endpoints automatically but I don't use it, I create the extractor manually."

I'm actually unsure if the reason why people down voted me was cos they didn't like the info, or cos they perceived the attitude inappropriate (was going for facetious)#You get a mild case of dead.#I think the cumulative hangover would kill you. #Science will find a way. Even a big war won't stop the population growth!#Yes, but no statue that way#And the human species will be stronger for it because the strong will survive. Money won't help much.#> producing clouds for the same purpose.Do you want the Matrix?  Because that's how you get the Matrix.#This is already happening, if you look up#This is a huge point. Increasing education for women decreases the birth rate significantly. And some people presume we will stabilize around 9-10 billion. The funny thing is that people who live in first world countries (like me) use far more resources per capita than developing countries. Not excusing them, but we need to improve our footprint ecologically as well#Projections put world population around 11 billion in 2100.  that is about 50% increase in world population.  Assuming peak in 2100, we still have to deal with 11 billion people and provide them with the things they need to survive.  More of them will live longer too.  Medical science is pretty amazing.#Gotta give people hope.#[deleted]#The best thing would be to cull white americans/europeans as white people consume nearly 100X the resources as an average african. And there are nearly 600 million more white people than africans. So it would be nearly 600X more beneficial than just culling africans.After the white people, it would be chinese, indians, middle easterners, etc. Then africans as africans consume the least amount of resources.#It doesn't matter.The advanced parts of the world can decide to go green, but the rest of the world cannot.  India and China won't reduce their growth.  If we were all equal, people would care.  Much of the world doesn't have any way to deal with pollution of all types.#There are many things we can do, for example using solar and wind energy, and ban fossil fuel -- in the end making it illegal. A world government dealing exclusively with environmental issues is a very good idea, too. The congress in Paris now in December is the first serious step on the way to saving our planet, I hope.#Ehrlich is not wrong in principle, just in timescale. There will almost certainly be serious ecological repurcussions from overpopulation, we just won't live to see them.#That is exactly right.#But chicken littles sell papers... How will the media make money if they aren't selling fear? #The problem is the right now more than the future.  You and I can live like wealthy first world assholes because you and I are a small part of the population.The world could continue on pretty well if we can keep the poor poor while limiting their pollution.#> The utterly failed ""population bomb"" predictions of the widely-heralded Paul Ehrlich say it all.He predicted fairly accurately, he just didn't account for people using petrol as fertilizer on such a large scale that we're essentially turning oil into food. Which hasn't been *too* much of a problem, but now we drastically need to stop using oil and are in a really shitty place if we don't. Which leaves certain problems in our food production systems. #No, it can.  Just not for everyone.  Either the west needs to come down a peg or the rest of the world needs to stay poor.  We cannot have modern development for everyone, which requires a lot of resources in amounts we cannot produce. Democratization of western luxury lifestyle is impossible right now.  Not everyone can have it.#Not sure about if it was dangerously low at all. But also with the way things currently are, the current mass extinction will rival that of the k-pg or even the hirnantian mass extinctions. Life will go on but it will not even closely resemble hat we see now. Most life forms simply can't adapt fast enough. Only ones that will survive are those who can adapt and survive in a certain niche of the environment Also it was probably 6000ppm way back before the greats oxidation event 1.8 billion years ago. Multi cellular life only came about 600 or so million years ago #Ok. Just curious. I'm not really all that well read up on the earth's orbit and the effect on climate as much as I should be. Thanks for the info!#Computer models that claim to predict the future of the most complex systems ever studied by man are no guarantee of future earnings either.#What can an individual do in the face of runaway climate change other than accept their fate?  To these people the people still trying to fix things look like a person out punching a tank that has rolled into their town.#[Its the end of the world](http://www.globalwarming.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Global-Progress-1-2009.jpg), and yet [everyone feels fine.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-34440567)#It will start with technical people.  After that it depends on scale and the condition of the planet when we start seriously considering a major exodus.  The frontier life may well be more attractive to the adventurous than those who have very comfortable lives.Lots of ways this could play out, but it is important to start moving forward as a species towards expansion.#In the vastness of space there are undoubtedly things of great interest, that someone should experience.  Seems like our ancestors went through an awful lot of work to get us here, seems like it would be lame to just quit now.Maybe I'm just a fan of my species or something. #at least his/her genes have a chance of surviving.#All of the previous generations fucked up your plans.#Don't be so hasty.After all, climate change still could be a natural process (and sorry, but until we hit the zetaflops i don't trust any climate simulations) and otherwise it's way better to have kids now than before previous 2 generations.#I think this is how ""Mole People from the Center of Venus"" starts#Build more stuff.  We don't really need that much more stuff, so make sure it breaks fast so we can build more stuff.  We can't afford to lose jobs, even meaningless ones.  Well, ya we could work on efficiency, design, recyclable materials, durability, and minimizing the environmental impact of the essentials, but that kills the quarterly profits.#Sure, but you can't tell me that's the reason that the Congress of the wealthiest nation in the history of the planet doesn't want to fund any measures to fight climate change. #That doesn't sound so bad, then.#That is why we must never stop!#A nuclear exchange would end basically all agricultural productivity and indeed stop population growth. #lol, science always works until it doesn't. So much hubris.Some people get stuck in the /r/futurology circlejerk#I'd rather select for humans that can take care of their environment than humans that can survive some sort of environmental/societal apocalypse.I'm not even sure it would be proper selection or just RNG.#> Increasing education for women decreases the birth rate significantly.I think it's less the education and more the infant mortality and access to birth control.  Correlation and causation and all that.#Yeah, but that growth isn't due to more babies being born. It's a larger population moving up the age-distribution graph as it ages, but the birth rate remains around replacement levels. So the population should stabilise at about 10-11 million. #I prefer this alternative too, because it limits grieving. If all the dead know each other, but no one outside knows them, there's little sorrow. If fewer are culled, but randomly, everyone on the planet is mourning.#So we'll just have sub-Saharan Africa left to rebuild the world? I'm okay with that. Pretty much the whole area is a bastion of free speech and democracy and happiness.#[deleted]#Banning things hardly ever works out very well, at least for all populations. America tried to ban alcohol in the 1920's and it plain didn't work. Narcotics have a similar global ban, yet billions upon billions is spent every year on that forbidden industry. There are bans on all sorts of speech in various countries as well, yet there are still plenty of dissenters. To change human behavior, which is the root of the problem, it is far more effective to offer an appealing alternative rather than try to pull something out of people's hands. A carbon tax could work, but not unless you have something in the wings to take over that demand. #so, the previous prediction of the world ending was wrong. but, boy, this next prediction will be right!#Check out the Norman Borlaug link. The ""man who saved a billion lives"" has helped the poor thrive—likely more than anyone in human history. Thanks to GMOs, incidentally.#>He predicted fairly accurately, he just didn't account for people using petrol as fertilizer on such a large scale that we're essentially turning oil into food. The Haber-Bosch process has been in use since 1915.   Granted that by training Ehrlich is an entomologist specializing in Lepidoptera (butterflies), but it would be surprising if he didn't know this.  Ehrlich didn't understand the impact of the green revolution and didn't understand how economic growth affects population growth, but then again, he specialized in entomology - why would anyone treat him as an expert in these other fields?>Which hasn't been too much of a problem, but now we drastically need to stop using oil and are in a really shitty place if we don't.Synthetic fertilizer is generally produced with natural gas, not oil.#What he was dead wrong about was human ingenuity. I'd encourage you to read the Norman Borlaug link. The sky is not falling. People need to get used to the fact that human life will indeed continue for countless eons beyond this current, handwringing generation.#You don't need computers to calculate the Precession...the basics were understood 5000 years ago, at least.  The climate connection wasn't made until 1937  which was not a computer heavy time either.#Vote for decent governments. ..#Everyone's genes are about 99.99% the same.

Each country gets to cast one vote. The votes can be counted by France, because nobody is going to vote for them and they hate everyone equally.#Not really that hypocritical - you can acknowledge that we use the most energy in the world, while simultaneously believing that we shouldn't be slaughtered wholesale for the sake of saving energy.As for throwing out the ""wasteful computer"", it's not *nearly* the biggest problem out there in terms of energy waste - a *huge* amount of energy use comes from stuff like air conditioning that's used to compensate for shittily built houses. Or when electricians use the smallest size wire they're legally allowed to (because they cost the electrician less than larger wire sizes, and the electrician is the one who has to buy the wire), rather than a more efficient wire that will save a lot of electricity in the long run (which is irrelevant to the electrician, because he/she doesn't pay your energy bill).Or for that matter, everyone leaving office lights on overnight for ""security purposes"", despite having insurance and it not making a noticeable difference to security.#It didn't work to ban murder either --there are still people who are murdered. But nobody argue that we don't need the ban in question.A global government dealing with environmental issues, working together with UN, and with the authority to write international laws, should be a perfect solution. You don't even need an election system here, because it is all about science.#Not ending, changing.

The degree of enforcement action required would be utterly colossal. We know it doesn't really work either. How many billions have been spent trying to keep cocaine out of the US? Yet, it is still fairly easy to come by in any urban center. Perhaps I am wrong, but from what your saying your suggesting people simply not go anywhere or do anything that might lead to an increased carbon footprint. That isn't going to happen, all a ban like that is going to do is make carbon a black market product. So instead of simply having CO2 in the atmosphere you get CO2 and all the carnage that goes with being a black market product. I get what your saying, that it is ridiculous that people are knowingly destroying the thing that allows them to keep living because they want twinkies from 20 miles away and they want it in the space of an hour. Yet, that is reality. They really don't care what the science says. Forcing them to care is like forcing you to care about whatever it is you find most boring and uninteresting.

One was a database server, and it was packed with 18 drives, 9.1GB 15k RPM Ultra/320 SCSI. Old stuff. I mean, gawd, this thing used massive quantities of EDO DIMM's and was so heavy, it took 3 people to rack them.  &nbsp Now, we used MSSQL on this. The databases were fairly huge, and both HR's and Accounting's databases were on this thing, so it was hammered on a regular basis, what with monthly financials and payroll every week. I learned a lot about SQL query plans and optimizing SQL queries in that role. The goal was always to reduce disk I/O's to keep things moving. It was kinda cool to see all those LED's blinking away like crazy during busy periods.  &nbsp   One day, I'm told we are going to get our first SAN. The company known as ""crooked E"" had partnered with a big-name big-data storage firm to produce private label SAN's. Awesome, awesome, awesome! And new ""crooked E"" servers to boot, waaaaay faster than our Big Steel Behemoths!  &nbsp   So an engineer came to visit, and I made sure he knew we had big performance needs, showed him those 18 spindles, said we want lots of space, and he took note of ""my"" servers and those other ones like the file servers. Fibre channel switches, HBA's, lions and tigers, oh my! This was going to be great!  &nbsp   This engineer even ran load-monitoring software for a couple of weeks to collect metrics. From all that info, he would design a SAN to accomodate all our needs. Sounded delicious to me, can I learn more?  Gimme!  &nbsp   What came back was a CX3 with a single shelf of disk, all 146GB 10k. And the amount of space allocated for the MSSQL system was spread across 4 spindles of 72GB disk -- shared with the file server, no less. I was flabbergasted.  I protested that this was going to severely reduce database performance.  I took perfmon graphs and manufacturer IOPS ratings and tried till I was blue in the face and was told to take it. Ooookay ... ignore evidence at your own peril, boss, but I tried to tell you. My boss was a good man but had pressure from other corners.  &nbsp   Go-live on the new servers & SAN came along, and the complaints blew up my mailbox within days. KABOOM! I pulled out those emails, and the new perfmon graphs showing disk queue saturation, and even walked people into the server room and said ""See that bank of lights? Our old server kept them blinking at 100% load, and the new one is doing the same, 18 blinking lights was better than 4 new blinking lights"".  Within two weeks we were ordered back on the old equipment.  &nbsp   In the end, I was able to use my statistics and analysis to convince my boss we needed another shelf of high-performance, smaller disks to ensure the IOPS were there for the databases. We didn't need smaller disk because they could spin faster, but because there were more spindles. (For those that don't know, a spinny-platter disk can roughly handle about 150 operations per second, rule of thumb. Going from 10k to 15k changes this... a little, not a lot.) Moar spindles! Moar speeeeeed!!  &nbsp   I was then given free reign to completely redesign the storage groups and RAID groups on the entire SAN for all servers. After many spreadsheets and metrics collection & analysis, I was able to implement a brand new layout that generated exactly *zero* complaints about performance. I was very pleased.  &nbsp   Lesson here, kiddies: never ignore the biggest bottleneck of your system. SSDs are really wonderful, by the way. Most apps need I/O throughput, if they deal with a lot of data. CPU and RAM are essential, but not the only story.  &nbsp   TL DR: In which an ancient Compaq Proliant 6000 bested a brand new set of servers and SANs.";"Yup - folk just don't seem to grasp performance (in iops) compared to throughput (in MB/s) and capacity (TB).You can do a lot for bursty IO with SSD caching at the controller level - I love LSI's CacheCade for that. Better yet, ZFS on the array with a properly configured system. Assuming you're not throwing money at something big that implements tiered storage.Something else folk in smaller shops don't always get (although it seems to have been getting better) is that you shouldn't treat iSCSI the same as the rest of your LAN traffic. Latency spikes, out even worse a non-zero TCP retransmit count, can be huge performance killers.#> Compaq Proliant 6000My god, you weren't kidding about this being a long time ago in a server room far, far away!I haven't seen one of those in - well, decades!#Eh... I know those 6000 servers...  You're supposed to be 4 to lift and rack them.  Also, those SCSI320 HDDs were GOOD! (when they were new). I still haven't pulled the last MSA1000-series SAN from the bottom of a rack, yet. It's not as if we need the place, and yeah, the weight of the MSA and additional disk shelf + heaps of SCSI320 drives makes for a stable rack... Can you remember which RAID-controller was in the server? and if it had battery-backed write-cache? (Been a server man since the Prosignia times.)#Yup.. The very reason each of my exchange servers is sporting 24 disks. I didn't need all the space.. I needed spindles.#[removed]#I think you would have enjoyed getting a Hybrid SAN in there.   We just moved from a spinning disk array to a Tegile hybrid and the difference in latency and throughput is night and day.It's amazing.And on top of that, it's compressing and de-duping on the fly.#Thought I was in /r/destinythegame and was very confused...#> I ran a group of PersonSoft servers on a collection of Compaq Proliant 6000's. One was a database server, and it was packed with 18 drives, 9.1GB 15k RPM Ultra/320 SCSI.I loved that hardware back then. I had its ""smaller brother"" (compaq 5500) next to my bed for quite a while, with 4 PPro 200, 4 9.1GB disks (not all slots used), and an external enclosure with 7*4.3GB.I did get into some arguments with my girlfriend back then (""That thing is too loud to sleep!"" -- ""Well, I can sleep with it, and I sure as hell won't switch it off""), and eventually got so used to the noises that it woke me up if the hard disk activity from cron daily early in the morning didn't start for some reason.#The last week or so on TFTS has made me wonder how we got any work done before SSD's.#I agree, more and more people are recognizing that storage IOPS is an important metric. (And that this is why SSD's are absolutely wonderful in end user computers.) Still a ways to go though.    I don't do a lot with iSCSI yet, but for the few links I've set up over standard gig Ethernet, I'm seeing 95% utilization at the network adaptor, and I'm pretty impressed. And that's not even isolated to separate switches yet. Maybe I'm just lucky. Our network isn't that big.    We just put in a new SAN this year, and got a set of SSD's for caching the spinny disk. The performance is really really good so far. I likey!#CacheCade is **not** a cure-all.  I've seen some people with more money than sense throw CacheCade on busy shared webhosting servers (cPanel with hundreds of accounts) and burn through one SSD every few months.#This was in the 2000 or 2001 timeframe when we got those servers, new. It was a super-exciting thing at the time. Really cool stuff to have four honest-to-goodness Xeon processors with those massive heatsinks. Now my smartphone can dance circles around that. :)#Those are SO last century!  *grins*#That is not a name I've heard in a long time....#They were Smart Array something's. 3100es? I did a little Google searching, didn't really remember entirely, too long ago now. I had very little problem with the controllers or the drives other than the occasional failure. It was sturdy hardware, and *definitely* boat anchors.#Wouldn't you be better off with using SSDs by now? Even 24 cheap disks starts to get expensive (more than a couple SSDs that can crush the good ol' disks when it comes to IOPS).#I hope you prepared multiple raid groups, in order to manage the risk of multiple drive failures. I knew an acquaintance that put something like 18 disks in a single array, and even with two spares, he had a triple disk failure that trashed the entire array. And he discovered his backups were weeks old. In the end, he got the server up, but he lost his job over it.#We built our first SCOM DB servers with all SSD disks for the database.. Those things flew!  Space was tight but never iops. It could handle 10x more iops than the spec called for..#Yeah - the same sort of working set calculations apply as you'd use sizing L2ARC for a ZFS system.I really wish LSI would give you change hit metrics for a cachecade VD - not doing so seems like a huge oversight#Ahhh, I remember those days. When moving from one processor in the box to two needed a re-install of Windows (but not Novell), or some major league jiggery-pokery with the HAL modules to get the damn thing to boot again with the extra processor. Fun times.#They probably were, at least in my case.Certainly, I'm thinking the late 90's was the last time I saw one. Certainly not much past 2000 or 2001.#Those boxes are 3 years old. SSD was still big money then. #Check out Exchange 2010/2013 DAG on plain disks with auto reseed.  No raid or mirrored pairs on the DB drives. The system keeps  multiple copies of each DB across several servers. You can configure up to 16 copies. In the event of a drive failure autoreseed grabs a spare from the mount point pool, adds the correct mount point to it and starts seeding a new copy to it.To suffer a data loss I would have to loose the exact same disk across several servers.#Now, are SSD's really good for this type of environment? Wouldn't the SQL queries and database writes eat through the SSD life or have corporate level SSD's gotten to the point that won't matter?#Hah! I have one of those running in my server room right now. Luckily I will know immediately if it ever goes down, the thing sounds like a jet engine. #I fucking love when things follow moore's law. SSDs are getting cheaper, faster, better - rapidly.#They make write optimized SSD disks. We ran the SCOM DB on SSD for 5 years.. Never had a DB disk fail.  The SCOM operations DB is harder on disks than Exchange. #Still big $$.. The 1TB SAS 7.2k RPM drives I'm spinning are $365 each    A 400GB SAS SSD Write Intensive is $2500That would add $51,000 to each server#Yup, just bought a 1TB SSD for under $200 recently. I remember just a couple of years ago you'd be looking to get ~120GB for that much money!#Oh thats gotta be pretty then! Thanks for the info.#What's so nice about your hard drives? I'm paying $65 for 2TB 7200 rpm ones.#How?Given you mentioned you were IOPS-bound and didn't care about the size the point is you could probably get the same performance as those 24 spinning disks with just 2 of those SSDs or so, and thus save $4k. No point in counting 24 SSDs.#SAS, TLER, longer MTBF and extra warranty. Office grade SATA drives won't last too long in a IO intensive environment. #Well I didn't care to a point.. I could get by with half the disk space I have so that is why I compared 400GB SSD drives to the 1TB ones I run. Below that I wouldn't feel comfortable that I had enough free space to perform a DB recovery. #Googled it. Makes sense. Fucking love PCIE solid-state memory, though. Too bad about the expense.#You can be mad about intel's nonsense 2.5"" SSDs all you want (outdated controllers, poor performance, laughable life expectancy), but when they designed those PCIe SSDs they weren't screwing around. 20% of the drive reserved for clean operations (where consumer grade maybe sometimes does 10%), 21.9PB before wearout (where consumer grade is maybe sometimes 90TB) and some 850k IOPS. [Expensive](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820167369) but excellent.#Those SSDs were weird. If I remember correctly, it was just a dark time when they basically dropped the ball for a generation or two or three and used shitty off the shelf crap and stuck their name on it.I use an intel SSD in my home computer for the main setup, and big fat hard drives for slow storage. No complaints here.I do like how certain new phones / tablets / laptops have ssd flash storage built in. Not upgradeable, but fast as hell.#Actually, consumer grade can be even better.[TechReport](http://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead) killed a bunch of SSDs and wrote a report about it.Of course, server grade SSDs are even better."

We showed how knowledge of gift-sized distributions may be used to assess an institution's gift-giving profile, to help set fundraising goals, and to design an institution-specific giving pyramid.We will be answering your questions at 1pm EST (10am PST) on December 16 -- Ask Us Anything!Follow Andy on Twitter [@andyreagan](https://twitter.com/andyreagan) for updates on PhD life and his black lab, Finn.

I had two questions. 1) Does an individuals knowledge of the girts of others effect there own giving? I believe it was in freakonimics that it was mentioned that with taxation, knowing that everyone else is paying there taxes has a large impact.2) Do you have any feelings on the ethics of tax deductions associated with charitable donations, in so far as they all the wealthy to choose where their tax dollars go when the poor are not afforded the same privilege?Thank you so much for doing this AMA!#Institutionally this very unique project and direction to take. What lead to this research taking place at the University of Vermont?#A couple questions - 1) What holidays (other than xmas) seem to spark the highest spikes in charitable gift giving?2) How can smaller charities use this data to project fundraising goals against largest ones, especially in peak times like the holiday season?#Hi Peter, Bill, and Andy. Charities has very different levels of efficiency in terms of $ spent on programs vs administration. Is there any relationship between institution size, efficiency and donation size?#In your paper, why did you decide to use gift rank instead of the actual dollar value of the gift?Thanks!#Hello,I was wondering whether you have attempted (or are planning) to validate your model in other countries, particularly in developing countries? Also, would you expect to see a similar profile for donations made to an external institution (i.e. not within the same country where the gift originated)?#As others have mentioned in previous questions, there seems to be a positive correlation between lower/middle income donations and religious charities. I may have not looked close enough at the article but I was wonder if from a charity's perspective does it make more sense to look for more smaller donations or fewer large donations?#Another question: You suggest that a modified version of Pareto's principle can render better results for charities. While the data seems to corroborate with your analysis, has this been tested/validated yet?#If I'm reading your figures correctly, it looks like people in lower and middle class incomes give to religious organizations more than any other category. When we get to upper class ($200K-$1M) that shifts to education and over $1M the focus is primarily on education and health. As income increases, donations to religious organizations decrease. Can you comment on why you think this is the trend? Were there other factors that help explain this? For example, do education levels follow the same trend? I'm thinking of work done in the social sciences that suggests education and health are some of the most impactful places to donate. Perhaps higher education means a more likely exposure to this kind of research. But there is also perhaps a refocus of how those funds are being spent. Religious donations tend to be towards someone's own faith community - i.e. it is donating to help the in-group. Health and education are bigger categories that encompass in-group and out-group. #Your manuscript shows a fascinating trend in religious giving that seems to correlate strongly with income level. Do you think that socio-economic and/or culutural pressures are influcencing this trend? In other words, if you corrected for cultural factors in your models if these trends would survive the conditional analysis? Similary, does education level strongly predict educational giving? Do we simply give to what we know (suggesting that outreach, education, and community involvement would be key to fundraising efforts, more than, say, the emotional impact of the charity- ie giving to disaster aid or toys for poor children at the holidays) or are there other major effect factors at play that you have identified?#Hi, I have a question for Dr. Dodds. Dr. Dodds, social contagion and sociotechnical phenomina must be rapidly evolving fields, in recent years what do you think has been the most surprising or exciting development in these fields, and what if any change in these dynamics do you see happening as a result of new social media platforms used by youth (ex. snap chat, yik yak, etc). Thank you for taking the time out of your day to do this!#How do concurrent natural disasters affect gift distributions?#What is a ""giving pyramid""? The only thing that comes to mind is the huge company I worked for that would collect money on Fridays for a charity. The money came from employees, but the company might have been writing off the deduction.#This AMA is being permanently archived by *The Winnower*, a publishing platform that offers traditional scholarly publishing tools to traditional *and* non-traditional scholarly outputs—because scholarly communication doesn’t just happen in journals.To cite this AMA please use: [https://doi.org/10.15200/winn.145027.70004](https://www.thewinnower.com/papers/3113-plos-science-wednesday-we-re-peter-dodds-bill-gottesman-and-andy-reagan-we-published-a-paper-in-plos-one-that-constructed-a-model-that-can-help-establish-an-institution-s-gift-giving-profiles-and-h)You can learn more and start contributing at [*thewinnower.com*](https://thewinnower.com)#What do you think are some of the best applications of big data learning to date?#Which religion yields the most gifts per quarter?

One question:1) Who donates the most of their income relative to their salary?#Do you anticipate that similar power rules might influence other charitable behaviors? Which ones?Has this study influenced your own patterns of giving?#Hi,Do you think there is potential for future licensing and widespread application of your modeling?#Bill Gottesman:  For part two of your question, I have a personal answer, but it is not based on our research.  I do believe (but don't know the data) that our tax deduction system plays a very substantial role in our giving behavior, and consequently leads to very substantial benefit to our society via philanthropic gifting.  It is true that tax deductions subsidize donations to charities - I see this as saying that our government wants us to give to charity, and that the government sees philanthropy as so important that it is willing give up its tax share to enable us to do that.  If a person has little income, and pays no tax, the government can not contribute to that person's gift, but neither does the government demand a tax from that individual.#Peter Dodds:1) Great question and we'd be most interested to dig into this but we don't have the data just yet.  It's possible that Facebook could get somewhere with an internal (and ethical) study.  We'd need somehow to see people exhibiting to their connections and publicly that they've donated money, and then be able to see what their connections do. It's hard to get this kind of fine grained data about social networks and have it be high quality (subsampling networks is very problematic).  Just talking among ourselves here, we would conjecture that some kinds of sharing of donation information might be counter productive.And all this is more generally about social contagion and the establishment and erosion of norms.  My feeling is that we have plenty of ideas and theories—we need to really look hard at all this data we have (acknowledging that big data is not in any way complete data).#Peter Dodds: Among other things, I've been working on social systems and what I've come to call sociotechnical phenomena from 2000 on (I was at Columbia from 2000 to 2006 formally working in the social sciences). With Chris Danforth, I run the Computational Story Lab housed within the Vermont Complex Systems Center, and we're simply interested very broadly in systems-at-large, particularly ones with social aspects.  We have work running the gamut from social contagion, influence, fame, measuring happiness and emotion, stories, language evolution, conflict (including school shootings), as well as geo/eco/bio/whatevero-stuff. Both Bill and Andy took my class Principles of Complex Systems a few years ago, and this particular project on philanthropy grew out of a project initiated by Bill.#Peter Dodds: Among other things, I've been working on social systems and what I've come to call sociotechnical phenomena from 2000 on (I was at Columbia from 2000 to 2006 formally working in the social sciences).

They may see from plotting their yearly gift data in the log-log format of our figure 1 whether the largest gifts fall below the expected amount.  I would suggest (note that I lack the experience of a professional fundraiser) that the institution would learn that they are not asking their largest donors to reach as high as they should - in other words, they should be asking for more.  The biggest bang for the buck, fundraising-wise, is from the largest donors, so it is important to get these donors to reach properly.  Similarly, if an organization finds that they have a large gamma, they may benefit substantially more than a lower gamma organization by casting a wider net to procure a larger donor base, as demonstrated in figure 9 of our paper.Lastly, if the organization plans their campaign using a donor pyramid, I would suggest that they construct a pyramid specific to their gamma, as described in figure 11.  I would hope this would more realistically estimate what they can achieve from their donor base, but I want to emphasize this part of our model is hypothetical based on very reasonable assumptions, but has not been tested prospectively.#Peter Dodds: Re 1) Somewhat out of our area of expertise, but natural disasters are one example that elicits spontaneous gift giving (and keeping the public's interest in a particular event is a major concern for institutions in this area).  Religions structure gift giving of all sizes over different time scales, and with respect to special events (e.g., for Christianity, giving small donations every Sunday at Church).Bill just mentioned that at least for the University of Vermont, we can see that gifts are far fewer over the summer but are much larger in size compared with the rest of the year.  We're not entirely sure why this may be and it's the only institution for which we received such granular data (all the others gave us gift sizes as a function of year rather than date).#Andy Reagan: we don't have data on the ""efficiency"" of the organizations we studied. This would be very interesting to look at!#Peter Dodds: This would be very interesting but we don't have this data on hand. For the next level of this research, we either need a sizable team of people connecting with institutions, or to be able to capitalize on some kind of standardized reporting of gifts to institutions by those institutions.  This information is almost always held by the institution and comes in many different formats.#Bill Gottesman:  Important question.  As a personal comment, if an organization is on the Charity Navigator website, I strongly consider its ranking on administrative size and programmatic support.  Nicholas Kristof published a review of Dan Pallotta's book ""Uncharitable"" here: (http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/25/opinion/25kristof.html) .  Mr Pallotta argues that it is ethical for fundraisers to claim a large profit from dollars raised if the institution is made better off by his/her efforts.  As a donor, if I knew that a large part of my gift went to someone's personal gain, I would instead choose a charity where my gift went to programs.#Bill Gottesman: Perhaps Andy or Peter can comment further on the nature of power-law distributions and their usefulness in describing wealth and income.  We do use the actual dollar value of the gift on the y axis, and compare this to the rank of gift on the x axis.  The log-log format is necessary to visualize the linear relationship between the logs of these values.#Peter Dodds: The two main ways to represent these heavy-tailed kinds of distributions (frequencies of words in texts, earthquake magnitudes, ...) are by ranking the quantities or plotting size distributions. It turns out that these are (simply) connected but it took 50 years for this to be widely understood.  The mode of presentation varies somewhat according to taste/scientific culture.Details: The rank or Zipf distribution is the flip of the complementary cumulative frequency distribution. I have slides covering this link and many other aspects of power-law size distributions here:http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/teaching/courses/2015-08UVM-300/content/lectures.html#slides-power-law-size-distributionsWhich I discuss in the video here:Episode 04: The Statistics of Surprise.The everywhereness and terribleness of power law size distributions.

Gaussians, Schmaussians.http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/teaching/courses/2015-08UVM-300/content/lectures.html#episodes-E04#Bill Gottesman:  Excellent questions!  We are mathematicians, and this paper was written in the mathematical context of applications of power-law modeling.  I would love to see further data collection and development by researchers in the field of philanthropy.  [Peter - would our department be able to partner with outside researchers here?]#Peter Dodds: It's all a question of getting hold of quality data. For example, some developing countries may not have robust enough taxation systems which would help with some of the analyses. What we'd really need for the next study would be data from many institutions, both public and private and varying in kind, ideally numbering in the 1000s or more.  For the work we're discussing here, we had to obtain data through personal connections and meetings which is of course slow—somehow, we need to be able to get at a big data version.#Bill Gottesman: See the section which discusses Figure 9, which refers to total gifts received as a multiplier to gifts given by the top 12 donors.  For institutions with a small gamma (meaning exceptionally large top gifts), looking for more smaller donations does not greatly affect the total raised.  For institutions with large gammas (meaning the top gifts are not exceptionally large), enlarging the donor pool has a much more significant effect, and it may be worth casting a wider net.  Please note that I am not a fundraiser, and am speaking from the perspective of our model, not from direct fundraising experience.#Andy Reagan: Good question! This part of our model is hypothetical and is based on very reasonable assumptions, but we have not tested our model with an active fundraising campaign.#Bill Gottesman: According to the Giving USA Foundation 2011 Annual Report on Philanthropy for the year 2010, written by the The Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University (www.givingusa.org), in terms total dollars given, the wealthy give more to religion than the lower and middle classes, but less as a proportion of their total giving.  I can not say what is the root of the trend you identify.  That Giving USA report has a wealth of information, but does not specify how giving is related to an individual's level of education.  That information may exist elsewhere in the vast philanthropic literature.  I like your ideas about in-group and out-group.#Bill Gottesman:  In terms of socio-economic and cultural influences influencing giving to religious organizations, I refer you to the first reference in our paper, the Giving USA Foundation 2011 Annual Report on Philanthropy for the year 2010, written by the The Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University (www.givingusa.org).  This 300 page report contains a wealth of information, including many socioeconomic factors related to giving.  In their section on Giving to Religion, they cite several demographic findings: 1) High net worth households were more likely to give to religious institutions than the general population, but with a much smaller share of their total charitable dollars, 2) More female headed households gave to religious organizations than male headed households, 3) Rural donors gave a higher percentage of their income to religious organizations than urban donors, but the actual dollar amount was higher for urban donors, 4) Affluent African American donors were more likely to give to religious institutions than affluent non-African American donors.  No hypotheses were given as reasons for these trends.The report did not comment on the relation between educational level and educational giving.Our model for gifting is a rudimentary model based on power-law distributions, based on a few simple premises and observations.  You ask an important question about other major factors that influence an individual's giving preferences -- our model was based solely on available data relating income to philanthropic gifting.  I wish I had an answer to this part of your question.#Peter Dodds: This is such a huge question!  We've definitely seen some successes and failures.  It now seems all very normal but the rise of social media has been extraordinary.  Back in the early 2000s, we were thinking mainly of creating large-scale social experiments (and we had some great successes with the small-world experiment and music lab).  Twitter has been a big thing for us but so has having the 20 years of the NYT, decades of music lyrics, and so on.  Being able to see small, everyday writing from people and to then be able to say something about populations is pretty amazing (and has a dark flipside of course).  We have done a lot of work on measuring happiness and you can see various pieces at http://hedonometer.org (Twitter time series but also the trajectories of books and movies in the manner of Kurt Vonnegut).Perhaps the main thing that's unfolding is the connectivity of people, for good and bad.  It's different.  From a bootstrapping, education point of view, kids all around the world follow each other on instagram to learn how to improve their drawing.  And of course Wikipedia is now part of many kids' brains.  Now we're in the data rich stage of social sciences, moving out of being data scarce, we have to of course remain cognizant that big social data is not complete social data. It's easy to think it is because there's just so much.As I said, we've seen some failures on the research side. Several studies on social contagion (e.g., showing obesity spreads among friends) have proven to not hold up that well.  Google Flu trends was initially spectacular but then had some issues.  I do believe these things will be sorted out. We're still at such an early point the history of big social data, and showing the limits of predictability for a science is a crucial, natural step.  We're getting there with weather for example, where we now understand the prediction horizon pretty well.  What we'll be able to do with socio-economic systems, I don't know.  We just have to work hard!Extra: we've also just published a paper on the Google Books corpus saying it's unfortunately kind of a mess.  It's library like (each book is represented once rather than by some measure of real popularity), and more concerningly, it's full of scientific literature.http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137041#Bill Gottesman:  I do not have a direct answer to your question, but Chen, Wang, and Wang studied the philanthropic response to the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.  They describe a power law model of giving for the larger gifts, and propose a probabilistic model for donation.  See http://iopscience.iop.org/0295-5075/88/3/38001 .#Bill Gottesman:  Giving pyramids are commonly used in capital campaigns to reach a specific fundraising goal.  For example, the charity may seek 100 gifts at $200 each, 30 gifts at $500 each, 10 at $1,000, 3 at $10,000 and 1 lead gift at &25,000.  I believe a pyramid distribution of gifts is commonly derived from Pareto's 80/20 rule with a gamma of around 1.9.  See figure 11 in our paper to compare pyramids for organizations of different gammas.  The difference between them is huge in terms of higher level gifts and total amounts raised.  This would suggest that a standard pyramid does not exist - i.e. one size does not fit all.   An individual organization may generate a more realistical giving pyramid using the their own gamma as a reference for its construction.#Andy Reagan: Big data means a lot of different things to different people, and big data has been around for awhile before big *social* data and the buzzword came online. A great success of modeling and prediction has been weather forecasting, which has steadily improved since the 1970's. Modern applications of social data are allowing us to understand collective human dynamics in new ways, and this is both fascinating as well as immediately useful for feedback on our social systems (an example being the real-time sentiment of whole populations at hedonometer.org).#Andy Reagan: We don't know (and would more data to try to answer this question).There is a good chance than someone has looked at this in the philanthropy-specific literature.#Andy Reagan: We don't know (and would more data to try to answer this question).There is a good chance than someone has looked at this in the philanthropy-specific literature.#Bill Gottesman:  In figure 4 of our paper, we comment that the top 0.15% of FY2001 tax filers gave at the highest rate: 4.8% of their income to charity, compared to 2.9% for all tax filers.  I think you may be asking about other demographic categories, such as age, marital status, education, etc.  I do not know answers for those categories.#Bill Gottesman:  This is a personal question, and a personal answer.  Yes, this study has influenced my giving.  I have been motivated to give more, and to consider the categories of my gifting.  In addition the the categories listed in our paper, I think of giving as local, regional, national, and international.  I also have looked at some low-gamma organizations in terms of their financial health.  If the lead donor gives upwards of 30% of the total raised, I question the institution's financial health in terms of reliance on a single source of funds.#Bill Gottesman:  I do think there is a fair chance that this model could be developed into a useful software application for fundraisers and charities.  To be responsible, it would require analysis of far more datasets for its development.#Andy Reagan: I'll add that education levels would very likely follow the same trend, but of course that wouldn't mean that it is the reason. Really interesting question to get at!#> they may seek 100 giftsNow I really don't understand.#I think it was the word ""gift"" that was confusing me. Can I interpret ""gift"" as ""donation""?#Please take a look at figure 11 of our paper, and see if that helps.

It started with the basic statement that global average temperatures were rising.  Not accepted. Then it was accepted but the statement that it was caused by human activity was not accepted. Now that statement is accepted but the idea that anything can be done about it is not accepted.  Before international cooperation can occur the people of the world have to do more accepting and less denying. #Well, we'd better get ready for centuries of harm, then. It seems indisputable by now that meaningful action to arrest climate change would require tremendous international cooperation and sweeping changes to society. That's simply not going to happen. We'd better start preparing to live with a new climate.#Sadly, I completely agree.   I'm being honest when I say it is impacting my decision to have kids or not.  May sound strange or like am overreacting, but it is what it is.  Don't want to put a descendent into a terrible situation.#Self-fulfilling prophecy.

It's yours, along with everyone who finds it easier to buy into this pitiful defeatism.For fuck's sake, the guy below me is afraid to have kids. If you care that much, then lobby your mayor. Talk about it as much as you talk about terrorism. Vote green. Go to rallies.

Even the federal government can't do much about climate change, not on its own and not without overwhelming political unity within the country. It's a transnational problem that demands a transnational solution, and that solution is one that no one likes. It would require kicking the ladder out from under developing nations by forcing them to abandon the cheap, dirty energy they can afford in favor of expensive energy sources they can't. And most of all it would require a tremendous change in the structure of Western society: moving people out of suburbs and into cities, building a vast new high-efficiency public transit network, severely curtailing air travel.... the list goes on and on. There is absolutely no precedent for that level of cooperation in the entirety of human history, especially to tackle a nebulous future threat when there are so many more immediate problems. I'm sorry, I just don't think it can be done. #While there is no precedent for this level of co-operation, there is no precedent for our ability to effect it either. Unity among the state and federal governments is doable with the right strength of popular support. We are more socially networked than ever. Not only that, but the United States is in a position of unprecedented hegemony that will last decades, so the US and allies have the ability (and duty) of coercing developing nations into abandoning dirty energy. We can't afford cynicism. The changes you've described don't even come close to adding up to a dominant strategy when the stakes are so dire. "

It's very intuitive and you can make great visualizations pretty quickly.#As someone who has been using tableau in depth for awhile now, I found this article a little disappointing. I came to a company that has been using Tableau exclusively for our data visualization. I was hoping this would provide a bit more details on the other software out there. Tableau is amazing, but it does have its pain points and short comings and I've been getting curious about alternatives. I was hoping the article would go into a bit more details about the pros and cons of each piece of software. Regardless, it's still nice to see so many listed together so you can go off and do further research. #If you truly want to get your hands dirty, nothing beats Shiny at this point.

And makes your end result prettier to look at. Correct?#Can D3 help in the context of big data?Because it is low-level, D3 may seem like a bad fit for big data analysis.

(Currently have MPH and MS in Statistics);[deleted];"[deleted]#You are an interesting case....  My first gut feeling is to recommend you to complete an Associate's degree in CS at a local community college. A course sequence like CS-1, CS-2 (Object Oriented Programming), Data Structures, Algorithms, Programming Languages, plus one or two more. Given that professionally you are probably going to do what a lot of people call ""data science"" these days, you may want a course on databases (even though you know SQL), and a course on AI/Machine learning.This is probably the fastest way, if you want an education to back you up. Associate's degree does not count for much by itself, but you have two MS degrees, one of which is in Statistics, so this makes you look reasonably good.You probably don't want a BS degree.  For MS degrees, there are two options. There are some that admit people without necessary prerequisite coursework. They largely suck to be in. Other programs will require preliminary coursework - they will prepare you well, but add another year to your studies.  Either way, the CC coursework is going to be a good step. You will be able to see after completing it how competitive you are on the market.PS. There is an implicit assumption that you are in the US, as this might work differently if you are elsewhere.#There are many masters programs for CS which are available with no prior experience and an unrelated undergrad degree. The fact that you even know what SQL and R are is good enough! I do think it is quite odd to get a second bachelors if you already have a higher level degree with the masters though. I'm saying this as a person who is doing a second bachelors, btw! It might also be a good option for you because some second degree bachelors programs only take ~2 years, like mine.#With that background, honestly, if you just teach yourself some programming concepts, you really won't need another degree to get a programming job anywhere.  Definitely if you have the means, time and interest to do an MSCS, though, you should have no trouble getting into a program and doing well at it (the part I struggled with the most when I did my MSCS was the statistics and probability stuff).  They'll make you take some ""leveling"" undergraduate courses before you can begin your graduate work, but there's really no point in getting a second bachelors degree.#I'm in a similar situation - I did my undergraduate degree in psychology, and I'm finishing an MSc in neuroscience.  Like you said, the day to day can be pretty mind numbing, so I'm looking at pretty much the same options that you listed.  Some schools in my area offer one year post-degree programs in CS that cover all of the core classes and set you up well for a master's degree in CS.  Coming from stats your math background is probably much stronger than mine, so that might be more than you need.  Ultimately I plan to do a course-based master's in CS, which I've heard is a great way to change fields and be attractive to employers in a short amount of time.I'm also doing a few things to try to make myself look more attractive to graduate CS programs as a non-CS student.  Since I have research experience I was able to find a CS lab at my school that was willing to take me for a practicum, which I have to do for my MSc anyways.  It's a great way to learn from successful CS students while contributing to a project that you can actually put on your CV, and it's also a good way to get a reference letter from a faculty member in the field.  Since I primarily use R for my data cleaning and analyses, I'm planning to contribute to some user-made packages.  A lot of them accept contributions on GitHub, and I've been told that contributing to open source is a good way to build a CV.#I would go for another grad degree at this point. You might have to take a few undergrad level courses first as part of the program,  but that's pretty standard no matter the major. #I would recommend something with real-world applications as well. A BS is overkill, but if you can't translate algorithms to actual code then you're dead in the water.#Well, if I could get a job without extra coursework that would be ideal. Taking a few courses (like the things you suggested) sounds like a good idea though. Any recommendations for programs? :-) I figure it's similar but in psych there were definitely research-heavy/academia programs vs. real-world preparing programs.#Thanks! I saw there were some ""professional"" programs but I agree that they don't seem to be the best option. Maybe I can just take some courses at nearby schools to get started. Any recommendations for programs? :-) I figure it's similar but in psych there were definitely research-heavy/academia programs vs. real-world preparing programs.#Yeah, I didn't really want to do another bachelors considering I had masters degrees, but I wasn't sure if the admissions people would laugh in my face since I don't have any CS coursework under my belt.#Cool, thanks for the advice! Glad to hear I can just take some undergrad classes to make up for the lack of basics. Just wondering, any recommendations on good MSCS programs in the US? I live in the Northeast but I highly doubt MIT will take me haha. #Most MS in CS programs are not research-heavy, although many do require a thesis, which gives a taste of what CS research is. This is not a bad thing.As for recommendations, it depends on your location and willingness to abandon your current situation and move.  As I mentioned above - doing a few community college courses without leaving your job is probably a good start. #The admissions people won't laugh at your face. A given MS program either accepts people such as yourself or it does not. If it does, you may or may not need to do extra coursework.  #Actually I seem to recall that MIT specifically rejects applicants who've finished a masters degree at a different university, so you're probably correct, no matter what your credentials are.  Otherwise, though, it probably depends a lot on your GRE scores.  Are your GRE scores from your last degree current (< 5 years old?)  If not, you'll have to retake it  study up on the math and try to get a perfect score.As far as programs go, I only applied to one myself (UT Arlington), because it was right next door to where I worked, but most people refer back to this list: http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings"

Never thought this day would come, but now I have a choice here of which I am both grateful and concerned.                                     **Company A**: I was an intern last year at this relatively ""well-known"" game company. They have offered me an internship this year again (related to big data, which is what I want), in a different department. However when I was there, I discovered gaming is not my thing and no matter how different work I'll do, it will always be related to gaming and I feel I will not be able to break out of that niche in future if I wanted to.                           **Company B**: The next choice is to sign the offer letter of a ""BIG4"" but the project I will be working on is not directly related to big data. I will have 2 other team mates doing the same work. The company is huge and has all sorts of departments and great perks, and my mentor from company A says that it will help me grow in the long run. I have a few days to reply back to company B. The pay at this place will be about 15% more than at company A.                            I feel like I am still not happy with either of these options in front of me. I have always wanted to work at G or FB, but I am still waiting to hear back from them, and am unsure whether I will get an interview date soon since it is already winter vacation. Plus I have to reply B soon. Last year, I got to the hiring committee review at G but was denied because they ran out of space for more interns. :(                                           I'm a hard worker and I have secured these offers by trying really hard, and they were never easy for me. However, I am unsatisfied and unsure whether choosing one (either A or B) will look like a good decision in retrospect when it is summer. My heart lies at G and FB. My interest lies in Big data and I want to gear my career towards it. G and FB pay almost 20% more than B and almost 50% more than A. Money is not important to me at this point, but it would be a great help if I could secure G or FB.                              Has anyone been in such a situation before? Are there suggestions for me? I would like to hear if any college student has been through such thoughts before, and how they resolved it.             Thank You.";"Hi, I hope I'm not too late.***Disclaimer***: I was an intern at Riot Games in Summer of 2014. I now work full-time at a Big4 (may not be the same big4 you have an offer for, I'm at Amazon, but it's still 50% more than Riot Games, all compensation included).I would *strongly*, ***strongly*** suggest you take the Big4 offer. The work doesn't *seem* nearly as glamorous, but Riot Games is not what it seems. Sure, it has more perks now (especially with the free food on the new campus), but **I would not recommend this place to anybody with a penchant for learning**, or anyone who wants to grow and learn to become a *good* software engineer. You say you're interested in ""big data"". ***That's awesome***. Take your passion elsewhere - Riot Games is **not** a ""big data"" company. They don't ***make*** ""data-informed decisions"". They've **already made decisions** for their release roadmap -- they just have to figure out how to phrase it as if the community wanted it to begin with. All four of the big4 (Amazon/Microsoft/Google/Facebook in terms of intern/new grad hires) companies have much better ""big data"" problems to solve - I can't think of a better place to be besides there. ***Stay as far as you can from Riot Games if you want to become a better engineer***, especially if you're still in college / a fresh grad. If you're an experienced engineer and want to solve hard problems, you'll be ""*that smart guy in the room*"", which I didn't want to be when I graduated, so I chose somewhere else. **Yes**, it's an awesome internship experience. And **yes**, I'd totally go work there, *if I didn't have anywhere else to go*. But **you** have options. ***You*** have better places to be, ***especially*** since you have ambitions that don't include gaming (I do, but I still wouldn't recommend Riot Games for gamers - there are much better companies out there that do way cooler things). If you're big into the gaming culture, or buy into the idea that ""*Riot has a better reputation because it was on Glassdoor's greatest places to work, as well as praised all around for having a great culture*"", ***and have no other options when it comes to an internship***, then that's cool, go work there. If you have further questions, ***please ask them here***, either as a reply, or as a PM. You can check my post history if you think I'm joking, or that I'm ""some random troll who has no idea what he's talking about"". I had the same ideas that you did, but after I finished my internship at Riot, I lost all respect for Riot in terms of ""would this be a good place to work after I graduated"", and immediately sought to work ***anywhere else*** because of how little I realized I could learn from those around me. Becoming a subject matter expert is awesome (you're going to do this wherever you go), but with so few **good** role models around you, it's ***so difficult*** to learn anything unless you're in an incredible awesome org, and there's only one right now (not my team, but they're also not looking for people... so...).#Sounds like you are working at RIOT. My friend did a RIOT internship in big data and then moved to Amazon.I would just go with the bigger brand this time with more salary. You could worry about shifting teams later while you collect nice fat paychecks.#Choose B. Normally I'd say company A would be better because you are more interested in the subject. But you've decided you don't like the industry and you don't want to work there in the future. And it seems like internship programs get really good reputation by treating their interns very well. So I'm sure you'll get an interesting project.#If it was Amazon or Apple, then I would say go for B (especially if you are on the systems/services side). Microsoft though? I am not aware of anything interesting that they are doing with big data. Not compared to the many other companies in Silicon Valley.#Have you talked to the recruiter at B and requested a different project? Tell them that not working on big data is probably a deal breaker for you and ask if they can do anything about it.#>I do, but I still wouldn't recommend Riot Games for gamers - there are much better companies out there that do way cooler thingsDo you mind if I ask: which in particular and why?#PM'd you! and thanks for your detailed response. Looking to get more perspective from others.#Thank you. I'm leaning more towards that, however unconditionally.#Thank you. I have been in touch with a former intern, and it seems they liked their work/project. According to them, it was more fun and less work. I have no doubt I will have loads of fun at B. It's just my aspiration of getting my feet wet in big data that will remain unfulfilled for at least 1 year.#How feasible is it to leap frog as a data scientist/engineer later in your career if you did not learn/practice/workon those skills/projects during internships in college?#Microsoft research consistently does *extremely* well in most Machine Learning competitions, and just won ImageNet (http://blogs.microsoft.com/next/2015/12/10/microsoft-researchers-win-imagenet-computer-vision-challenge/). They are doing far more for advancing ML systems than Apple (not sure what ML teams at Amazon are working on), and it does show in their products too. Hololens and Kinect are built off of some of these ML systems, and now everything that runs windows also has a huge ""big data"" component to it. I don't think MS is a bad place to be at all for data science, but it is very hard to get into without a PhD or MS.#My would-be manager at B is supposed to get in touch with me on Monday or Tuesday to discuss in detail about the project. It certainly is not a big data thing and the internship I have been accepted to doesn't have big data related works at all. However, B is a huge place and they definitely have a lot of big data going on in each of their departments. They might not offer me those works this summer but there are prospects of securing that the next summer. I am a sophomore btw.#***Blizzard***, because they're doing things that nobody's tried before, and actually creating new niches of gamers within genres that are pretty static at the moment (Overwatch for FPS, Heroes of the Storm for MOBA, LotV for co-op / campaign / RTS, WoW for MMORPG). No other game company in the world has the diversity in the set of PC games that Activision-Blizzard offers.***Valve*** - so I know some Rioters that left for Valve, because... well, it's ***Valve***. If *you* had a job offer from Valve (they don't give these out that often, you need around 15-20 years of industry experience before they even bother reading your resume), you ***should*** take it in a heartbeat if you're into any part of the gaming industry. Sure, they don't make / design games anymore (outside of balancing things like DotA2 or CS:GO), but the platform to help distributors / game makers / community is **incredible** when you look at it from 10000 feet.***Twitch***, because despite ""only being a streaming company"", being bought by Amazon was one of the best things that could have happened to the company. In a few years, we'll see the community of gamers / streamers / hobbyists balloon to new heights - all because Twitch is hiring like crazy to build new and amazing things for their users, every single day.Riot Games ***used*** to be one of the pinnacles of game companies. Now that they've stagnated, they're an ""okay"" place to work, but only if you have a family, and only if you're okay with never learning anything *useful* for things outside of their hyper-specific domain space (they don't solve a lot of the same problems that Blizzard or Valve have to solve, but the problems they have are pretty unique, if not somewhat trivial).#Responded! :) Thanks for reaching out. Good luck with whatever decision you end up making!#I don't know. I got my internship based on my school projects in big data, then that internship turned into a job offer. The recruiter messages I now get are for positions related to my job role.BTW, Data Scientist/Engineer is really vague. Some are pure researcher roles. Some are systems and infrastructure. Some are applications. There is a fair bit of overlap. All the guys on my team (except for me) are senior+ level and have experience in all three.#MSR is very hard to get into even with a PhD. Apparently the bar for researcher positions is good school in academia level hard.#ML is cool, but I'm talking about big data. Challenges with data, systems, and algorithms at massive scale. It may include ML, but only ML operating at massive scale. MS is not well-known for this.#Is it Microsoft? If so, you are probably out of luck, but in any case you should still tell your RECRUITER not your manager. Your recruiter might be able to help you. Your manager cannot help you with this. Talk to a recruiter.  #Is Microsoft not a good place to be for wannabe data scientists college students? I am not questioning your response and/or authority. I need someone else's (like your) perception.#They are a great place to intern. The problem is that they match you with a team before you interview, so after you've interviewed it is difficult and almost impossible to change your team placement. If it were Amazon, then you could still possibly get them to change your team. (Amazon, since you said big 4, but also mentioned it wasn't Google or Facebook.)   You should still talk to your RECRUITER about changing teams. Also ask your manager if the team has any big data related work you can do (or if he could place you with a team in his department that does), but like I said MS places you before the offer, so if you don't like your placement you might be out of luck."

I love it, but it recently struck me that, as a relatively new career path, I have no idea what the long-term career strategy is. I wondered what thoughts from the community were about this?Where do you plan on taking your career in social media?How will the industry develop? Will the focus be on big data analytics or creative content development?How does it compare to the career path of traditional marketing, PR or journalism?  ;"As someone who started working in social media around 2004, you better like the agency life. You will either be working for, or with one for as long as you decide to follow this path.I moved from social community management to social analytics, digital analytics and now am head of analytics for a marketing agency... and should be working, not pissing around on reddit. #This post really resonates with me. I'm 19 years old and currently in an apprenticeship doing Digital Marketing. I'm constantly though questioning where next? I enjoy a lot more of the Social Media side of things rather than monitoring data pools for email sends. It's simply coming down to the fact that I need a clear direction but this career path, in my opinion, is fairly ambiguous.#I worked on social media (content, measurement, planning, paid, etc.) at agencies for five years and have transitioned into a more marketing-focused role in-house. From my perspective social spans PR, Marketing, Adv, and Corp Comms which means the career trajectory can vary widely. In my case, I was really strong with technology/analytics and utilized my social experience to dive further into growthhacking and marketing automation. Overall, social media skills (business focused skills, that is) really translate well to marketing, but it is a hurdle to go from social at an agency to in-house marketing because most in marketing associate social with top-of-the-funnel lead generation as opposed to stronger conversion. I'd be curious to see where others have ended up after starting/spending time doing social... I bet it varies widely based upon the individual. #Unless you go to a very big company, there isn't a ton of room for growth within social media itself. The best path at smaller companies is to expand to other digital marketing positions and ones that include cross-functionality of multiple digital marketing aspects.Within an agency you may have the ability to expand to driving social strategy for clients rather than being in the weeds writing messages and posting updates. Same is true on the company side where there are growing numbers of positions to help design social strategy and how it fits into the overall digital marketing mix and helps to support your other sales/marketing/etc efforts across the entire company.Going the route with a company/brand rather than an agency is going to offer more opportunities and higher pay. Agencies top out fairly quickly and you have to be willing to jump from agency to agency in most cases.#likely to social strategy, then digital marketing, then overall marketing (social, digital, communications, etc)#I've always envisioned doing social media management and marketing work for some time and then transitioning to a kind of ""director of digital marketing"" for a big company as an end goal. It just makes sense because of the experience and skills you would learn by practicing SMM for years.#I've been in some form of social media since 2007 when it was just beginning to get big online. I've been wanting out of it as it feels like it gets a bit repetitive and it can be (is) an ALWAYS ON CALL type of job. I've gone from agencies to an in house social media manager for a more business to business type gig in an effort to get away from the agency life but there really isn't much upward movement at my current position and I'd imagine outside of agencies in general it's a bit more limited unless you're at a huge corporation with a large marketing team ... or a smaller one that requires taking on multiple roles (and often a big pay cut.)I would recommend having some diverse marketing skills beyond social media - especially if interested in a specific field. I'd imagine we can expand into more digital marketing, PR, content creation, writing, etc.. It just gets a bit hard the higher up you go in the experience levels since those positions often look for a wider  or very specific skill set. It's actually kind of frustrating. WHERE do we go when we can't bring ourselves to learn about and really don't care about the next hot social media network that the kidz are into? #I've worked in two Digital Marketing agencies and now an SEO Contractor / Freelancer.Some people love being a ""jack of all trades"" while other's are pretty stoked at being the ""expert"" and go to guy in one specific discipline.From my personal experience, the director of the two agencies always looked for people with a broad set of skills in digital marketing (link building, local seo, enterprise seo, content development, social etc).  It's funny though because soon after they hired that person, they'd find out the ONE thing they were best at, encouraged them to take courses, learn more and more about that ONE thing and become the expert and go to guy for that specific type of marketing.So even though my directors hired people with a broad set of skills, they preferred each of us to only work on one technique (ie. social media).I'd say if you want to climb the ranks, I'd take advantage of any in house training, job shadowing, udemy and keep you eye on groupon's for other courses relating to all disciples in digital marketing.I did that and here I am starting my own SEO agency, offering a full range of digital marketing services.#>and should be working, not pissing around on reddit.They could ask the same question on LinkedIn but it'd be unlikely to see any decent response there.#If you care to, can you expand on your current role and your past digital analytics role? I took over the analytics (and, recently, the ad operations) at my current company while still doing social and I'm wondering where the heck I go from here. Social, ad ops, and analytics used to be three separate jobs and now the last two are also mine. I sometimes wonder if I'll even appeal to future employers since my role isn't solely social media. Hearing that you've transitioned your social/community management role into a career in analytics is definitely inspiring. #I've done the same Apprenticeship (I think), and whilst I specialise in Social I make myself useful in other areas like content, email etc. I'm just aiming to round myself as a Digital expert rather than just Social, despite it being my speciality. #Currently, I am looking to build the analytics and data capabilities within a new strategy department at an agency that is diversifying its product offering.I think the best advice I could give anyone would be to learn as much as you can - there are plenty of courses out there.udemy.com and codeacademy can teach you a lot. The more stuff you can do that an off the shelf tool can't, the more valuable you will be.Personally, I wouldn't worry about diversifying your roll... id actively encourage it. It broadens your knowledge base.I would also recommend that you hold yourself and agency/client to account. Most of the things measured on social aren't valuable KPI's, but diagnostic metrics. Learn the difference and make sure you focus on achieving the latter.   #Oh okay, that does make more sense to be honest. On the side I'm running @footbaiionly on Twitter which is helping me a lot for things like affiliate sign ups and driving app installs. Really recommend growing a social account of your own."
statistics;3vewfe;1449235939.0;/r/statistics/comments/3vewfe/i_am_interested_in_big_data_so_what_should_i/;I am interested in big data, so what should i focus on?;Hello, i am a student who study the secound year on the Statistics and Data analysis programme, which is 3 years, and on my last year i have room for extra courses, so i can basically choose whatever course i want (within data mining, data analysis etc.)I have studied R, SaS enterprises and databases. So my question to you guys is, what program is most used in handling big data? Or is there different theories and methods?;"The term ""big data"" is sort of a catch-all buzz word for a really wide variety of research areas, from genomics to social networks.  The methodologies are very diverse and there are all kinds of interesting things to work on.Are there any specific topic areas that appeal to you?  That might be a good place to start focusing your studies.My own suggestions are very much based on my background, and others might disagree.  First, I'd recommend getting familiar with python.  Keep up your R chops, but forget about spending any more time with SAS.I'd also recommend picking up some machine learning expertise and some background in variable selection procedures.  (The latter in particular is very important for working with large data sets.)Lastly, I'd suggest getting familiar with methods for handling missing data, and some basic background in causal inference.  (The two topics kind of go hand-in-hand.)  You'll probably end up encountering a lot of very messy data sets, and you'll want to have some tools to help get you out of trouble.Good luck!#Since the majority of your time in a job would likely be spent on finding/cleaning data and (potentially) automating your models, I'd say anything that gets really hands on with bad data and then some CS classes.I never had the opportunity to take CS classes during my PhD so I learn on the fly/take online courses for them now.#Python, R, SQL, Spark #What do you mean by *big data*? The narrow definition is ""data that won't fit on one computer"". This is actually still pretty rare, so I'm assuming you use the term *big data* to refer to what was until recently called applied statistics.If so, don't focus on a specific program, work on fundamentals instead. Logistic regression is logistic regression whether you do it in SAS, R, SPSS, Python, or Julia. You most likely will need SQL and some basic knowledge of programming, but more important is exposure to key CS concepts like asymptotic complexity and basic algorithms.#Do all the exercises at www.SQLzoo.net to build up your confidence in SQL. I swear to good it will be time very well invested if there's even the smallest chance you end up working with data. #CS#Take a look at Drew Conway's data science Venn diagram.http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram#Honestly - I work in Big Data and I really wish I knew Java better. It's the foundation of MapReduce and even Scala runs on the JVM so that means Spark  also has lots of Java.Also my shitty software dev skills means I suck at automating tools in Python and so on.I wrote a custom reducer for Hive in AWK last week though, that was pretty sweet.#C/C++, Java, map Redoop, HIVE, PIG, SQL. duhh#I do not really know what kind of topic that would appeal to me, but i am generally interested in medical statistics. I have been looking in to Python, and to lay down SAS, is it because it is not that popular anymore? (fyi. i really do not enjoy working in SAS)Is there some speciefic method? Well first of all i am only through 50% of the programme it might pop up something.Thank you!#This is the correct answer. In most jobs as a data scientist/analyst/etc.., you will spend a good chunk (if not a majority) of your time collecting and cleaning data.In addition to a few data-management/CS classes, OP may get a lot of good experience contributing to a software project with instrumentation, data-organization, exposing basic BI dashboards with basic statistics/regressions/graphs. Then once securing the basics, then OP can think about exposing more advanced statistics or results from some simple-ish ML models (e.g., a classification model for types/counts of users of this software). With a project like that on a resume, OP should have no trouble finding 'real' work. #Lol, one of those don't belong. Hint, has something to do with light#I do not really know what i exactly mean with it either.. The term is new to me and i am looking it up as much as can. But i have heard a lot of fuzz about it at the University.I know all the basic statistical methods and just recently learn about the logistic regression and i am looking in to Python.But i will definitely look in to SQL.Thank you!#Check out graduate programs in biostatistics and bioinformatics!Python is a nice language for many reasons.  I actually prefer R for a lot of the stuff I do.  Sadly, R is woefully inadequate when it comes to dealing with large data sets.  SAS is still very popular in some circles, but it's a dinosaur.  It is not a good platform for serious data exploration or methods development.Honestly, I'm surprised at all the CS recommendations.  Like I said, big data is very diverse.  I really value statistical methods and I'm a lousy programmer.  Other folks would take the opposite position.Try to find some people who are working on stuff that interests you!  Just google ""big data"" and ""medical statistics"" and go from there.  See what software tools they use, what they studied at school, stuff like that.  Then you can start to figure things out.  And get some research experience asap!#Any good online sources for dealing with bad/missing data?"
msp;3x1onm;1450245441.0;/r/msp/comments/3x1onm/client_wants_their_data_on_the_cloud/;Client wants their data on the cloud;"Hey MSP,I have a client who has about 10TB of data and wants to move it ""off site"". I am a new MSP so I dont have a colo and my office has a slow 10/1 connection, so it's out of the question.They have a drobo 5n in RAID 5 but are worried that if the drobo crashes, then they lose their data. Makes sense, so we setup Crashplan Proe and started moving their data to the cloud. At the rate of about 3-7 Mbps, it's gonna take about a year to complete lol. They are asking for a faster solution but I dont know what to provide. They dont have a server, just a bunch of workstations. They are a design company so dont have or need a domain and work with Macs. I wanted to put a synology on their end, copy the data from the drobo to it, then put another synology, copy the data to it as well, take the second synology to my office (or a friend's colo space) and just replicate it. I started researching Storagecraft after searching this sub but I cant figure out what's the best way to approach this. I feel like this is going to be a huge market as well - moving big data to the cloud - and want to find a good way of making this work.";"So some of this depends on what we're really talking about.  It's 10 TB, but is that a relatively small number of huge files, or a very large number of small files?  How often are those files updated?When they say they want to ""move it off-site"", does it need to be moved, or just copied?  Are they looking to remove equipment that's onsite, or do they just want a backup?  Do they want it ""in the cloud"" because they expect to access it remotely, or do they just want it out of their office?  Does the data all need to be updated, or is some of it archival?Not having answers, I can tell you that 10TB is unfortunately of a size where lots of things are going to break.  CrashPlan doesn't handle that volume of data well.  Any service with a 2-way sync is going to have trouble keeping up with changes, and it takes time just to rescan 10 TB and see what has changed.So first, I'd look for non-technical solutions.  Do they really need all of that data, or is some of it made up of people's iTunes libraries, or videos they downloaded from Bittorrent, or what?  Lots of businesses that I've dealt with, even if it's all legitimate data, they may be keeping 20 copies of the same files for no good reason.  Or there may be old files that they don't actually *need* to keep.  So get rid of what you can.  Next, look to see if some of it can be archived.  Do they have files from 8 years ago that nobody uses, but they're keeping just in case?  Find a place to store that stuff, e.g. dump it to a hard drive, make a couple of copies of that hard drive, and store the copies in different places.  Something like that.#Huh, it looks like Crashplan used to have a seed service. You'd pay $125, get shipped a 1TB HDD, fill it up, then mail it back. I'd try contacting them to see if you can work something like that out. It doesn't seem to be available anymore. #Is this really just for archival data?  If so, Amazon Glacier with one of their seeding devices is the way to go.#Sounds like archive to me.   Have them move expired project data.   Archive that to a separate device, or glacier.   Then see how much data you really have to actively backup.   I'd bet their active project data is less than 1tb.#""Client wants their data in the cloud"" or ""client wants their data off-site""?With that much data, and depending on the rate of change, you might be better off with a service that will physically come and pick up your backup devices on a regular basis and store them in a secure facility, instead of trying to send it out over the WAN.#Have you thought about AWS?https://aws.amazon.com/importexport/pricing/There are some huge benefits when you use S3 along with versioning and lifecycle(moving to glacier after a set period of time).#What you need is an offsite solution that will allow you to send them a physical seed of the data.Datto does this with Roundtrip drives, but trying to get 10TB of data backed up would be insanely expensive. I think this is going to be the route you're going to have to go though, you'll definitely want an onsite backup and an offsite. If the offsite solution you choose allows seeding of data, then you can backup the data to a local device and ship them the backup data.#Crashplan, I believe has the option where they send you a blank drive, you copy your data onto it, then send it to them. Once it's up you just sync the changes since the copy job.#Can you clarify- does your client want a cloud File Server type solution or do you just want a cloud backup?#I wonder why they have 10TB of data and no real serious infrastructure.  Most companies that get to that point realize that they have a serious need that needs some serious investment and thought.  The hard part about 10TB, wherever it is, is that it is hard to backup, move, restore, or pretty much do anything with monolithically.Are they just looking to move offsite for backups or for access as well?  In any case, you may have to try to logically break up that data.  Also, get them off of the Drobo, that is just asking for it.  They need real hardware.  Anyone running 10TB of data in RAID 5 is walking a really thin line.#If it's archive/dr type stuff - look into Xilocore.I've had nothing but good experiences with them and they are well worth the per-gig cost.#Thank you very much. This is something I will also consider. I have to sit and discuss with them what data they should ""archive"" and just drop that on a USB and move offsite and just backup the stuff they access to offsite. I've been looking at this all wrong. I'm looking at moving TB of storage to the cloud, but I think moving archiving offsite and then just having 2 way sync with the data that's being used frequently would be a better option.#I've looked into glacier, and I think moving previous projects and archived data to it will be the best option... except I've never done it before.#Interesting, I'll definitely consider the option and ask the client if they will be willing #Thanks, I have sent an email. Waiting for a response.#Cloud backup mainly. They want to access the data off the lan, but just want to know their data is safe offsite#Well they have reached that point I guess and they are reaching out for solutions. Like many have said, I should break down what are the archives and what are the actual files used and make sure to backup the archives to aws or an offsite storage first.#Real Estate agents / property managers. They'll consume as much space as they can with photos and not even bat an eye lid.#Never even heard of them. Thanks, I'll check it out. #I'll warn you, it's definitely a chunk of change. Something like $1500 for an on-site appliance to sync back to their DCs, plus the monthly storage fee (I think it's something like 50 cents per gig), but they are fantastic at what they do.I've had them courier physical disks from Nevada to California to meet recovery SLAs."
datascience;3w8nlf;1449764373.0;/r/datascience/comments/3w8nlf/coursera_data_science_specializations_john/;Coursera Data Science Specializations - John Hopkins Data Sci vs. UCSD Big Data;"Disclaimer - I don't have a formal CS degree but learned programming through grad school (data analytics in social science) and an immersion program. And yes - a thoughtful Reddit user informed me I left off the ""S"" on Johns in the title. Amended below though :-) .I've been work as a platform dev for approx 18 months writing a blend of Python and Java code. Most of my work focuses on picking up data from third party APIs, sticking it into our data pipeline, and pulling it out with Python to serve up for our web app after it's been fed into the various MapReduce jobs we have to format the data into the shape we need. What do I want to do in the future?I want to understand how to build models to derive insights from data, knowing how to clean it, work with data at scale, identify holes in data sets, and essentially work efficiently with data. With a background in social science research I'm inclined towards working in a space where non-profit meets data, but I'm comfortable working within the more traditional technical space provided it's within the realms of ""data engineering"" (as I understand it).What I'm trying to do -Outside of networking, finding folks in the community who do work I may be interested in, I want to pursue learning to help fill in the gaps. I may (mostly likely) invest in another grad program down the line once I've defined my career goals more specifically. MOOC therefore provide an attractive option for me.Johns Hopkins Data Sci specialization and the UCSD Big Data specialization are two course listings that pop out to me. It appears to me the former may be more academically minded whereas the latter is more professional minded. True or not, I'm at a crossroads as to which one to pursue. I have a strong background in Python and have worked in R - not caring for it entirely. The JH track is R only and most reviews say the content is quite introductory at best. Does anyone have any insight for what may be better? I'm not looking to move into the academic space but wish to use the specialization to help me in professional development.";"There's an extremely high likelihood that someone did not take both courses, because once they completed one -- they moved on and started doing projects or deeper learning.I'd ask for feedback from people who've taken the courses themselves and try to make an informed decision.With that said, when I started looking for jobs a few months ago, I had 109 interviews in 2 months. Not a single person asked me what specific courses I took (my resume does have quantitative and programming skills on there), not a single one asked what papers I wrote nor published in grad school. You know what every one asked: Tell me about/Walk me through one of your favorite projects.Talking about the data collection, the cleaning, the modeling, the relationship building, and the implentation...that's what people care about. People always want to know How does what you've done apply to me? How does it make my team better or more efficient? How can you help solve our problems?Classes are a decent foundation, but they won't give you a job. You spend a quarter of your time learning new things on the job anyways. My advice, watch a few videos from each. Figure out which learning style helps things stick more and take the course. Then find a pet project or kaggle competition that interests you and go to town.#I would also look at the Portilla course on Udemy. There is probably a code floating around for $10-20. Would build off of your Python background. #I've commented on the JHU specialization in other threads. The short version I'll write here is that it seems directed at beginner programmers who want to capitalize on the boom in big data hiring. I doubt you'd get much out of it.The statistical inference class is pretty good if you haven't taken stats before. The videos are very theoretical, which is good if you want to get into academia.Otherwise, it's mostly how to do a lot of different things in R.#Commenting on the JHU course:Targeted at beginners definitely. Depending on how easily you can switch between languages, the r programming course may or may not be worth it. Reading your post, I would recommend:R programming course (don't pay for it)Getting and cleaning data (don't pay for it)Those two will give you a super quick crash course in R. You can probably knock them out in a week or two if motivated. For taking it to the next level:Statistical inference. Depending on your comfort level and familiarity with stats - this will set the stage for a lot of basic knowledge you'll be applying later on. Machine learning. Again, the goal is to get a 10,000 foot overview of the techniques and mentality. You will get more direction on how to accomplish a task. The other classes aren't bad - but depending on how familiar you are with git, general analytical mentality and visualizing data - they may not add much immediate value. #*Johns (it was his mother's maiden name)#one looks more expensive.#[deleted]#I've read a Naive Bayes white paper, wrote my own implementation using a Kaggle in the class room dataset, and went through it in two different talks. I'm definitely planning on building my own data set for this when I have some free time during the holidays, thanks for the suggestions!#How did you get all those interviews? I've had like four in a year, despite a pretty solid background in math, programming, and data analysis. Do you have a PhD?#how about this course? https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-science-analytics-context#This is so helpful - thank you!!#Do you recommend taking it out of order even if one is a beginner? #Thanks :-)#You can do the classes for free and even then the price point (if I opted to do that) for this isn't terrible for me.#That sounds great - would love to move this conversation offline. Will shoot you a message!#Master's Degree (I was in a PhD where 3/200 were accepted into the program, but recruited after Masters).Organizational Psychology shows that HR & recruiters in there split second decision/review of resumes look at 1. education history 2. current and previous organization and 3. current and previous job title.My advice is to fine a job/internship that has data/analytics/data science/etc. in the title or ask your boss to revise your title to data scientist. Data Science operates on the same Catch-22 as 'manager' title. Until you've been a manager it's very difficult to get a managerial job. Become a manager once and everyone wants you as a manager.#Oh - as for how.. a mix of talking with recruiters via linkedin (they tend to reach out pretty frequently), direct applying to jobs at companies I'd want to work out (e.g. Google doesn't post to Indeed), applying to indeed/linkedin jobs (I made a saved job string that updated me daily and I could add to excel file to apply to).Oh I also really like angellist. It's a website for startups from VC to Series C funding (so 1-a few hundred people). I've met great people on there, done hourly consulting for some as a mentorship type role, and have a couple that I've considered for a job as I plan to start my own company in about 2.5 years.#The stats in the first course looks solid, but pretty shallow. The most useful material is statistical inference, and that just lists it as ""Intro to..."" But if you haven't taken any stats or probability before, it looks like a good overview of a lot of topics.The second course doesn't have a syllabus, which probably means they haven't written one yet. Of the six bullet points listed, the last one is ""Basic and frequently used algorithms"" which doesn't sound very promising. Still, I'm reserving judgement until they get the syllabus out.The third course: I don't know much about the Internet of Things, so it's hard to say. No syllabus here either. Bit of a mystery of a course. Could be a gateway to a fascinating new field, could be superficial and dull.Overall, it's hard to say how this compares to other programs  it's different but in the same vein. The various topics could at least give a person an idea of what they could be passionate about and where to explore on their own.Additionally, I don't see where it says what language they'll be using. To me, that says programming isn't a big component, which I'd take as a negative, but maybe it is.#Everyone's comfort level is different. As a fairly quick test, if you rated your programming experience and general stats knowledge as low, take them in order. If you are used to switching between programming languages then taking them out of order won't be too much of a problem. "

cscareerquestions;3uy5hu;1448939972.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3uy5hu/apple_or_amazon/;Apple or Amazon?;I'm having a hard time deciding between the two offers. Maybe someone here can offer some help. Which job would you choose?My compare and contrast of the two jobs. Just me thinking out loud, feel free to ignore what's below, or point out where I'm wrong if you do read it.Apple job is doing embedded systems. Low level, C/C++ programming, which is what my background is in. Got the feel that it would be a good place to develop my technical skills. Amazon job is more about distributed systems, services and big data. All in Java. Which is very trendy right now. Feel like something that's good to learn about and would enable me to develop some good business understanding of things.Both are in tech centers. Apple in Bay Area, Amazon in Seattle. Seattle has the advantage of lower taxes, COL and generally better living conditions. From what I hear, I prefer Seattle as a city to live in. And I could picture myself living in Seattle long term, not the case for Bay Area.Know little about work life balance in Apple. Amazon doesn't have a good reputation here. I want to take a job where I feel I can keep working there for a long time without burning out. On this aspect, I feel Apple is slightly better.In terms of future career progression, I feel either job would be fairly good. I feel Amazon is better in that the skills developed there is more general, so could be used in lots of other roles at other companies. Where the technical skills I can develop at Apple would be very good for future roles in low level development.They offer fairly even amounts in term of money. Apple is better when it comes to benefits. Amazon is not too bad after considering COL and taxes.;"Both offers seem pretty good for you. It's honestly hard to tell you which one to go for, as I think you'll do well in both. How are the teams for the two companies? Can you leverage your offers to negotiate a higher compensation at one of these companies? Maybe these two factors can sway your decision.#They're actually very similar once you go below the surface: secretive/introspective, with a cult of management/personality centering around the God Emperor CEO (though perhaps much less so for Apple now that Jobs is gone--maybe Jony Ive is that person now  dunno). Of course, that sort of culture also leads to excessive working hours (in general), and both companies are known for it, in truth, though there are sizable pockets of sanity in both. You just don't hear as much about Apple because...lawyers? Stronger cult mentality? Stronger sense of work purpose/fulfillment? It actually does suck less in other ways that count? Can't say for sure.As a company, Amazon (+AWS) is very much on the rise at the moment  Apple is stagnating a bit and may well have peaked without their God Emperor. These things can change, of course--Apple was approaching death twenty years ago and Amazon didn't really exist in any meaningful way. Now they're bigger (in terms of revenue, at least) than just about everybody else on the planet.So, really, it comes down to the city you prefer and the direction you want to take your career in with respect to skills/tech stack/domain. All else is trivial.P.S. I worked at Amazon for a few years and actually did like it quite a bit, but there was nothing about the greater company that inspired me to make a career of it. My team was a senior-laden group in R&D and I was an experienced (mid-level) hire with a lot of visibility into what I was getting into--so on a personal level, I did cool stuff and got paid well for it, with decent hours. College hires who get blindly shunted off to shit teams that are supporting legacy code, a brutal on-call rotation, and a pointy-haired first line manager with something to prove generate most of the horror stories. Plus those poor saps in the warehouses, though I hear they still pay a hell of a lot better than Wal-Mart. Good luck!#Depends on which specific team you are joining on Amazon. The general consensus is that it's either very good or very bad.#My SO interned at Apple last summer. He enjoyed the work, but the culture wasn't for him. It was all very secretive and he had a lot of issues with that - being in the Bay Area, you'll likely want to go to conferences or workshops or hackathons and Apple frowns on that (at least at the internship level). He was also working around 50 hours a week because his manager was crazy and super high pressure (he has a lot of issues with his manager, as did other FTEs on his team but that's another story...). He felt that you really have to be passionate about the work because of this culture. But his roommates loved working at Apple and are going back, so he thinks he just got unlucky.#depends on whether you want to go into embedded#Seem pretty even overall.

jobs;3wyn58;1450199874.0;/r/jobs/comments/3wyn58/need_advice_trying_to_decide_between_a_current/;Need advice: Trying to decide between a current Lead DevOps position and lower-grade Field Engineer position with lots of travel. Which is more risky in long term - trying to grow into a job you dont like or going into a job with less promotion opportunities?;So im 37 now , i worked for the past few years in various forms of Field Engineering positions for some Telecom-related companies, got to travel around the world ,including some weird places (Mongolia,Zimbabwe)    A few months ago i was offered an opportunity to move into a DevOps lead position on an RND team in some other company,which i took .     This is quite a bit higher on the hierarchy of things, and i got quite a substantial pay raise.     So ive been on this job for about 6 months now and im completely sick of it. RND is so much different from Field/Support/Customer facing departments, the day-to-day of the job is boring , and typically there is no freedom to make clever work arounds, theres lots of documentation to be made and theres no travel   I've been offered a Field Engineer job now, which will pay the same or a bit less as im being paid now ,but is not as senior technically,but involves a lot of travelso current job's pros are: senior position,pretty advanced product (big data) ,rnd title field job pros are: more dynamic (i.e. theres always some new unexpected troubles popping up that demand immediate solutions), less paperwork, and lots of travel.what would you do ?     i'm kinnda 50/50 and im lost :(     ;"Only you can make a decision like this, but your post sounds like you're desperate to take the FE job and want someone to talk you in to it.  So, I'll say ""take the FE job"".  #Do what makes you happy now.#Yeah that's about it  I'm just looking for the why not part really, that I'm probably missing    But, thanks :) #That's the kind of non adult thinking I'm afraid I'm getting myself into#I don't know anything about telecoms or field engineering, but it's true that devops is a big field right now, so you might consider the merits of sticking it out in your current job and then finding a devops job that doesn't suck.  Try to answer the question ""do I hate devops jobs, or do I hate this devops job?"".  But like I said, it sounds like you really want to return to FE work, and other than ""not as senior technically"" I don't see the downside.# I really like to travel   Last 6 months I been going to the same office and I'm kinnda depressed   I know it's a super first  world problem, but here I am :(  Got hard case of wanderlust #If you don't have kids, I say go for it.  If you do, I say go for it if you can figure out a way that this won't be too much of a burden on your family.  Good luck!"

hadoop;3vyln5;1449599337.0;/r/hadoop/comments/3vyln5/question_do_you_use_or_know_about_vmware_bde/;Question: do you use, or know about VMware BDE, virtualized Hadoop. Also announcing the new BDE 2.3 release.;"Hi guys,I am support engineer for VMware, and until recently I was part of the Storage/DR team and then moved to the ""Data Management"" team.We focus on multiple products, but the one product that brings me here is BDE, or Big Data Extensions, we just released the latest version, 2.3. The official announcement is here: https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2015/12/whats-new-in-vsphere-big-data-extensions-version-2-3.htmlI wanted to see if anyone is actually using this here, or if you even know about it, and if you want to do a quick test drive in the [Hands-on-Labs  ](http://labs.hol.vmware.com/) (Search for BDE, or LAB HOL-SDC-1609, unfortunately, this is based on an older release).Let me know your questions, and I will do my best to answer.Thank you.";What does it do?#Question, are you using shared storage or local storage here? In my experience your IO will bottleneck if shared, and the cluster doesn't have to be that big to saturate the pipe. How easy is it to leverage local disk here?We took a workload off a 200 node virtualized cluster and ran it on a 10 node physical and the 10 node physical with local storage beat the pants off the 200 node shared storage virtual setup.#Short version: automagically provision/create a Hadoop cluster in a VM environment based on your specifications.How we do it:1. You build a spec file with what roles/groups and how many of each you want2. We provide a Linux template, or you can build one yourself.3. The software clones virtual machines (VMs), provisions whatever software you need on them, or hand them over to an application manager (Ambari, ClouderaManager...etc) to do so.4. Extra features: because this is a virtual environment, we can scale in/out (increase/decrease the number of machines in a cluster) or scale up/down (increase/decrease CPU/memory/storage) of existing VMs.A short Youtube demo is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMG1QlS6yagAnd using Ambari via the CLI:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TOEdnXNt2MCloudera:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doOCAQNSgeUI hope this helps.#Both. Either. Your choice really.Our recommendation is to use shared storage for the OS disks and local storage for HDFS datanode disks.When configuring BDE, you select which datastores (VMFS) will be used, and you can assign a configuration to each (LOCAL or SHARED).We have setups where the customer is using Isilon OneFS for HDFS (I don't really agree with the concept of centralized HDFS, but whatever the customer wants), and in that case, they deploy everything as a compute-only cluster and HDFS is completely external to VMware.We also have customers that deploy the whole thing on VSAN, but this is strictly for testing and prototyping, as VSAN's replication kills performance for HDFS. (This is what I use in my lab, performance is NOT my concern)200->10 seems quite...I don't even know what word to use here, and I agree that our filesystem is not the best for this type of workload, hence our recommendation.Oh, interesting username btw.-nick#This is expected.  When you're using a virtualized infrastructure you'll usually do 1 VM per host and give all the local drives to the VM.  This gets you as close to bare metal as possible while still getting the advantages of the VM management environment.  A better pattern I'm starting to see is running Ambari and a all of the head node services (minus nn and rm) on VM clusters so they can quickly shift around in the event of failure, and using bare metal for the dn/nm/supervisor/region etc.  This works ok for the small to mid size clusters.#I am sure you can increase the performance of shared storage with enough investment but the whole idea behind Hadoop is to keep cost and overhead low. I am glad that you have the option of using local disk. It's typically much cheaper to completely destroy a node and spin up new nodes. Next up is the investment in fabric interconnect is quite important to satisfy high throughput data movement while also optimizing to minimize movement of data if that makes sense. Pros/Cons of different approaches. At the end of the day just support multiple kinds of setups easily which would be a huge selling point of your solution, which it seems like you do!Even when using Spark, if we are having to batch data off HDFS as opposed to streaming there can be bottlenecks. If pure streaming the impact can be less noticeable between local and shared as well as physical and virtual. I have also seen CPU scheduling issues when virtualized, then again that just comes down to simple sizing 101 and making sure you have enough cycles to not run into scheduling issues.Thanks for the user name. I made it when someone really pissed me off. : )#I'm actually seeing something different. [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org) and containers. I see with VMs a lot of people go down the SR-IOV route but you also give up some things. In a lot of cases VMs are unnecessary IMO with all the other tools that already exist. At the end of the day you have choices and you can do something like Mesos with VMz and have containers but at what point are there too many layers of abstraction?#What were the specs like for the 200 nodes vs the 10?I have seen some interesting reports around the IP that VMware has and its I/O optimization being superior to Linux so that if you compare a physical host to that same host with just 4 VMs running on it the VMs outperform.http://www.mellanox.com/pdf/case_studies/VMW-Hadoop-Performance-vSphere5.pdfShared storage should not be looked at from a performance perspective but can provide some interesting alternative benefits if you are looking at reducing footprint or creating a backup/DR copy#Once you hit acceptable manageability, there's no point of abstracting further.  The biggest Hadoop clusters in production are all bare metal around head and data nodes, so that should be the default.#Running virtual is not more optimized from an IO perspective than physical. I have seen this in the wild many times over. The best one can hope to achieve is 0 overhead or the same performance. It's another layer. If you are worried about IO performance in a virtual environment, then you can make some tradeoffs and look to leverage [SR-IOV](https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-51/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc%2FGUID-CC021803-30EA-444D-BCBE-618E0D836B9F.html).Btw, the 200 node cluster was on Amazon AWS and it ran much faster on 10 physical nodes architected for Hadoop workloads. I should have mentioned cloud to go along with virtual, although Amazon is xen based.#I 100% agree with you!!! The idea that we have to virtualize everything because that's our standard is absurd. Creating a VM that is the same size as the underlying physical machine has to be one of the worst practices ever. What's the point?For production machines where the apps don't have redundancy or DR built in, I love VMware. I love live migration and all that but I don't think it's a one size fits all solution. Now, if I am VMware of course I am going to do things like this to try and make VMware as applicable as I can. But in my experience I like to use it where it makes sense. POC clusters for functional testing? Sure.
gis;3wo4i7;1450028464.0;/r/gis/comments/3wo4i7/im_creating_an_infographic_the_world_in_2050_will/;"I'm creating an infographic ""The world in 2050 will be better with Geography"" ... Here is a preview of the design. Right now I have points on Urban Geography and Big Data analysis. Can you guys suggest some more ways 2050 will be better because of GIS?";;I key thing people in my GIS-view keep saying is that location will become as ubiquitous in computers as time currently is. Things will change for the better with that, perhaps around 2050 it will start being so (hard to predict any technology though!)As a programmer I know every programming language has at least one function to return the current time, which you get from the clock. You don't have to think about it. There will also be a bunch of functions, like is X closer than Y, and ways to save a time stamp. Now most devices have a location (rather than they take up a whole location/room). There are some common functions to get the location. On my Android phone I often have multiple GPS-focused apps running (GPS Essentials for checking signal and recording a track  Keypad Mapper 3 for recording OSM data  Mapillary for instead recording photo sequences) but they all have to get the location from Android separately, and they decide to do this at different rates. Oddly this will result in different levels of detail in the recordings from them and a lot of battery charge taken by the processing from it. Devices will realise everything wants to know the location, so it will be focused on efficently providing the location, in a form that all the apps understand.#You might poke around in the materials from the two editions of this event: http://www.geography2050.org#**Also note: The point of this is sort of to look at changes predicted to happen in the future, and then show how Geography can play a critical role in those changes. Also, full disclosure, I am creating this infographic as a class assignment, but I also just think the finished product would be a great addition to the community. I'm just looking for more ideas and maybe some extra sources I can look in to!#[deleted]#Remote sensing. Better, cheaper, bigger, quicker data allowing for active monitoring of the planet.#>...location will become as ubiquitous in computers as time currently is.I think this is important to understand for those pursuing GIS as a career. One of the most popular web mapping applications used today, Leaflet, was written by a programmer with no GIS education. In the end it's all just math, vectors, geometry, etc. As spatial information becomes more ubiquitous, so too will tools for the everyday user to view, query and manipulate this data. Be careful that you don't land in the same position as word processing clerks in the 80's who saw using Word Perfect as a career path. The term GIS may not survive until 2050 (it's hard enough to explain now already).#Here's what I have. I don't really like my second point very much thoughPredictions: 1.	“No home, no car, no problem”: As millennial generations mature, less and less importance is put on these ancient values. Thirty years ago Americans dreamed of the suburbs where they could own a car, a house and a white picket fence. In 30 years more importance will be put on public transportation and affordable flats. (Anderson) 2.	Robotic production beats human production: As technologies improve and become cheaper to use, remaining human-production will be forced to learn technical operation or be out of a job. (Kelly) 3.	Bigger Data: Estimates indicate that 90% of the data we use today was only created in the past few years, imagine what we will have in 30. (Wall)  Geography’s role: 1.	This is a huge area for geography in the sense of urban &amp  spatial planning as well as sustainable cities / housing. This is right up our alley. 2.	This is a significant economic and cultural shift that geography can help model and prepare for. We can locate areas most likely to be affected and help by attempting to provide support &amp  alternative jobs. 3.	This is an opportunity for geographers in spatial science and statistics. Geographers excel at taking complex data and presenting it in a way that people can understand.

How would giving them exponentially more hay make them able to find the needle better?I became curious... Could having *more* raw data unintuitively make the data easier to analyze?  Wouldn't it make outliers and extremes stick out more, and trends more apparent?  I only work with structured data so I am conceptually unfamiliar with big data analysis. Cheers!;Yeah! Read up on semi-supervised learning. The basic idea is large amounts of unlabeled data (not sure what you mean by unstructured) data helps you understand and model the distribution of data. That then informs your modeling of the labels of the thing you do care about.#It is also true that many forms of data both structured and unstructured are very sparse.  So more data can clearly help when you are trying to get enough cases that connect two or more sparse events.#I've always wondered how much low level regulation there is in the tools the CIA/NSA/etc can use. I work in credit ratings and we're constrained from using anything other than logistic regression for most credit scoring models due to regulations surrounding documentation. So, while a neural net or other machine learning method might work for our application we can't actually use it. I wonder if they have the same problem.#Thanks! Why is unstructured the wrong terminology? I add thought emails, voice data, text, etc are all 'unstructured' / raw#Careful with terminology. Data can be structured and unlabeled at the same time. #Of course. However the OP read to me as being about unlabeled data, not unstructured data. Needles in haystacks, outliers and extremes, trends are all things I would associate with structured data that's unlabeled.

I'd love to learn it to be able to sufficiently analyse big data sets.Thanks!;"The mailing list is extremely helpful if you know the basics.#If you are new to programming then learning the basics of programming in general is important. There are resources on Coursera and other places that teach a lot of how to use R, and Google can help you find what libraries you need to download/functions to use for different types of regressions/hypothesis testing.The best way to learn how to write code is to write code. Grab some data sets you might want and do some tests.R is a pretty nice language to start out with, with the whole ""user to programmer"" or whatever the whole philosophy was behind it. You can do most of what you want with very intuitive syntax and start to do more and more complex stuff as you become more proficient.Getting an R kernel for Jupyter would be a good place to start getting yourself set up.One thing you'll want to keep in mind if you are dealing with large data sets is to look into preallocation of memory. I know when I first started using R I sat for like 10 hours for my code to run because I was an idiot and forgot to preallocate.#I'm learning R right now too. There are a bunch of great resources out there but I find myself going back to MarinStatsLectures on Youtube. I love how I can go and watch a quick video to remind myself how to do something. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqzoL9-eJTNBDdKgJgJzaQcY6OXmsXAHU"

I've got a combination of different mutual funds and stocks, for which I do sporatic contributions.My question is how do I measure my portfolios compound annual growth rate (CAGR) when I've made contributions throughout the year?For example:-If I haven't made any contributions, and my portfolio has grown from $10000 to $11000 in 2 years, then my CAGR = 4.9%-However, let's say that I start at $10000, and 1 month later it's at $9500 (ouch). At this point, I contribute $1000 (now at $10500), and 11 months later it's at $11000 (obviously we've invested in different things because the growth is different). How exactly do I measure this? After the first month, my CAGR is -46.0% (yikes), but in the time between my contribution and the end of the year, my CAGR is 17.3%.

jobs;3v1eib;1448998785.0;/r/jobs/comments/3v1eib/should_i_let_my_current_employer_know_about_a/;Should I let my current employer know about a contingent job offer?;I am a new grad as of May and have been working as a Software Developer (a mix of JEE dev and dev ops work) for a fortune 50 company since June and are pretty happy with my job. However, I recently came upon another job opportunity for a smaller firm who's focus is in security, big data analytics, and sigint on government contracts. I interviewed and loved the company and the work I'll be doing, and got a contingent offer. It is contingent on passing the proper security clearances, this could take anywhere from 6 to 14 months. As part of the clearance process my current manager will likely be interviewed. I am continuing to work at my current place of employment until I pass my clearances(I plan to stay here if my clearances don't go through) and haven't told them yet. So really my question is, how should I handle letting my current employer know that I'm looking into this other opportunity since they'll be interviewed? Should I notify them before hand or go the its better to ask for forgiveness than permission route?;I agree with the other comment. Keep this to yourself until you know they are going to interview your manager. I would also list someone else you work with that you trust as the interviewee instead of your direct manager. Once your manager finds out, it will be very awkward and/or you will be at risk for losing your current role.#You should notify your manager if they are going to interview them, otherwise you should tell no one. Telling your employer you're interviewing somewhere else and only staying at your current job because of forced waiting period is the equivalent to telling your employer that you're no longer an asset and that you should be terminated as soon as possible.  Unless this is one of those rare places that actually helps people advance their careers regardless of where they work, talking about going to work at other employers is not a good idea and should only be done when you're ready to leave immediately. #You're in an enviable position, but as others have noted I would stay mum for now until you have greater insight into the security clearance process and are solidly down that road.

This sounds more like an uneducated rant than a realistic case against Big Data hype (which I think most will agree exists on some scale). I would encourage the author to spend more time seeking to understand the applications of big data, contrasting previous solutions to current, and making note of decisions that are made on this 'fad' of big data and the impact of those decisions on both the business and human world at large. Since the writer self-professes they are neither actively nor passively involved in any big data projects- I would hardly consider them a valuable contributor to the conversation. #Another vapid rant from the Big Data Contrarian.

I was trying to write them in a single post before and it was too long and convoluted.I'm a first year Master's student interested in Big Data (I know it's a buzzword - bear with me). There were a variety of reasons I chose my school, but I knew going in a weakness in the program would be preparing me for the big data trend, so I know I need to learn what I want regarding ""big data"" on my own.I remember reading a thread on here quite some time back about how ""typical methods"" of model building become difficult with enormous data sets - in short my understanding at the time was that because the standard error of parameter estimates becomes so small in that case variable selection down to a more practical size becomes a challenge, although I guess you have the opportunity for high predictive power if model complexity isn't a concern.  I'm sure that's just one of many considerations as sample size gets dramatically large.In short, I just want to start learning about how to deal with data that has over a million observations, for example, since that's such a different beast from what I've been exposed to so far with class projects ranging from about 100-10,000 observations.Any resource suggestions are appreciated, but I guess I'm wondering about book recommendations in particular.  I don't necessarily want a proof-heavy textbook, but I also worry that most of the results from a ""big data"" search on Amazon are aimed at people with much less statistics background than me.  I guess I'm hoping to find something that does have an applied focus (I guess some theory thrown in is fine) but isn't simplified down to just intro stats level.Any suggestions?";"*Introduction to Data Mining* by Tan, Steinbach, and Kumar is pretty good. It covers a ton of different methods of analysis, from cleaning and anomaly detection to pattern analysis, visualization, and clustering.On a related note, big data is usually in reference to datasets that are so large that they cannot be analyzed on a single computer. So, a million rows usually doesn't make the cut, unless you've also got a ton of columns. If you want to learn how to handle big data, you should look into the programming side of things too, like MapReduce and Hadoop. I personally don't know enough about those to give you any reading materials, but they are important to learn. #There is a course being taught at my school about the ""Mathematics of Massive Data Analysis"" and the prof presents everything in the framework of spectral graph theory. We focussed a lot on using the Graph Laplacian to develop standard ideas in data analysis like clustering, k-means, etc. According to him, a good book on this topic does not really exist, because a lot of this material is still in the literature. Edit: I should say we didn't really talk about HOW to implement a lot of these solutions, but we really understood the basis for the method. If you want a good practical resource, try one of the Coursera/edX courses! #Thanks!"

I'm interested in big data analysis and machine learning, I know I'm likely not going to get a job directly doing this after 6 months of study, but I would like to at least get something that could build towards that as a career, not some webdev job doing ruby or whatever those bootcamps are doing nowadays.

First network installed in 1990, CCIE-R/S in 2000, JNCIE-SP in 2011... I have lost interest in furthering/maintaining that knowledge base where I'm working now because the requirements have drifted far away from what experience I brought with me.  I have also found myself in my first ever operations role and that is proving to be a poor fit.  I wonder if I should get myself out of operations before deciding my next growth step.  I'm spending more time trying to get the tools and automation to work in my hack corner case - and hounding the ones responsible for fixing them.  It has turned into BS. I think it is all about where you work and whether you're doing enough that interests you.  I'm trying to change that while leveraging my considerable networking experience and ability.  I'm looking to switch teams where I currently work because I'm vesting RSUs that were priced when the stock was 40% of what it is trading at today and I believe that they'll train me to fill in my gaps...  The trick is to get them to keep my pay at a senior network engineer level while I come in as less than senior in the new position.TLDR:  It may be your job that's boring, not network engineering itself.  Try finding something that leverages your existing knowledge and experience.#The silent majority are also offended.  #I wouldn't say offended.  It's a teachable moment for someone new to the field.

Met a lot of great people off there#Big data companies will always want you to be stronger at engineering, b/c dealing with large data sets is always partly an engineering problem.If you really don't want to do that, you either need to focus on academia, or on business intelligence/marketing data applications where most of the engineering problems come pre-solved. (Others might be able to suggest other fields in this category.)I'd vote for earning your stripes in pure software, though. A couple of years with that kind of experience, plus accreditation in ML/stats, will make you an appealing candidate for a lot of really interesting positions.Source: consulting data scientist  was a hiring manager while at one of the companies on that list.

DataHoarder;3uy24r;1448938669.0;/r/DataHoarder/comments/3uy24r/big_data/;Big Data;Ok, this is a bit hard for me to explain so ill do my best.Basically my parents machines are both Mac, and my Mums machine has crapped its self and i have tried everything to fix it short of spending any money on the issue as its something my parents dont want to do. Basically, im building a high power workstation as i personaly run quiet a few VMs and other things. My plan is to build this new machine a little earlier than expected and then just move my parents from mac to Windows using VMs. Ive done my research and found this shouldnt be an issue for what they do, the issue i have is the amount of data i need to store. Between me and my parents there is about 20-25 TB of data that needs to be storred. I want to know what the best way to do this might be. I had a thought about maybe having another machine that has the horsepower to host that much data and just have the two machines connected via a 10g link so there is no bottleneck of a 1g network. I want to know your guys opinions because it is quiet alot of data to be stored.I know the first thing you are all thinking, there has to be some data that can be deleted lower the spce requirements, the problem is we have already done that. My main concern is my prents data as most of mine isnt important and can be downloaded again if need be. My internet connection doesnt allow me to have stuff stored in the cloud (Yay for Aussie internet) and my parents really only use photo editing tools and occasional video editing.I want to know peoples opinions on both of my solutions (The one high powered station with the VMs on it connected by 10g to the other solution which is a high power storage server).Thanks in advanced.;"That amount of data isn't an issue as long as you get large enough hard drives to hold it (plus whatever you need for redundancy). Lots of people on this sub have setups that hold well over that size.Not really sure I understand your application. What are you running the VMs on? Are you actually doing big data applications, or is the data not operated on often?#My parents are photographers. So they are constantly editing and using photos. Its not that they are using large amounts at a time but they ""Need"" all that data stored for when they want to use it. I have a server 2012r2 license and i was planning to run the VMs on that. Have the VMs stored on SSDs locally on the main work station and then have all the storage they require connected via a 10g link so that there is not bottle neck when transferring files to and from.#>So they are constantly editing and using photos. Its not that they are using large amounts at a time but they ""Need"" all that data stored for when they want to use it.So, your focus should be on space, availability, and longevity, not performance. You don't need a lot of power for this type of server application unless you're running other services (ex. your parents RDP into the box and edit photos from there). >connected via a 10g link so that there is not bottle neck when transferring files to and fromThe network you've described will have a hard time consistently saturating a 1Gbps link, even during a large file transfer. A number of other bottlenecks will manifest before bandwidth becomes an issue. You're welcome to splurge on enterprise-grade network infrastructure, but you'd likely get more benefit from extra drive space/redundancy.>I have a server 2012r2 license and i was planning to run the VMs on that.Are you running Windows Server 2012 on the file server then?

MachineLearning;3v7gec;1449097014.0;/r/MachineLearning/comments/3v7gec/question_how_does_the_given_algorithm_incorporate/;[question] How does the given algorithm incorporate machine learning techniques??? (no code included, but there is a description);"   For a report (the final, big report we have in our ""big data"" class at my uni), we had to use Hadoop with a machine learning algorithm of our choice (random forest, L-SVM, etc). He had provided code for what he calls ""random forest with hadoop,"" and we were essentially supposed to simply modify this code to run with our dataset, and compare it to a version of the same code that doesn't incorporate Hadoop.    That being said, he gave us some R code with a mapreduce call in it and said basically, ""here is random forest with Hadoop, compare with a Hadoop-less version."" Since the class is moreso about Hadoop and HDFS than machine learning, I can't exactly tell whether this code actually does what random forest does. Without posting the code itself (afraid of copyright issues since it's in his textbook), I want to describe what some of this code does.    Random Forest (mapper):The mapper seems to be creating two bootstrap samples, combining them with rbind(), assigning the bootstrap sample index to the key and the combined samples themselves as the val.   RF (reducer): The reducer is where the code takes one feature--specified by the coder--and compares each entry in the  feature against the feature mean, assigning a class to that feature (either a 0 or 1 for his example), which I have modified to a feature in question for my dataset, and introduced one more possible class. The original feature values are then replaced with their assigned classes, and... That's it.    The rest of the code: The rest of the code is mine, and is only for the purpose of debugging: it takes the output, compares those assigned classes against the actual classes, and calculates ""information gain.""    The bootstrap samples are never used anywhere else in his code, no bagging is apparent, only one feature is used, and the metric by which that feature is classified is hard-coded and, seemingly, specific to that particular example dataset. No ""trees"" are made, and there is certainly no vote tally function for said trees' outputs.    The code that performs this function isn't supposed to be some incomplete ""fill-in-the-blanks"" type of situation  rather, it's straight out of a textbook he wrote on the subject that he is using as an example of code for random forest, to help describe how it works. I'm at a loss--I don't understand how this at all accomplishes what random forest is supposed to accomplish, seeing as there is no ""training, validation, and testing""--the algorithm simply uses mapreduce to compare observation attributes against the feature mean.    His decision tree example seems to be ridden with manual coder-specified decisions as well, such as a mapper with comments like   ""#split needed on left side""    (code)    ""#split not needed on the right side""    (code)      Shouldn't these algorithms be doing that work for me?

Once again, sorry for my ineptitude, I am not a machine learning programmer, though I *would* like to learn how these approaches work, instead of scratching my head at how a couple of manual comparisons qualify as ML.

talesfromtechsupport;3pqtln;1445498005.0;/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3pqtln/the_creeper/;The Creeper;"When I moved on from the computer store, it was straight into the world of desktop support. The operating system: Windows NT 4.0. At the time I was studying to get my MCSE and was working on the Workstation certification, so I was chock full of knowledge of the inner workings of Windows. So that you understand my state of mind later on in this story, I include the following information: I was also in my early twenties, single, shy, and not very good with women, at least in my mind. I found out later on that I actually had plenty of women interested in me (and amazing ones at that!) I just missed all the signs.The job was at a local company, doing second tier helpdesk – if a problem cropped up that the first tier helpdesk couldn’t resolve, I’d jump in and fix it. As the company was kind of largish, there were two of us on tier two. The other guy... Well, there’s a stereotype we're all familiar with of the unwashed pimply-faced nerd with no social skills and bad halitosis, and he was the epitome. He’d been with the company for some time before I was brought in, as the sole T2 tech support person. I didn’t immediately dislike him, but I didn’t feel an exact inclination to befriend him either. I’ll call him the PFY for now.I was sitting at my desk one day when the PFY got a phone call. It’s our boss, asking him to come take a look at something. Almost immediately after he left, a new ticket gets assigned to T2, showing probable user profile corruption. We used roaming profiles, and profile corruption happened occasionally, generally when somebody’s profile grew too big for the local computer hard drive to hold it. This happened, and more than you’d think – the hard drives we had were pretty dinky, and there were some big data files in use at the company. Also, with multiple users logging to a single system in you could run out of disk space pretty quickly. The location is customer service, and so I head on down there.Customer service was actual physical customer service at the time. People would come in, pay a bill, ask questions, do research, the kind of thing that we all do on the phone now. It was staffed almost exclusively by very attractive young ladies, the kind that turned my blood into this effervescent fizzy water and made English into my second language. I found the desk, and looked into her eyes.""Her"", in this case, was an absolutely stunning slender (but not too slender – I’m not Sir Mixalot, but I don’t like famine victims either) natural redhead with green eyes that tended to show up at work about the same time I did. Long curls of orange fire tumbled down her back, sometimes loose, sometimes braided, always gorgeous. She dressed conservatively, flats, a slightly below the knee skirt, and a cute blouse every day I saw her. She always turned left when I turned right once we got inside the building, and I had yet to work up the gumption to say anything to her. Had events gone differently, I probably wouldn’t have ever gotten around to saying anything ever anyways. I’d be lying if I claimed I’d never had any indecent thoughts, but I had it drilled into me from a young age: You don’t crap where you eat, and you don’t date where you work.I swallowed my fear (it’s a lot easier when you have an excuse to talk to someone – in this case, a trouble ticket) and jumped in valiantly. ""Hello, I hear you’re having a profile issue. Do you have a few minutes to fix it?"" She smiled, and as my breakfast leapt into my throat, said ""Yeah, that would be great! Are you new here? I haven’t seen you before."" I sat down at the keyboard and started to fix the profile issue I let her know I’d just started about a month prior and was enjoying the work.As I started the cleanup, I noticed something weird - The usual signs of profile corruption (a full C: drive) were not present. In addition, she was the only person who logged into that computer, and her profile was actually pretty small. I said, ""Huh, that’s strange"" not out of any particular reason, but because I tend to talk to myself when I’m working on computers. She volunteered that the issue actually happened to her all the time, and seemed to happen in her department three to four times a week.Something didn’t smell right to me. I’d never gotten a ticket from the service pool in the month I’d been there. I’m not sure what twigged me, but something made me scratch my head and say ""hmm."" I repaired her profile, then on a hunch enabled file level logging of her profile directory. I told her I’d fixed the issue and I’d taken a further step to see if I could figure out what was causing the issue. If she experienced it again, she could go ahead and submit a ticket, but also to email me and let me know that it had happened, and I’d take a look at the logs to see what had popped up.About two weeks later right after I arrived at work an email from her popped up in my inbox. About the same time, PFY left the room for parts unknown. I went ahead and did a remote view of her event log. There was a lot of garbage (enable file level logging on a person’s user profile sometime, it’s horrible) but I did find one gem in there:\\computer\c$\Documents and Settings\gingerhottie\ntuser.dat deleted by PFY at 6:33AMDid anybody NOT see that coming? (After all, I did title the story ""The Creeper"") For the less technically inclined, the PFY had been going into her computer via the network and deleting a key file from her profile, causing it to barf all over the place and require reconfiguration. He’d grab the tickets when she logged them and then go down and ""fix"" the issue he’d created in the first place. I suspected he’d been doing it to all the women down there.Sure enough, I found a bunch of tickets under his name that were about the same ""profile corruption"" issue. I brought it to the attention of my boss, things got rolling, and that was the PFY’s last day. I never even saw him again – he got paged away from the customer service desk, and was escorted out of the building. I was told to go down to her desk and fix the issue in a polite and professional manner, which I did. I was also told in no uncertain terms that I wasn’t allowed to breathe a word about this to anybody, which I haven't outside of close friends, until now.That should have been the end of it, but it wasn’t.";"> That should have been the end of it, but it wasn’t.Argh, ZE SUSPENSE!

I was sitting at a table with some friends, and I saw this drop dead gorgeous girl. She must have seen me notice her, because next thing I knew she sat down next to me and said ""Hi!"". My response? To say hi. That's it. After sitting there for 30 seconds or so she said ""Ok then"" and got up and left. It never even crossed my mind that someone that looked like that could be interested in me.#I still want to know what happened to the damn keyboards :/#> Are you me?

I personally think that these are interesting different viewpoints and characteristics, which are great for the diversity of ideas in a team. In practice, what are the advice for working in team with mixture of these folks? For example:- What are the collaboration barriers between these two types of people and how to overcome them? What are the things one shouldn't do to avoid conflicts with people with different background?- What kind of role in the team that will support each person to shine in his/her own way given his/her background? For example, expecting designers to code like engineers is probably not the right expectation.#[deleted]#Can ""data visualization"" be an umbrella term that contains from visual statistics to data art, and in that sense, having different goals along the spectrum? Can we say that, in some areas, the primary goal of data vis is not necessarily to inform, as long as this is clear for the audience?#Love your podcast! A couple of random questions.1. What advice would you give to 'intermediates' in data visualization? A lot of information is available to beginners, but there is not as much direction for people who are past their 'beginning' steps.2. What kind of workflow do you use? I know that the tools are only as good as how you use them. What OS do you use, what do you use to clean, etc. Or is it to dependent on the data at hand?3. Speaking of set ups, Moritz. Is this you? [i3 config youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx0eNaGzAZU) I swore it was, what does your set up look like? I just got into i3 myself#Testing the quality of a visualization is still a difficult task, specially when you try to test things other than traditional usability and eficiency metrics (insights or aesthetics for instance). How do you think we should deal with this problem? And what are the most common failures you encounter in visualization evaluation?#What's the best way to start freelancing?#Ok, let's start with this hard one first. I think data visualization should indeed strive to inform effectively, as much as possible. The best data visualizations are those in which beauty and effectiveness are in the right balance (Moritz is great at doing that!). Stephen, however is, in my opinion, using some really bad tones and targeting one single person for all the bad stuff that is out there. In the end this is counterproductive and it puts a lot of people off. Also David is great at choosing the right data and stories, this needs to be recognized.#I think SF is making a category mistake  he seems to criticize David McCandless' works not from a pop culture perspective, but his BI view. To me this seems like complaining that the crime novel does not read enough like a police report. They work in different spheres and genres  if you respect that, one can learn a lot from each other.#Interesting! First, one could think that immersion (i.e. shut off your analytical brain, and just sensually experience the moment) and analytical thinking (which requires more of a third person perspective?) maybe don't go that well together. .On the other hand, it could be great to build some really complex landscapes of data to explore, if people spend enough time and maybe it's annotated / narrated well, it could be a whole new level of experience.I find e.g. the prospect of 360 degree video super promising for documentaries.#Visualization researchers have a somewhat negative stance towards anything 3D and any kind of ""anthropomorphic design"" solution for data that has no inherent 3D physical structure. 3D seems to have quite a lot of problems in terms of occlusion, distortion and such. Yet, I'd be curious to see what a person may be able to learn and discover spending a lot of time in a virtual data environment. I think we just don't know enough about it. The benefits for 3D structures is clear, especially if you can introduce sounds and haptic feedback. For more abstract data I think one needs to find some good justifications for why and when a virtual environment is needed.#Thanks, great question! No, in fact I think there is some massive group think effect in a sense that both the design as well the science side as well as the side business of datavis often seem quite uniform (inside each group) in terms of what they like or how they work.I'd love to see more non-standard approaches! Will think more about good examples for diametral approaches. Any suggestions from the community?#Absolutely! There field has tons of diversity and this is what makes it so interesting! And by the way this one of the reasons we find our show so interesting. You can totally hear people adopt completely different viewpoints. Ok, we did not interview Stephen and David yet, but hopefully this is going to come sometime soon  )#Ha, nice one! Bonus points for the cuisine analogy!No direct analogy, but I once wrote on the role of [""bacon""](http://well-formed-data.net/archives/669/on-the-role-of-bacon-in-visualization) in data visualization — in short, using cheap tricks like faux 3D and fully saturated colors to make something look flashy, but ultimately not really a healthy information diet :)3D is really a thing people love to apply to make things look cool, but often dominates the experience and hides half of the data (think globe vs map…) so — use it only when super appropriate.The other thing I am pretty tired of is ""pointless circlification"" — bar charts don't get more exciting just because you wrap them around a circle. It's a cheap trick to draw attention (our eyes are magically drawn to anything bursty or eye-like) but not really helpful or particularly interesting…#Yes, absolutely! In the [Data Cuisine](http://data-cuisine.net) project, we often create dishes representing only a couple of numbers  very small data, but when they express important data and you meditate on them while preparing and consuming the dishes, this can be a very satisfying and informative exercise. In a way, they more you know about a dataset (and the stronger your personal position is towards it) the more you can boil it down to a manageable size.But, all good data visualization is **generous** in a sense that it should always offer a little bit more than what you asked for. The Google/Siri way to answer your question for the unemployment rate is a single number  the datavis way is to show you the number, but also reference points and context (how has it developed, how are other countries doing, how does it compare to the GDP, …) #I'd say most visualizations out there are visualizations of small data sets, I don't see many with millions. Do you have any examples?#In short, I have huge concerns about the digital consolidation into only a few big players, and the resulting concentration of data (=power) in the hands of very few, private/commercial actors. Data privacy and ""informational self-determination"" will be huge issues in the years moving forward. I don't know if you watch [Black Mirror](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/) — in the last few months I was often reminded how close we actually are to the dystopian ""science fiction"" scenarios painted there.#Choosing the ""right"" visualization for the data at hand is a very complex problem. Typically, what you need to learn is more what is the process to get to the right representation than the visualization technique itself. You need to experiment a lot and develop an attitude in which you are always striving for improvements. That said, having a good picture of the design space is a necessary prerequisite. You need to have a lot of examples in mind so that you can test and compare many of them. [Tamara Munzner's book] (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/) is in my opinion the best resources to build such systematic knowledge of the design space.#Typography is a huge part. Work through [http://practicaltypography.com](http://practicaltypography.com). Think about what people should see first, and what is peripheral ""lookup on demand"" information. Keep it simple and clean. Observe and apply. #There is a nice little book called [Designing Visual Interfaces] (http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Visual-Interfaces-Communication-Techniques/dp/0133033899). Anything from Tufte is also a very good guide for principles that lead to good aesthetics. Also, my golden rule of aesthetic for non-designers (like me) is that less is always better than more. I stick with whites and grays, use well-established conventions, avoid fancy stuff. I also copy a lot! Don't be afraid to copy. It's a good way to learn.#When I heard that 89% of statistics are made up, that sort of made me think.#I don't have one off the top of my head. This would come as a surprise but rarely I find statistics very convincing as an argument. Most of the time I can see how limited they are. There are always some other statistics that are not shown and would be needed to have a much better picture of a given problem.#Aaaaaaaaaaah!!! LOL, LOL, LOL, ...#Tough one! Do I go for looks or brains… let me think about this a bit!#Robert (much better accent)#Always assume the data is biased, incorrect, lacking, lying in some form… Look for what's missing!Create as many views as possible, with simple tools. Look for the recurring patterns. Get in a dialogue with the data. Don't narrow down too early. Go broad, with cheap means early on  narrow, with expensive means later on…#I think both me and Moritz like Tableau as a first entry point to a new data set. It's really good for what I call ""data familiarization"", that is, to just start looking into the data set and get a better sense of what is there.#I like to use Tableau for quick data analysis, especially tables, plots and maps. For network data, it's Gephi. I am also quick enough in python and d3 to quickly code something up. Other people use R or Excel for these early explorations. The most important thing is really to find an environment that allows to quickly produce a lot of different views on the data. If it's cumbersome, you will settle down too early and miss out on a better solution or more interesting story.#First, I think you shouldn't show ""vast amounts of data"" directly, but find good ways to structure, prioritize, juxtapose, sequence, nest, … interesting information. You can show rich visuals but they need visual hierarchy, and structure. For non-experts, be careful with language (too technical language easily scares people off), Look into narrative techniques such as stepwise reveal, overview.and-detail, and annotations… Generally, people can digest quite complex things in my experience if it's presented right.#I am of course biased here but I think Moritz's work is the one that best achieves the right balance between beauty and effectiveness. The [Better Life Index] (http://truth-and-beauty.net/projects/oecd-better-life-index) is a really good example of this balance.#My all time favorite are pretty much **everything** from Wattenberg/Viegas, Ben Fry, Jonathan Harris. #I think D3 is the best bang for the buck as it gives a lot of freedom and it can easily be published on the web.#Good question. Usually clients approach me with a challenge. Often, they have some other project of mine they really liked and want to have something ""along these lines"" which can be a bad start. I prefer of they just outline the problem and give the good access to data and have good ideas on the strategy side of things, and leave tactics/design to me. I also tried to approach clients with concrete ideas, but actually, this rarely worked out! I also sometimes do self-initiated/self-commissioned works but then they usually end up as art/own projects, rarely turn into client work directly. In the end, the mix is important!#I depends what you mean by telling a story with data. My sense is that a person giving a talk with a slide deck is actually telling a (business) story, right?#I don't have a favorite guest but I noticed that I tend to like a lot guests whose work I did not know well before having them on the show. One recent example is [the one with Domestic Data Streamers] (http://datastori.es/data-stories-58-domestic-data-streamers/). They create some amazing data installations and I was totally blown away by their work.#I am always much more for depth than breadth. Mastering one single tool makes you much more powerful than having a shallow knowledge of lots of stuff. As for which one to pick, I think it's a very personal decision. If you know R already, choosing ggplot2 is probably a good idea. But if you want interaction you need d3. One important parameter for me is how easy it is to show your work to others. What I like of d3 is that you can just send a link to a collaborator and your visualization is available in an instant.#We do have [one with Gregor Aisch from NYT] (http://datastori.es/data-stories-tv-00-the-nyt-3d-yeld-curve-chart-w-gregor-aisch/)! But once we tried we decided video is not the right medium for us. It takes much more work and it's much harder for people to use. Also, it gets boring pretty quickly.#I am not sure I am the right person to answer this because I am mostly surrounded by computer scientists in my team. That said, for what I see happening in great places like NYT and Bloomberg, that have some really good teams, there seems to be no strong distinctions between figures. I don't think the right model is to have designers who design and engineers who develop. They all need to be in the same team with more emphasis on one or the other aspect but all in the same team.#In academia you can explore pretty much whatever comes into your mind. On the other hand it's easy to get lost in ideas that may not have a real impact in the world.#Sure, why not? Journalism encompasses all kinds of activities, and outputs, from click bait to think pieces, opinion. Film making ranges from documentary to fiction with all its sub genres. I think data visualization has lots of genres, too! And it can only advance the field to learn about these, and learn when to apply which method, or narrative stance… (see also [Wattenberg and Viegas on data vis genres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRgJnX1lr04))#Yes, I think so. I am still somewhat uneasy with the idea of data visualization without information transfer but some data art is simply super beautiful and I love staring at it. As long as the intent is clear I have no problem with data art. I actually love it. The best for me, however, is always the right kind of mix of beauty and information (possibly somewhat surprising information).#Hi!1. Yes, agreed. Connect with peers on the same level, practice, learn from other communities…2. For me, it's usually Tableau, Gephi, Python, d3 in the early stages, custom code in coffeescript / ES2015 + all the rest of the web things or processing for the end product. Sublime Text. 3. Haha, no!! No idea who that guy is, but NOT ME :D#I think the biggest failure is not making the goal explicit. If you don't know what the goal of your vis is there is not way you can test it. I think there is a lot of confusion in this sense. A visualization can be tested and, hopefully, measured according to so many possible parameters! Visualization seems to be used a lot for visual communication these days but I have not seen many testing it for comprehension. Being able to read the visualization in the first place, even before looking at the content, is crucial in my opinion. In turn, this is also related to visual literacy, which is a very important topic.#Do a few projects that show what you can, and most importantly, what you **want** to do. Be part of communities / meetups / … Share and help! Understand that 30%-50% of your time will not be billable — calculate accordingly. Learn to manage your time, and communicate effectively. Be good at emails and calendars. Make sure to keep the boundaries between work and free time intact. That's all I can think of right now — I have been doing it for 10+ years and am still figuring it out :D#One more thought - don't look for the perfect project, but, at all times have a combination of projects that **together** work well for you (e.g. one might be good for the wallet, another one good for the soul…) - don't chase unicorns! #Thanks to you both for great answers. #OK, some more thoughts:Should you know the basics of the craft, and try to communicate the data clear and effectively? Absolutely. (Even if you do light-hearted ""pop vis""). Has DMC made mistakes in that area, in the past? Absolutely. Does this warrant to make him a ""persona non grata"" who should not be invited to universities, and does it invalidate all of his achievements? You got to be kidding me. #360 degrees documentaries as Chris Milk did looked absolutely stunning. I'm wondering if with all the unstructured data we are recieveing if it's possible to create some sort of unstructured, virtual reality world with it. How you're going to use controllers inside of it to get some actual work done I have no idea, but I like the thought of actually walking within my data.

The best in terms of emotional impact. Absolutely love his work.#I agree - in many cases the person giving a talk with a slide deck is telling a story. However, leveraging tools like Tableau's story points or presenting using interactive visualizations (at least in my experience) rarely happens, even when the story might be more persuasive and effective in that form. What are your thoughts on why that is?#Wow, that's great! It's particuarly interesting to me because I've been experimenting with representing polydimensional data in 3d, and I really liked the NYT curve. It was great to see the design process behind it-- the video really helped.#... I also think it is very hard for a designer to be successful without coding and for an engineering without having design skills. You really need both IMO.#Talking about visualization literacy, what is the state of it nowadays? Do you believe that the fact that visualization got more popular improved visualization literacy? Or do you think that the majority of the people just see pretty graphics and does not understand them and can't get insights from them?#But I have to admit, I did not read the whole discussion. I have kids at home, so I have my fair dose of me-me-me and sand throwing already…#I'd love to make it more controversial but this is exactly my opinion also. And, with all due respect, I am not sure it makes sense to spend more time talking about this issue. The best way to go is to keep doing your own good stuff, that's the only thing that matters. We don't need more internet fights.#Unfortunately, Stephen does not want to come on the show :(#Yes, I think it depends on what you mean by ""small"". If small is in the order of hundreds or thousands of data points, most visualizations are small data visualizations. If you mean in the order of tens or even fewer, yes absolutely! Even with very few data points you can enhance communication through graphical representation. Did you even see Santiago Ortiz's [45 ways to communicate two quantities] (http://blog.visual.ly/45-ways-to-communicate-two-quantities/)?#Ah, interesting. Yes, in principle people tend to book you when the cannot handle the data themselves, so you might not get engaged for anything that works fine in Excel, straight-away. But, in many of my assignments I actually work on smallish datasets, i.e. in the 1'000s or 10'000s of items.#Has anyone ever seen Andy and Robert in the same room, at the same time? #justsayin#I think that the means used to tell a good story does not matter much. It doe snot matter if you use story points, paper handouts or a plain powerpoint presentation, what matters are your skills in giving a good presentation. We need to train for skills, not tools. That said, tools like story points have been around for such a limited amount of time, whereas power point has been around forever. Technological adoption is a big thing: people don't want to change their habits and they resist changing them unless there is a very very good reason for doing it. I guess that's the main effect here.#Ah... my meaning was that these skills are not boolean. People should have both coding and design, but not everybody excels at both (there are some who does, but harder to find). It's more common to see people with both skills, but much stronger in just one direction. e.g., designer these days can also code, but perhaps not as expertly as folks who are trained a lot about programming in CS. I am just curious to see how they will work together."
DebateAChristian;3qblsg;1445888996.0;/r/DebateAChristian/comments/3qblsg/do_you_think_its_ethical_to_recruitevangelize/;Do you think it's ethical to recruit/evangelize children so young and so hard? Thoughts on the 4-to-14 window and faith like a child.;"**Debate Topic Overview:** ***4/14 Window, Should we be evangelizing youth, and Faith Like a Child***Overwhelmingly, if you look at evangelism/conversion numbers for Christianity, you will see that [the vast majority come from people ages 4-14](https://home.snu.edu/~hculbert/ages.gif). Christian studies have shown that this 4 to 14 time window is the time that 83-85% (depending on the study) of Christians converted during their lifetime. Further, children ages 5-13 were shown to have a 32% chance at converting, whereas youths 14-18 only have a 4% probability of doing so.[This website](https://home.snu.edu/~hculbert/ages.htm) details the Nazarene survey results to that effect (of which a similar survey conducted by the International Bible Society showed almost idential results), this website is literally [www.4to14window.com](http://4to14window.com/), and [the Barna Group did similar research back in 2004](https://www.barna.org/barna-update/5-barna-update/196-evangelism-is-most-effective-among-kids#.Vi58RX6rRhE). It's no secret that the church makes a massive effort to have children and the youth involved, and that they usually have their own special classes, camps, focuses, events and trips. I saw many friends convert to Christianity in this golden 4-14 window, but it didn't seem coercive or sinister for churches to hit those age groups hard until I found a pile of research on the topic years after college. Further, all research I've done on the topic online seems to focus on this research meaning we should evangelize people from 4-14 *harder* and use it as the window of opportunity it's shown to be. That doesn't seem to jive with me, organized religion using big data to be opportunistic in preying on children (that they hope to be future members).**So, all that said, my main debate point or question is:**   **1)**  Is it ethical to proselytize children, KNOWING that they're highly susceptible to influence during their developmental age window?  **2)** If Christianity really is the pure, saving grace that claims it's based in reality, critical thought, and exegesis, whyis it still pushed so hard on the youth, and not presented when they are older? At that point, they will have more developed critical thinking skills and can make their own binding and legal decisions. **Opening Thoughts:**It seems like if Christianity is the unassailable salvation that it's touted as, that it should be something that's able to be presented logically and convincingly to adults, to great effect. Targeting children and using data points to isolate exactly when they're most vulnerable to become a member of your religious group is something that would be hailed as despicable by Christians if they saw another religion do it, yet it is a beyond common and widespread occurrence for churches to do. When I questioned several church officials along this line in the past, they cite that the adults do not have ""faith like children"", as was so often quoted to me when I had doubts about a very doubtable religion. Children do have amazing faith which can be admired, but it's also a very vulnerable faith which is why they are also convinced to believe in Santa, the Tooth Fairy, and any number of things. Hearing that the same type of faith needed for believing in Santa is the type of faith that adult Christians should have is very, very offputting.";"You have to realize that Christians believe what they're teaching their children is true. If you assume that this is their motivation then I see no problem with this. You (and I) only have a problem with it because we disagree with Christians. I personally would rather people teach religion once they hit the age of reason but that's a personal preference - parents will always teach their culture to their children.#I have a real hard time with this question. It appeals to a myth of neutrality in education and child rearing that just isn't possible to achieve. All of our individual perspectives of the world contain *tons* of axiomatic belief structures that we can't help but pass along with our children.  This is especially true when you consider the blindly obvious fact (if you have kids anyway) that our children learn far more the example of our lives than the words we say.  Our family is Christian. It's in the air we breath, its who we are, its the very center of our home - and I couldn't keep from ""evangelizing"" them if i wanted to.  Consider such a scenario: I get a call that one of my parents have died. Heartbroken, I now have to tell my 4 kids that their grandparent has died. Of course, they are devastated and have questions. Should my response be to tell them what I believe about a future hope of resurrection, and to take them in my arms and pray with them and for our family? Or, should my response be to say ""kids... I'm sorry but none of you are old enough to be evangelized, please leave the room so your mother and I can pray as consenting adults.""?  So sorry to disappoint, but that is not the approach I'll be taking. I tell my kids all the time, ""you are Christian because you're ours, plain and simple. But there will come a day when you will have to decide for yourself what is true...you don't get to ride mommy and daddy's faith forever, at some point you're going to have to accept it as your own or reject it."" I make it clear to them that I will love them whatever they choose to believe, and we're very honest about discussing the reasons a lot of people don't believe and how those people are pretty much just like us, trying to make the best sense of the world as they can.  But at the same time, I don't lay it out like one worldview doesn't make better sense than another, because I obviously *do* believe one perspective of the world is better than the other, and *I can't help but* lead them and teach them accordingly. #By ""should we,"" do you mean to ask a question on ethics?We need to frame this up a bit and understand what moral duties, responsibilities, and rights parents have in regards to their own offspring.  Do parents have the right to teach their children as fact things that they sincerely believe are true or do parents have some grander epistemic sort of obligations to only teach these things once they have fulfilled some reasonable epistemic duty?#I don't think so. that's just my personal opinion but if you're a christian, you should be given that right to raise your child that way. I mean, we have some great muslims, christians. Its not entirely immoral unless you are teaching them to hate everyone else.#I think u/SsurebreC summed up my own opinion fairly well. There is one thing I'd like to point out about the studies you cited. The reason so many Christians ""Convert"" between 4-14 is because they were raised in the church and within a Christian nuclear family. These people have less hard and fast moments of conversion. People older than 14 who are exposed to Christianity for the first time are most likely people raised outside of the church in non-christian families. They thus have a much lower rate of conversion. #Is it ok to teach children history, math or the scientific method?#Where in all of your research does the fact fit that the vast majority of Christianity -- Catholicism, Orthodoxy and mainline Protestantism -- doesn't have conversionism as a main theme, as Evangelical Christianity does?#Parents are de facto verbally and non-verbally teaching and training their child from day 1.  Even if you made every reasonable effort to avoid ""recruiting"" your child to Christianity, the *influence* of the parent's Christian faith on their character and decisions that they make would still be highly influential on the child.  It is a farce to think the child could be somehow shielded from it.#Ideally, you would focus on teaching a child critical thinking skills and give them the tools to discover the truth, but to some extent, when kids are too young for that message, we have to teach them some things without them figuring it out themselves.I have no intention of teaching my sons about religions until they are older and have a more functioning bullshit detector.  But on he other hand, I'm already teaching my oldest cool stuff about animals, the moon, rainbows etc.  I hope he'll get older and care about the how we know things, and that I can instill a how do we know that attitude.  I don't think religious people are indoctrinating their children out of a bad place.  They (at least most) aren't purposefully teaching their kids about their religions because they know it's garbage and their kids won't buy it if they wait too long.  But I do think that if something is really true, then give your kid the tools to think critically and your beliefs are true, they should stand the scrutiny.#The question you're asking is it okay to teach your child. For every parent that'd be different. An atheist would most likely produce an atheist child, and a Christian would most likely produce a Christian child. This goes for everything (political leanings, etc.)#> 1) Is it ethical to proselytize children, KNOWING that they're highly susceptible to influence during their developmental age window?Is it ethical to teach children what you think is right and wrong?> If Christianity really is the pure, saving grace that claims it's based in reality, critical thought, and exegesis, why is it still pushed so hard on the youth, and not presented when they are older? At that point, they will have more developed critical thinking skills and can make their own binding and legal decisions.What binding and legal decisions do you think we're tricking children into making?#>1) Is it ethical to proselytize children, KNOWING that they're highly susceptible to influence during their developmental age window?If I believe that what I'm teaching them is right, wouldn't it be actually morally wrong to withhold the truth from them? If I think that them learning about Christianity is as important for their well-being as learning how to behave in society, as learning that eating food and drinking water is important for their body - am I not actually *obliged* to teach them about Christianity?>2) If Christianity really is the pure, saving grace that claims it's based in reality, critical thought, and exegesis, why is it still pushed so hard on the youth, and not presented when they are older? At that point, they will have more developed critical thinking skills and can make their own binding and legal decisions.What if I believe that if they'll die without believing in Christianity, they'll go to hell? Am I not, again, *obliged* to tell them about it? Generally - what's the point in waiting when it comes to delivering an important message? If I think that stealing or hurting others being wrong is self-evident, based in reality etc - why shouldn't I wait with teaching children about this until they've developed critical thinking skills either?#The way I see it, parents have a moral duty to provide the best education for their children. That means that if the parent thinks that teaching them Christianity is the best thing, that's what they should teach them. I have a further objection to your argument. Let's suppose that the parent decides to wait and see what their child chooses. This doesn't solve the problem. Remember your premise, young children are essentially sponges, they will absorb whatever they come into contact with. If the parents don't teach their kids Christianity, they'll pick up whatever they come into contact with. Leaving the development of your child to chance seems even worse in my opinion. #This is a great post, as it gets at something usually washed over because it's still socially normative in most societies, but for outsiders, shows some of the immense power and privilege religion as an idea has over other ideologies.I would think any person convinced of a religion through its evidence and reasoning would be appalled by the fact that childhood indoctrination is how the vast majority of members come to their faith.Also not brought up but equally important, the social pressure and benefits of remaining a believer once you enter adulthood.If someone truly believes their belief system is superior, it should make them think twice that most people are indoctrinated into it, and we don't see wild swings in changes in belief as would be expected among a population of these questions were considered on they merit except in those places where childhood indoctrination into religion is fading.#>  Christians believe what they're teaching their children is true.And looking at it from this perspective, the question is like asking a parent if it's ethical to teach children history.#I would say if a parent truly believes it would be unethical for them *not* to teach their children. I have no problem with the teaching, other than the fact that I believe they are wrong.#That raises the question, how many parents believe their religion is true?  From studies I've seen, not many.  Not many even understand their own stated religion's belief system.  And, as you imply, it's more about culture than belief.  Still, I believe the only reason this is seen as normal is because of its prevalence.  And there is some real inconsistencies.  Quite a few people would think it immoral to teach a child that hell is real for example, even as they identify with a religion that claims hell is real.I guess you can try and show at least some sympathy to indoctrinating children in this manner, but what of Nazi parents indoctrinating their children who believe Nazism is true?  All I keep seeing (I've brought this up before in other threads) is replies that if the parents really believe it's true, then it's somehow moral.  But people can believe incredibly terrible and false things are true for bad reasons, and I think the reasoning has to be part of the equation.  Plenty of non-believers to this day are scarred by upbringings that caused them to fear eternal torment, so it's hard not to see the real psychological trauma indoctrinating children can have.#[deleted]#Great point. In my family growing up, church was central to our daily lives. We'd all go 2-3 times a week. it was central to our social life: the vast majority of my parents -- and my --friends were church friends. My parents were highly involved and in leadership, so those conversations would bleed into our everyday life. My dad got his job from a close friend at the church. Whenever we went through hardships, we'd get support and encouragement, even tangibles like food and clothes, from folks at the church. My mom's currently employed by the church. I can't see how rending the church from my family for 1-2 decades would be anything other than a complete social, economic and emotional upheaval of our lives. #Of course you could raise your children without presenting opinions as fact, and from the way you describe it, you try to to some degree.  It's just that it's tough for parents to do.  Doesn't mean it can't be done or shouldn't be strived for.I don't really understand telling your children that they're Christian because they're your children.  That does seem heavy handed IMHO, and I'm not sure at the logic behind it.  It does come across as ""if you were ever to leave Christianity, you would no longer be ours"", even though you've said that you'll always love them, that is putting huge pressure on children to conform to your belief system to stay closer to the family.  They may believe you'll love them, but would be disappointed, or worried they will go to hell, etc., so they'll not be as honest with you.  I've seen that many, many a time.I think the issue is that for a belief system like Christianity, childhood indoctrination seems obligatory because of the nature of the beliefs, so it's hard to reconcile the belief system with the ethical question if childhood indoctrination for believers, from what I've seen.You could replace ""Christian"" with ""Nazi"" and incorporate racist ideology instead of Christian theology into your above paragraph and it would be just as justified as ethical, which is to say it doesn't really seem to address what is wrong with indoctrinating children and why we shouldn't do it.  It seems more to be saying that it's hard not to as a Christian because of the nature of the belief system, but that doesn't address the crux of the question.#I suppose in my question the onus wasn't necessarily placed on somebody (such as the parents or church) and further, didn't outline an ideal conclusion if it was found to be morally wrong. The parents generally aren't the ones looking through top-level data and attending regional conferences to find the best times and methods to convert the children, or knowing how astonishingly high conversion rates are at certain ages, so I'd put the onus on the church. It's just a little baffling to me that if you were to talk to anybody in general about large scale converting children to ideologies from ages 4-14 that people will be super against this (child soldiers, Scientology, extreme religious sects or cults). However, sending kids to Sunday school en masse around these ages will result in mass ideology imprinting that (in my humble opinion) is an incredibly similar affair that most children are not equipped to handle at those ages. They will not be able to take in enough information by that point to make a well-informed decision on the matter, and often no counterpoints or alternate material is presented. Is that really the way that you (or whomever) think that people should come to religion? At an age where half of the demographic still believes in Santa because they trust their authority figures implicitly no matter how ridiculous? That is one of my main points, that if Christianity holds up then it shouldn't matter if you present Christianity to adults. Yet, when adults and children are provided with the same conversion efforts, adults have a full 78-80% lower conversion rate than children 4-14. That is where ethics come into play in my mind, when the same person could (and statistically does) have different reactions to the same materials at different times, but we present this information to them only at a super-trusting childhood time in order to deeply ingrain it. #Exactly. If you raise your child in a christian household, or even a different theistic household, teach them to not be religiously intolerant. I think that is where most of the world's problems stem from.#If children were not ""raised in"" the church but instead taught to critically think and taught about what many religions believe, would the conversion rates change?  The problem is that ""raising in"" a church often involves socially acceptable indoctrination.  The question is whether such indoctrination should continue being socially acceptable.#> Is it ok to teach children history, math or the scientific method?Yes. Are you equating personal religious beliefs (or religion on the whole) with those topics though? You'd have to elaborate if so, as history and math are pretty globally agreed upon (and testable, provable) subjects and the scientific method is almost the opposite of personal religious beliefs.#Those things involve demonstrable facts. #> Where in all of your research does the fact fit that the vast majority of Christianity -- Catholicism, Orthodoxy and mainline Protestantism -- doesn't have conversionism as a main theme, as Evangelical Christianity does?Source? Seems like an odd claim to throw out, especially since I'm betting that Catholics, Orthodox members and Protestants (of which I used to be one) still pass on their religion to their kids. Not to mention that Catholicism is known for it's numerous schools for children, and that Christianity on the whole is evangelical despite what each denomination might be ""known for"". I don't see how you'd think otherwise, as the only way for these denominations to continue are recruiting children created by members (aka internally), adults from other denominations or unchurched adults (externally).Also, for the record, I have no issue with conversionism or adults talking to other adults on these topics. My issue I raise with this post is that there are so many children that get caught up in the tide of adults involved in their religion, and that they're not developed or informed enough yet to cry foul or dissent in any way. If they *do* dissent, they're often told they're wrong (which further exacerbates the problem). #Well I don't think it's OK to teach your child to hold your political leanings either.#> The question you're asking is it okay to teach your child.On one level, yes. On a much higher level (perhaps national, governmental or globally) I'm asking if it's responsible to pump children full of suppositions during their most developmentally critical time. Instead of respecting that developmental time, I've seen countless examples from my time in the church and conferences of churches wanting to *exploit* that developmental (4 to 14) window and hit it harder rather than back off. I worked at a church camp for 4 years for 4th-12th graders where youth pastors would put up looping videos of 'The Passion' in every major building all day, and then hammer the kids at night, making them believe that they were responsible for what they saw happen to Jesus today. That particular youth pastor and church was *all* about getting kids into the water, and weren't above exploiting their youth, naïveté, or the fact that they were away from their parents for the week in order to do so.You don't get these questions about school systems or political leanings because the children are not indoctrinated on myths/suppositions, but instead are taught objectively agreed upon content that betters them. I know that makes it sound all cold-hard logic and no room for feelings or perhaps things like political leanings, but as I said in another post in this thread:> Sure there are feelings-based things you would teach your child (Ex: Love, Courting, Sportsmanship, Politics as in your example) as the world is absolutely not all cold logic and numbers, but those feelings-based things also aren't telling them they'll burn for eternity if they don't believe you. Susie may turn out to be a Republican, and you may be a Democrat, but the difference is that Susie wasn't enrolled in Democrat school as soon as she could be to hear stories of how great Democrats were while praying to past Democrats and teaching as doctrine that you go to hell unless you're a Democrat.There are reasons that the religious conversion rate is so high around the 4-14 age bracket, and perhaps if that age bracket wasn't hammered so hard and given eternal life-and-death ultimatums, then religious zealotry and resentment would be replaced by a genuine coming to religion at a later age. Droves of people are leaving the church, and from speaking to my friends at least anecdotally I have a lot of examples that left because of how forced it was on them as a child. If looking at things from the aforementioned higher level, do you want your religion to be seen as one that wins hearts and minds of adults? Or would you rather it be seen as having 85% of it's members convert as children, where they often have little to no say in the matter (be that literally, or due to intense familial/social pressure) and are accepting everything told to them as proven truth.#Does it matter whether what you think is true actually is true?  Just because a parent teaches their child their understanding or right and wrong or facts about the universe because they believe it to be true doesn't make it ethical.#> If I believe that what I'm teaching them is right, wouldn't it be actually morally wrong to withhold the truth from them?  If you tell them that you believe it, that's one thing. If you tell them that you *know* it, you are withholding the truth.#>Is it ethical to teach children what you think is right and wrong?I think it would be wrong in certain cases.  Like if your beliefs are wrong, you would unknowingly be doing them harm by convincing them that your false beliefs are true.  Or if your beliefs are not proven or reasonably demonstrated to be likely true, but you convince your children that they are known to be true and they can be confident that they are true, you are harming your children.#It's the binding biochemical and social decisions that are being thrust upon them.#> What binding and legal decisions do you think we're tricking children into making?Christianity? Nothing legal necessarily, or at least nothing in the major sects. That wording mainly exists as a catch-all for if other religions went after children as well. There are well-documented occurrences of children in Scientology signing billion year contracts, for instance. However, while Christianity's version isn't legally binding, for all intents and purposes the motive is the same in converting the child to the religion (via baptism, contract, or other means).#In response to 1:  It depends.  You're indoctrinating your child into what you think is right, but if you think you could be wrong, then it is dishonest to present your opinion as fact.  And if you think you can't be wrong, not only are you being dishonest with yourself and your child, but let's hope you believe nice things, because down that way some truly horrible beliefs could lie.  2.  If you believe your children will suffer for eternity for not worshipping your God, then you might want to wonder why you worship such a god, or if you have good reason to believe what you do, because it is a burden you are putting on your child to inform them they could be tortuted for eternity for not behaving a certain way, so it's something that you don't want to take lightly.  From what I've seen, people put that burden on their children without even knowing or understanding their own thoughts on the subject very well, the vast majority of the time.#> And looking at it from this perspective, the question is like asking a parent if it's ethical to teach children history.On one small parents-only level, yes. On a much higher level (perhaps national, governmental or globally) I'm asking if it's responsible to pump children full of suppositions during their most developmentally critical time.There are reasons that the religious conversion rate is so high around the 4-14 age bracket, and perhaps if that age bracket wasn't hammered so hard and given eternal life-and-death ultimatums, then religious zealotry and resentment would be replaced by a genuine coming to religion at a later age.

Or would you rather it be seen as having 85% of it's members convert as children, where they often have little to no say in the matter (be that literally, or due to intense familial/social pressure) and are accepting everything told to them as proven truth?Also, from a much more simplistic level, equating teaching your children religion with teaching them history is asinine. At no point in history class are you asked to sing to, pray to, or profess your love for any past history member or invisible superbeing. Nor are you told that the superbeing loves you and that you should love him, regardless what ""the world"" says. I can't count the number of times I was told as a kid or youth group member not to be part of ""the world"", when parents and churches *should* be raising kids to be responsible members of the world and not to fear it because it may undermine their lies.^(Copied from a recent reply to someone who brought up the same point, or framing of the issue)#What a great summary, thanks!#> how many parents believe their religion is trueI'd say vast majority of them believe that their own beliefs and whatever they teach their children are true. Why wouldn't they? Would you teach your children something that is both important and not true? I wouldn't.> Not many even understand their own stated religion's belief system. This is why I feel those types of parents ""outsource"" those types of teachings to their local church and they simply tell their children that those religious figures have the same authority as teachers as far as to ""listen to them"".> it's more about culture than beliefIt's both and I made a general comment. After all, atheists do this too - teach their local culture to their children. If the local culture believes in celebrating Christmas, I doubt atheist parents teach their children that Jesus is fiction, Christmas is a lie, and Santa doesn't exist. >  what of Nazi parents indoctrinating their children who believe Nazism is trueSame thing as American parents indoctrinating their children to believe in American superiority and other jingoistic nonsense. Soviet parents taught their children that capitalism is evil since that was the local culture, the state provided incentives, and this was taught in school. Source: I was raised in Soviet Russia.> if the parents really believe it's true, then it's somehow moralTo them, yes. This means that sometimes it includes teaching that anyone else is immoral. It's sad but it is what it is - some people say people of a different race are immoral. It happens.> people can believe incredibly terrible and false things are true for bad reasons, and I think the reasoning has to be part of the equationHere's the thing: you can reason anything. It depends on whether others accept it. If they're children and they're not very good at reasoning, they will accept the very lame reasoning of their parents without question. This happens on a larger level, look at the acceptance of faulty reasoning by tens if not hundreds of millions of people across the world about, say, invasion of Iraq.> Plenty of non-believers to this day are scarred by upbringings that caused them to fear eternal tormentIt depends - other Christians don't believe in eternal torment.> it's hard not to see the real psychological trauma indoctrinating children can have.I wasn't raised in a religious family and I was also told not to touch the stove or it'll hurt. There were plenty of threats - real and imagined - and they were for my own good. This is because my parents knew better than me and they were trying to protect me the best way they know how.#Your reply reminded me of this small essay by Chesterton which you might enjoy :-)http://www.athenaeum.edu/pdf/TheTruthaboutEducation.pdf#That is very close to a description of my upbringing as well. When, ultimately, my conclusions led me to reject those beliefs, it was not easy. But I do not blame my parents for raising me in what they thought was the truth. It's inconceivable to think that they wouldn't.#>  It does come across as ""if you were ever to leave Christianity, you would no longer be oursI didn't say they were ours because they are Christian, I said they are Christian because they our ours. You've swapped the order of contingency there. If they reject Christianity they would still very much be ours.>They may believe you'll love them, but would be disappointed, or worried they will go to hell, etc., so they'll not be as honest with you. I've seen that many, many a time.I guess I appreciate your concern and all but I feel confident they would be honest with me, we talk about these kinds of issues quite openly- they would have nothing to fear. Another question. (Putting aside the fact that what I teach my kids about hell is likely wildly different than what you're imagining) Why would they be afraid they were going to go to hell if they had already left Christianity anyway?I suppose they might be concerned that I would be disappointed, but heck, disappointing your parents when you mature into ideology that differs from theirs is just, frankly, part of life.Do you have kids?  Would your kids not be afraid of disappointing you if one of their principle ideologies shifted from what you had taught them?  Or do you not teach them anything about what ideas they should hold?  Do you raise them in a completely neutral environment where you don't live out your axioms, beliefs, and perspective of the world in front of them? With them?  What does it mean to you to be a ""family""? Do you actually think that it is possible to hide from your children the beliefs that are absolutely most fundamental and central to you? I don't, *at all,* think it is. What would a completely neutral environment even look like? I can't even imagine it. I would argue that you can't do it and neither can I. And that's probably a good thing because it sounds like a terribly shallow way to raise a child imvho.#>Of course you could raise your children without presenting opinions as factI present to my children the Truth as I see it and arm them with the education and critical thinking to judge for themselves what they believe. >You could replace ""Christian"" with ""Nazi"" Zero to Godwin in a single comment.#I would say a few things. First of all, I think a strong and healthy barrier between your kids and my kids is key to our society functioning. Societies that breach this barrier are rarely societies anyone wants to live in for long. Second, I fail to see the difference between ""indoctrination"" and simple acculturation. Do your kids speak chinese? Think of all the languages kids are cut off from because of mono-linguistic parents. Are your kids taught to share equally, or does the eldest one get preferential treatment? I'm guessing you believe in equal sharing, but this *belief* (and it *is* a belief) in equal sharing between people has nothing to do with science and everything to do with your culture. If little jimmy decides that as the eldest male he gets all the toys I'm guessing you're going to correct that behavior and I'm also guessing that little Jimmy is going to be made to ""critically think"" until he arrives at the conclusion *you* want. Third, ""indoctrination"" usually involves nothing more nefarious than a parent volunteer and felt-board-Jesus. I find it very silly that Atheists object to this as child abuse, but seem to have no problem with the families plopping their children down in front of a violent video game (which much more closely resembles what we would call brain-washing). Fourth, ""raising in church"" means that someone was raised in a Christian home within a wider Christian culture centered around a church. People raised in cultures tend to stick to them. There is also no such thing as a neutral culture and it would be impossible to raise a religiously neutral child. #> history and math are pretty globally agreed uponReally? Especially history?#So does Christianity.#History isn't just facts about things that happened in the past. It necessitates selecting and emphasizing certain facts over others, a narrative structure, etc. -- all of which are subjective. Have you ever seen a middle school history textbook in the US, with the Liberty Bell and flags and eagles plastered all over it. It tells a story of American exceptionalism, defeating British tyranny, beating the odds and realizing manifest destiny, defeating slavery then racism, then winning WWII and the Cold War... History's inherently ideological. #Oh yeah?  Demonstrate some history for us.#I mean, look at the responses [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/3npkc7/how_come_christians_always_seem_to_have_a/). It's just common knowledge to me that ""born again"" soteriology is different than those of other Christian traditions. Of course there's Christian pedagogy, infant baptism and catechism, etc., but the meaning and purpose of these aren't conversion, per se. I'm just thinking you may want to treat your analysis of these different phenomena differently. #The thing is, kids are going to be ""indoctrinated"" no matter what. Whether it be them seeing MSNBC over Fox News in a waiting room, or seeing sensationalized news articles on the internet. #> Like if your beliefs are wrong, you would unknowingly be doing them harm by convincing them that your false beliefs are true.Like, for instance, if ""it doesn't matter what you believe"" is false?> Or if your beliefs are not proven or reasonably demonstrated to be likely true, but you convince your children that they are known to be true and they can be confident that they are true, you are harming your children.Proven or reasonably demonstrated according to what standard?#You ignored my first question.  Is it ethical to teach your children what is right and wrong?You mention the idea of 'converting the child to the religion.'  Does this apply to other, non-religious beliefs as well?  Should I not teach them my ideas about government until they're old enough to vote?  Is a completely uninformed 18-year-old somehow more ethically raised than one whose parents let them discuss political ideas, being honest about their own political leanings?#Alright, so I have two options, I'm either being dishonest or I'm being dishonest?>You're indoctrinating your child into what you think is right, but if you think you could be wrong, then it is dishonest to present your opinion as fact.Is it dishonest of me to teach my child what I believe to be a fact? For example, I believe that evolution happened. However, I could be wrong. Is it dishonest to tell my child that evolution happened? I believe that drinking drain cleaner will damage my child's body. Is it dishonest to tell my child that drinking drain cleaner will is harmful to them?I believe that stealing is wrong. Is it dishonest to tell my child that stealing is wrong?>And if you think you can't be wrong, not only are you being dishonest with yourself and your child, So, in other words, I can't believe that I'm right, because it would be dishonest? >let's hope you believe nice things, because down that way some truly horrible beliefs could lie.Ah, so it would be better if I believed that drinking drain cleaner would actually not hurt my child? Because it's always better to believe what's nice instead of what's right?>If you believe your children will suffer for eternity for not worshipping your God, then you might want to wonder why you worship such a godWell, if you put it that way, the reason should be really clear, right? I mean, as you say, if I believe that my children would go to hell for not worshipping my God, I obviously would worship such God so I don't go to hell either. >or if you have good reason to believe what you doNon sequitur, just because what I believe doesn't sound nice doesn't mean that what I believe isn't true. >because it is a burden you are putting on your child to inform them they could be tortuted for eternity for not behaving a certain wayIs it a burden to inform my child that they could be injured or killed if they do certain things (drinking drain cleaner etc)?See, the problem with your comment is that you're ignoring the believer's perspective - you're simply assuming that religion is all false anyway, so making a child worry about something that doesn't exist is bad. What you're ignoring is that to a believer, someone going to hell if they behave in a bad way is as true as someone being harmed by drinking drain cleaner, so it would be deeply immoral to not warn them about danger. Is a child more worried if they know that they can't simply put anything they see into their mouth without checking it first, since it might kill them? Certainly! But them being worried sure is better than them being killed, isn't it?#>  I'm asking if it's responsible to pump children full of suppositions during their most developmentally critical time.This is the same thing as teaching kids outright lies like how everyone except Columbus thought the Earth was flat. And I personally don't like it, but if the parents really do think that Columbus was a genius who figured out that the world was round, then that's gonna be what they want their kids taught. > There are reasons that the religious conversion rate is so high around the 4-14 age bracketThere are also reasons that math, science, and other fully legit school subjects are taught around that time. Remember, if the parents really believe that it's true, then they're going to regard religion the same way as they regard school classes. That also makes itself apparent when people try to force religion into schools.> If looking at things from the aforementioned higher level, as a parent do you want your religion to be seen as one that wins hearts and minds of adults? Or would you rather it be seen as having 85% of it's members convert as children, where they often have little to no say in the matter (be that literally, or due to intense familial/social pressure) and are accepting everything told to them as proven truth?Do you want *math* to be seen as a subject that wins the minds of adults? Or would you rather 85% of people learn math as children?With math, at least, I would rather it be taught to children, because it's facts. These parents regard religion to be just as factual as math. So they're going to say, teach it to children.> **Also, from a much more simplistic level, equating teaching your children religion with teaching them history is asinine.**The real point. They're definitely two very different things. You and I see religion as this weird thing where people fanatically worship some ""invisible superbeing"" (and we're probably right) but not many cult members would ever say they're in a cult, and these parents are the same way- they regard praying to God as a perfectly normal thing.#Why wouldn't they?  Because a lot of people don't really care whether the details of their religion are true or not, they don't even care to know what the details are.  They outsource it, as you say.Culture isn't a belief system.  You can't ""indoctrinate"" into a culture.  The point with Nazi parents doing it, or nationalist Americans, or Soviets, is that most people recognize it is wrong to indoctrinate children in those instances because they personally think the beliefs are reprehensible.  But if all it takes for indoctrinating children to be moral is the sincerity of the parents, then nobody has any business saying indoctrinating your child to be a KKK member is wrong as long as you sincerely believe.#I was saying they wouldn't tell you if they left Christianity if you feared them going to hell. Not their own fear.  I remember after my grandmother died my mom would worry if she was in hell since my grandma wasn't a believer.  I found the belief system that would entertain such a thought to be pretty repugnant, and childhood indoctrination of such harmful beliefs doubly so, if you don't have that belief, good on you, I think modern Christianity is getting away from the idea of hell because of how tough it is to stomach for a lot of Christians.I don't have kids, but I would try to be clear in what ideologies I held to and why, and not present them as fact, and try to make sure they knew of opposing viewpoints and felt open to challenging me etc.  It sounds like you largely try and do the same thing.  I think there is a temptation for many parents to just present their opinions as facts to their kids because it's easier.I don't think a completely neutral environment is possible, I just think parents shouldn't take advantage of their kids gullibility and vulnerability to impose a worldview on them.#The idea that no matter what a parent teaches their child, it's not immoral as long as the parent sincerely believes is one that's more easily highlighted with extreme comparisons as to what the implications are.#1.  Sure, and when it comes to what parents choose to teach their children, it wouldn't be practical or preferable for a government to intervene anyways (though in extreme cases they do), but the question isn't whether society should force parents not to indoctrinate their children, but whether it should be socially acceptable.  I don't think so.  Just like a parent telling a child their opinion as fact on political questions is often seen as tasteless, so should religious indoctrination IMHO.2.  Critical thinking used in the way you described is a form of indoctrination (one which many churches use quite well, from what I've seen), and assuming I would use it to further my own views among my children is pretty irrelevant to the question at hand.  The language analogy doesn't seem to be relevant either, language isn't a belief system.  The easy way of putting it is that teaching opinions as facts to kids should be seen asa wrong because it's a form of manipulation to get what a person wants by exploiting the weakness of ba other (convincing children of your worldview by using their gullibility as children)  That doesn't mean you can't tell them your opinions and try to convince them of your opinions, the tasteless aspect is using a child's naivety and ignorance as a tool in convincing them to adopt your opinions and preferences.  3.  If a parent volunteer tells a child the Bible says if he doesn't believe he could go to hell, that's not all that innocuous and its some pretty heavy stuff to be putting on a child, for example.  And keeping it to simple ""Jesus loves you, you'll get to see mommy and daddy in heaven"" also inserts some very serious ideas with deep implications into a child and is not in any way benign IMHO.  For churches that represent their beliefs as just their beliefs and not fact, they're doing it better.  For those that encourage questioning, even better.  But that's not the natural role of religion or churches.4.  But Christianity is a belief system, and while a whole culture surrounds it, a belief system is very different from a culture, and indoctrinating someone to believe in said belief system has very different ethical implications than teaching a person about their culture.#More facts agreed and proven globally than events in the Bible, yes. As /u/themsc190 pointed out below, history is absolutely flexible when it comes to narrative, victors writing the history at times and nationalism (depending the history source text). However, for the vast majority of events that were notable (especially notable for more than one country/region) yes, pretty much globally agreed upon. You're welcome to provide examples to prove otherwise if they exist, but also that would be rather off-topic at this point considering you never actually said anything about the 4-14 window or topic and just threw out other things children are taught.#See, now that's a lie.#If it were demonstrable facts then this subreddit, along with all the other religions in the world, wouldn't exist.#As long as you tell your kids that religious myths are just as false as those claims then there isn't any problem.#[History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU83R7rpXQY)#> The thing is, kids are going to be ""indoctrinated"" no matter what. Whether it be them seeing MSNBC over Fox News in a waiting room, or seeing sensationalized news articles on the internet.Right, but you're moving the goalposts here. Do those children have to go to MSNBC Class on Sundays and then pray and sing to MSNBC in between seeing it on the television sometimes? There's casual, longform indoctrination that may happen over time if the parents leave one biased political networks on, but that's not quite comparable to purposeful, knowing indoctrination of naive trusting children into ideas that aren't proven or corroborated elsewhere. The latter is much worse, and is the point in question here.#> Like, for instance, if ""it doesn't matter what you believe"" is false?Yes, that would be a bad thing to teach a child, because it is known to be false, and it is in anyone's best interest to hold true beliefs and as few false beliefs as possible.>Proven or reasonably demonstrated according to what standard?According to any objective and demonstrable standard.  I think if you cannot demonstrate that something is likely true, it would be unethical to try to convince a child that it is known to be true.  #It's one thing to tell them what your opinions are. The problem comes with making *factual* assertions that you can't back up with evidence (or worse, assertions that are demonstrably factually false) and then telling your kids they'll go to Hell if they are unable to buy into it.#I ignored your first question because it's blindingly obvious and leading. Yes, it's ethical to teach your children what is right and wrong. Do I get to ask you questions now?* Is it ethical to teach your children that if you believe hard enough that you can survive lions den and being in furnaces?* Is it ethical to teach your children that if somebody makes fun of your appearance that you use your faith to have bears maul them en masse?* Is it ethical to teach your children that it's super cool that God led the Israelites on a path of war and genocide, because they're ""His"" people?* Is it ethical to cram your child full of one religion from an extremely young age and further say that all other religions are wrong?  * Bonus question: Would you have the same answer if you were over in Europe/Asia and teaching your child Hindu or Islam?> You mention the idea of 'converting the child to the religion.' Does this apply to other, non-religious beliefs as well? Should I not teach them my ideas about government until they're old enough to vote? Is a completely uninformed 18-year-old somehow more ethically raised than one whose parents let them discuss political ideas, being honest about their own political leanings?I think something strongly missing when comparing how religion is taught to kids versus how other things are taught to kids are objectivity, alternate information sources provided and the ability for children to ask meaningful questions. When I or my peers asked harder questions in church or Christian schools, we were mostly met with platitudes or diversions, never thoughtful discussion or anything straying from the Christian script. Before you jump down my throat for saying objectivity also, consider that religion is often incredibly emotion-based as opposed to other learning opportunities provided. Children are not taught based on what they see, hear or can touch. Instead they are taken into dim rooms with haunting singing, passionate closed-eye monologues to ""God"" and then told to go with what they feel.So, when teaching your child about voting, taxes, the various political parties and machinations, hygiene, math and science, do you go through those same motions? Do you sing worship to the Tax-Lord and pray to TaxGod before teaching a lesson about taxes to your child and then having him opine his feelings on a certain part of the tax code? No, because that's not how we teach children things, or at least not things we know to be true that don't need to be cloaked behind fanfare and formality. I realize you're being hyperbolic in trying to equate Christianity (or religion in general) with every other bit of knowledge you would teach a child, but it's disingenuous and diversionary to try and actually equate those things. Sure there are feelings-based things you would teach your child (Ex: Love, Courting, Sportsmanship, Politics as in your example) as the world is absolutely not all cold logic and numbers, but those feelings-based things also aren't telling them they'll burn for eternity if they don't believe you. Susie may turn out to be a Republican, and you may be a Democrat, but the difference is that Susie wasn't enrolled in Democrat school as soon as she could be to hear stories of how great Democrats were while praying to past Democrats and teaching *as doctrine* that you go to hell unless you're a Democrat.#It's not dishonest to teach what you believe to be fact, as long as you present it as a belief of yours.  So for evolution, you can say evolution is overwhelmingly accepted in the field of science and you think it happened, and here is all the evidence for it.  Nothing dishonest there, and you're not just saying ""evolution is true"" with nothing further.  For drain cleaner, the same.  You can tell them that not only do you think it is dangerous, but so too does the company that makes it, hence the warning label, and the government, and that people who have drank it have died, etc.  For stealing, you can say why you think stealing is wrong, and why most of society does as well, and why we have instituted laws against stealing, and how context can change when taking something from another is stealing etc.You can believe you're right, as soon as you present your belief as immutable fact, you're being dishonest.It's always better to believe correct things, but for some questions, there is no clear ""right"" and ""wrong"", just a spectrum of preferences, but if you believe you're always right, or your preferences are always truth, there is no limit on what you'll teach your children.  Do you think a parent that honestly believes the white race is about to be extinguished and teaches their children to not associate with black people as a result is acting in a reprehensible manner?  Why?  Because you disagree with their views, because they're imposing those views on their children, or both?  If you really are thinking of imposing the view on your child of hell and God, then it's not quite the same as imposing the view that the Cubs are the best baseball team.  It will have deeper implications for your child to have such a belief.  A lot of parents don't know or care about the deeper implications, so they don't examine their own beliefs very well on such weighty subjects before subjecting their children to them as fact.  That's the point I was getting at.I'm not assuming anything, I'm stating my opinion that indoctrinating a child is always wrong, period, no matter how sincerely a belief a parent holds.  I'm stating that the sincerity of the belief they're indoctrinating their child into doesn't change the immoral aspect of indoctrination.  It would seem you would hold any parent blameless for indoctrinating their children into whatever terrible ideology as long as the parent sincerely believed. #> Because a lot of people don't really care whether the details of their religion are true or not, they don't even care to know what the details are.I'd say they care about as much as a typical atheist parent is interested in truly proving evolution or the Big Bang theory. I.e. they have some background but not the details and certainly not the credentials.> You can't ""indoctrinate"" into a culture. Really? Clothes, style of speech, musical interests, language, sports team preference, etc?> is that most people recognize it is wrong to indoctrinate children in those instances because they personally think the beliefs are reprehensibleSo indoctrination is OK, just the particular views are bad (Nazi's, religion, Soviet, etc). How do you feel about parents indoctrinating children about not talking to strangers?A quick Google definition:> Indoctrination is the process of inculcating ideas, attitudes, cognitive strategies or a professional methodology (see doctrine). Indoctrination is a critical component in the transfer of cultures, customs, and traditions from one generation to the next.Again, the real difference is that you (and me) frown on theists indoctrinating children about theistic concepts. However, the theists disagree that they're doing anything wrong so unless you're going to forcibly remove children from their parents, I don't see how you can stop parents from teaching their own children the culture of the parents.#>but whether it should be socially acceptable. I don't think so.I would argue that behavior of this kind is unavoidable for every parent, whether they are secular or religious.>and assuming I would use it to further my own views among my children is pretty irrelevant to the question at handI wasn't trying to accuse you of anything. I was illustrating how it's impossible to actually comply with what you're asking. The idea that ""critical thinking"" is some teachable antidote to beliefs passed on within cultures is one that I think is very false. It's not Christians who aren't letting 4 year olds critically think. Nobody in any culture is letting 4 year olds critically think. Little Jimmy doesn't get to reason for himself and decide what to eat, where to go, when to sleep, who to visit, what to read/watch, and on and on and on. If you're going to pick on Sunday school it seems silly to ignore these things. The decision to teach little Jimmy that despite his age, strengh and gender he isn't allowed to take his sister's toys is a culturally based belief that is indoctrinated into him.>The language analogy doesn't seem to be relevant either, language isn't a belief system.Language is the most important part of a culture. By *not* learning chinese I was cut off from a huge set of beliefs, ideas, values, traditions, entire schools of thought, and knowledge of all kinds. My monolinguistic family thus made permanent life altering decisions for me. I'm guessing the proportion of people who learn Chinese after the age of 6 is pretty low. >And keeping it to simple ""Jesus loves you, you'll get to see mommy and daddy in heaven"" also inserts some very serious ideas with deep implications into a child and is not in any way benign IMHO. I don't think *any* beliefs about death are teachable without being serious and laden with deep implications. That does not mean that it isn't worth talking to kids about in an age appropriate way. >indoctrinating someone to believe in said belief system has very different ethical implications than teaching a person about their culture.My point is that without even thinking about every parent is actively teaching their children a complicated set of beliefs. ""Culture"" isn't just Christmas vs. Hanukkah. Culture is a massive set of beliefs and practices that touches on everything. As I said in my earlier example, very very few people in the west think the eldest child should be treated better than the younger kids. The decision to treat children equally and to define fairness that way is a cultural belief parents indoctrinate their kids with. This and countless other things make it impossible to not indoctrinate children. #OP said ""involve"" demonstrable facts. Christianity also involves demonstrable facts.#Just because disagreement exists doesn't mean that the disagreement is justified.Or would you say that people disagreeing that the moon landing ever happened means that it's not a fact that the moon landing happened?#My point is that education untainted by ideology is impossible. Giving students critical reasoning and other tools to evaluate competing ideologies is necessary, of course. #No. Quit trolling.#That's actually evidence, not history. The history is that we accept it is a video of JFK being shot. But there are other, less plausible explanations. That's why you're wrong about history being subject to the scientific method, and that's why your verificationism (now increasingly rejected even by atheist philosophers) is false.#> The problem comes with making factual assertions that you can't back up with evidenceJust on this note, many parents teach their kids that gravity exist without knowing the physics behind it. Or teach kids about the planets and stars without having a clue about astrophysics or where to even find the evidence.#Evolution and the Big Bang theory aren't ideologies about how to live life.  They aren't belief systems involving values.  I don't really like the Wikipedia definiton, as it is so broad and far away from the original definition, which is much more about ideas:http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/indoctrinationPart of it is the wrangling over the definition of indoctrination, as religions realize more and more of society sees it as distasteful.  If you can redefine the word to mean something benign, then all the better.  Or if you can make the word practically meaningless.Regardless of what definition you want to go by, it's really about the position that using a child's naivity against them to easily impose a worldview is wrong.I hear two arguments so far that really seem more like excuses: that it's impossible not to and that everyone does it.  Neither addresses whether indoctrination of children is ethical and why.  I've also heard that if the parent sincerely believes then it's ethical, but I'm not sure why that is?It's about avoiding the temptation to manipulate a vulnerable person that a parent has a lot of control over.  I think it's worthy to not do so.I do believe given many of the implications of Christian belief, it does seem very hard to do so, as the threat of hell for some may make the ethical wrongness of childhood indoctrination pale in comparison to eternal torture.But what sort of being would put that choice to parents?  Either indoctrinate your children lest they risk eternal tortute or risk your children being less likely to believe.  The belief system hamstrings parents on this choice I think.  I think the way to stop parents from indoctrinating their children I religion is to make it socially distasteful, and it slowly is becoming so in the US from what I've seen.  Less people are raising their kids in the church, and less kids are believers in the same religion of their parents as a result.#I suppose if you think it's impossible not to indoctrinate children, then ethical implications don't enter, but I think it is possible to not indoctrinate children.  Sure, you can't help but influence them because they'll be primarily exposed to a parents view, but it doesn't have to be presented as a fact of life as much as the parent's own view.#[deleted]#Comparing the conspiracy theorists claiming the moon landing was fake to the majority of the world not being Christian is a false equivalence. #>My point is that education untainted by ideology is impossible.I don't agree with this but it's off point anyway because religious indoctrination is not education. No facts are being taught at all. It's all just unsupported assertion. Sometimes it even involves provably false assertions (i.e. denial of evolution).#>That's actually evidence, not history. It's both. >The history is that we accept it is a video of JFK being shot. But there are other, less plausible explanations. No there aren't.>That's why you're wrong about history being subject to the scientific methodIf you've been taught this, then you've been misinformed. #True, but most still know it is demonstrable in some manner of they were to look.#Nevertheless, the evidence exists and the kids can seek it out. #> They aren't belief systems involving values.To be honest, you're sort of right, but you CAN make the case that you can have a system of values based on evolution simply because it proves that all life is connected. You can do something with that.Thanks for your definition but the core concept is still intact.> it's really about the position that using a child's naivity against them to easily impose a worldview is wrongTwo things here:* teaching a child a worldview is right, depending on the worldview. You don't disagree that teaching them not to harm strangers is a good thing and there's a myriad of other lessons that are taught to children that's good. You're not reading what I wrote - you have no problems with teaching children anything. You really define ""indoctrination"" as ""religious teachings I don't agree with"" rather than any actual indoctrination which includes teaching children anything.* seems like you believe in objective moral values. This is interesting to me as an atheist since I don't believe they exist and it's been my experience that typically theists believe this.> Neither addresses whether indoctrination of children is ethical and why.Indoctrinating children ensures survival of the child. If parents don't tell their children not to go with strangers, to always come home, to stay safe, to not touch the stove or play with the knife, more children would die. Animals indoctrinate their children, ffs, it's called teaching your child lessons to ensure survival. In case of theists, this includes deity appeasement. You and I don't agree with it but it's part of indoctrinating. It's the difference between:* don't bite strangers, vs.* don't bite strangers because Jesus wouldn't like itIt's not a question of ethics, it's simply reality. A crappy parent will indoctrinate their children to torture animals. This is wrong based on judgment of society. Society currently believes **religious indoctrination** - your ACTUAL complaint - is still positive and we're in the minority so far.> It's about avoiding the temptation to manipulate a vulnerable person that a parent has a lot of control over. I think it's worthy to not do so.Only because you don't buy the theists argument. If you did, you'd agree with them. Your idea of teaching your child to watch both ways before crossing a street is equivalent to theists when they tell their children to pray before bed.> I think the way to stop parents from indoctrinating their children I religion is to make it socially distasteful, and it slowly is becoming so in the US from what I've seen.That'll take a very long time. What's happening more is that the fundamentalists are losing influence in your everyday households.#Jews and Christians rely on demonstrable facts, such as the history of ancient Israel (definitely existed, many kings and cities confirmed by archaeology).Islam relies on the life and teachings of Muhammed. Same with Joseph Smith and Mormonism.#Why? I hope you're not trying to appeal to popularity.Your comment above implied that simply because disagreement exists, the disagreement must be justified. The point of my comment was that disagreement isn't necessarily justified. #It was an analogy, not an equivalence. And the analogy is valid.#That doing history as I argued above is inherently subjective is widely unquestioned in the academy. I don't see how you can disagree. #>mostThat's the point. Even those who don't know jack about astrophysics beyond pop culture will still teach their kids about the planets and the stars without being able to back it up.Not being able to supply peer reviewed evidence for the things you teach your kids is fine. That is why school is there. #I doubt 7 year olds will comprehend the evidence about astrophysics should they even find it.#Teaching a child a worldview isn't the same as imposing a worldview.  Each child will have to develop their worldview from what they're taught regardless, it's just a matter of whether a person wants to manipulate that development in a way that conforms with what the parent wants.For example, if a person tells a child that evolution is wrong and the Earh is 6000 years old, as is still very commonplace to do, they are placing a burden on that child and knowingly manipulating that child to their belief.  It doesn't matter how sincere the parent is, the parent understands by telling their position as fact and not exposing the child to contradictory facts or opinions they are shaping the child's worldview. Objective moral values are a bit of an aside, but from what I've seen, most atheist philosophers believe in them I think?  Not sure I do, I'm saying they are wrong according to my preferences and to many other people's preferences as well, it's just that religion gets a pass I believe due to its power in society.Teaching children survival is education, not indoctrination, and again, I suppose we can go round and round with definitions, but teaching a child facts isn't the same as telling a child your opinion is fact.  Telling a child to watch both ways is advice/education on surviving, I really fail to see how it's the same as telling a child your opinion on the nature of reality is fact.  We know cars are real things that move and kill people.  We don't know that prayer does anything, and studies have shown no difference so far.#The history of Israel is irrelevant to Christianity being true or not, though. It is not central to the religion.#No, I'm not appealing to popularity. I was merely saying your equivalence was laughable. We have verifiable, observable and testable proof the moon landing occurred. We do not have such proof God exists or that Jesus was ever resurrected. #No, it wasn't and no, it isn't.#Because that's a complete distortion. History does give us facts to work with even if there can be disagreement over exactly what they tell us about the past. Ideology plays no role in competent historical method. Imposition of ideology sabotages the method. I see no analogy to religion here anyway. Religion is not an interpretation of hard data. There is no data and no method. It's all just gross assertion.#Who is teaching astrophysics to 7 year olds?#Are you serious?#> We have verifiable, observable and testable proof the moon landing occurred.And a Christian would say that they have proof that God exists or that Jesus was resurrected. >We do not have such proof God exists or that Jesus was ever resurrected.Some people would say that there's no such proof that the moon landing occured.You obviously don't think that the people doubting that the moon landing happened are correct. However, they clearly disagree that it happened. And [according to your earlier comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/3qblsg/do_you_think_its_ethical_to_recruitevangelize/cwdt86e) their disagreement indicates that the moon landing isn't a demonstrable fact. After all, if it were a demonstrable fact, people disagreeing that it ever happened wouldn't exist, right?#""We have verifiable, observable and testable proof the moon landing occurred""You're confusing historical inquiry with the scientific method. It's the same mistake AJ Ayer made in inventing Verificationism. History is empirical, but it is not chemistry.#Sorry, I don't mean ideology in the pejorative, biased lens sense -- but as the range of unconscious ideas, the necessary imaginary that connects the real conditions of existence. This is why I say that history isn't simply disconnected facts about the past.And I see an analogy between subjectively linking these facts about the past and subjectively linking facts about one's own social, political and economic existence in religion.#>Religion is not an interpretation of hard data. There is no data and no method. It's all just gross assertion.Mere ignorance can't possibly account for a falsity of this magnitude.  No data you accept is not an absence of data. No method you've bothered to understand is not an absence of method. The only 'gross assertion' here is your own. #Teaching them the bare bones basics about the planets and junk is still astrophysics where neither parent or child might be able to comprehend the evidence.#Yes. Central to Christianity being true or not is the Resurrection of Christ and his status as divine. Israel's history is irrelevant next to this.#>And a Christian would say that they have proof that God exists or that Jesus was resurrected. Verifiable, observable and testable proof?#> Some people would say that there's no such proof that the moon landing occured.Get a real strong telescope#Except no. You can actually verify and test whether we landed on the moon. They left stuff behind that we can observe. They put reflectors down in precise cooridinates so that if you want test and verify whether they were, you yourself can do it.#You cannot present any shed of evidence or data, or show a legitimate method to justify any supernatural assertions. None exists.#What's to comprehend? They're big rocks spinning around in space. That doesn't take any special knowledge. It's also supported by evidence which religion is not. That's the essential difference. Religion is not backed up by anything. The parent is teaching stuff as fact that is not demonstrable as fact, and in some cases is demonstrably false.#>Verifiable, observable and testable proof?Ah, now that's a different discussion - here you're asking whether the quality of the proof justifies disagreement or not. However, your initial point was a different one, namely that the mere existence of disagreement indicates that the quality of the proof isn't sufficient. I'd prefer it if you didn't move goalposts. #I agree, you can view evidence that the moon landing happened. But it is not reproducible in the way that vinegar + baking soda = reaction. Empiricism and the presence of evidence =/= reproducibility.That's why we use ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" in criminal trials.#This is a baseless assertion you arrive at solely by declaring the evidence and methods non-existent.#I'm not arguing the latter part of your comment. I'm merely saying that, other than religion, there will always be things that parents teach their children that they cannot verify with demonstrable facts. As long as this is not done in malice, then this is not ethically or morally wrong. #No, I did not have an initial point. What I did have was a facetious comment that you are fixated on. **The** initial point however was whether there were demonstrable facts that Christianity is based on. I'd prefer it if you did not obscure the discussion by fixating on irrelevant details.#> But it is not reproducible in the way that vinegar + baking soda = reaction. Yes, it is. All you need is money and you can **test** the hypothesis that we landed on the moon. There are even several ways of testing it. #That's not a declaration, it's an objective observation.#>there will always be things that parents teach their children that they cannot verify with demonstrable facts. This is not true. I don't teach my kids anything that isn't demonstrable fact. #I can't help you any further. If you would like to be better informed, google ""reproduction and scientific method"" ""empiricism"" and ""evidence.""#There's nothing objective about it.  It's your subjective assertion that objectivity is required.  There's no epistemological reason why truth must be demonstrable or quantifiable.  To say that Christians do not have evidence for what they believe -- and do not have scrupulous methods for arriving at and understanding those beliefs -- is patently ignorant.  You are effectively declaring every Christian who has ever lived to be mentally ill -- which, even if you were qualified to make such a determination, would still be unethical and procedurally suspect, since you've not clinically evaluated every Christian who has ever lived.""That's not a declaration, it's an objective observation.""#Well good for you, sunshine. Just because you do it doesn't mean everyone else is unethical or immoral if they don't.#>to be better informedYou mean better than the PhD I'm currently doing in medical research? Or do you just want to keep being condescending because you can't accept that there is verifiable, testable and reproducible evidence for the moon landing but there is none for Christianity? #It is a fact, not an opinion, that there is no evidence to support Christian claims and that sometimes there is evidence directly against them. Your own personal indignation at having that pointed out to you is not evidence.>You are effectively declaring every Christian who has ever lived to be mentally ill I never suggested any such thing. Do you you think that all Muslims are mentally ill?#If they tell their children they know things that they do not know, that's unethical, especially when combined with threats of eternal torture if they don't believe it.#Absence of evidence you deign to accept is not absence of evidence, though you muster all the powers of Almighty Smug to make it so. #But if they *do* believe that they know?#There is no evidence to either accept or reject. Nothing has ever been offered that meets any scientific definition of evidence. #They know they don't have evidence.#Again -- and I'm happy to restate this truth as often as you like -- any absence of evidence is due solely to your rejection of all that is offered. #To them, evidence may not be as important as faith and belief.#What has ever been offered?#That's the problem. That's why people fly planes into buildings.#Wow what a generalisation. How many religious people have there been in the world and how many of these have flown into buildings?#I didn't say that *everybody* who is religious does it, or most or even a significant number. That's a worst case scenario. That's where rejection of reality in favor of blind faith leads in its most extreme form, but faith is replete with smaller stupidities, like refusing medical care to children, or beating them to exercise demons or wider corrosions such as homophobia, science denial and subjugation of women.#Congratulations, you have shown everything possible bad about religion and excluded every possible good thing that can come from religion. What does that say about you?"

We're working hard on making these results more useful in a couple of ways: 1) releasing clinical tests that will allow you to have much more detailed, actionable information 2) improving the display and content of our citizen science results so they are more useful. Stay tuned!#Yes, there are definitely differences between labs, which is pretty normal at this stage -- remember that American Gut is an academic science project and uBiome's current results are citizen science results. Neither is to be relied upon to make medical decisions. We wrote [a blog post] (http://www.ubiomeblog.com/american-gut-and-ubiome-data/) about the possible causes of these differences at the time. #EDIT: We originally used Greengenes and Qiime, but have moved beyond it to use our own dataset as our dataset has grown. We've done a lot of manual and machine curation to improve data quality. We believe that it will and are doing a number of academic collaborations that we hope will be published.#It's a great question. It's a fairly new area of medicine -- Nature called it a ""new organ in the human body"" -- so I think the knowledge is still disseminating to the medical community. We hope to do more educational efforts as we grow.Correction: I remember seeing a headline in Science or Nature on this, but all I can find right now is an article in [J. Clin Microbiol Infect](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22647038).#This is so frustrating. I wish the medical establishment was better informed of the emerging microbiome research. When I recently asked my ob-gyn to perform a vaginal swab on my baby born by c-section, they had no idea such a thing existed, though thankfully they did allow me to try the technique, mainly out of curiosity. Typically, though, whenever I bring up the microbiome to a doctor I am politely brushed off.#I am a medical professional and it is not that we are unaware of the microbiome, it is that there is very little to no information on how to interpret or manipulate the microbiome. The best current treatment option is fecal transplant for C. difficile enteritis. There is also growing pressure to avoid antibiotics as much as possible and the growing use of probiotics. At present we have little data on what works and what doesn't and just randomly using probiotics can lead to untoward side effects. My current recommendations focus on a diet high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables and low in sugar and red meat. Hopefully databases such as ubiome will lead to a better understanding of the microbiome and how to best manipulate it.#The amount of focus on nutrition for doctors and nurses amounts to about ~1-5% of their overall training. Also, the previous absence of modern DNA analysis made characterizing gut microflora very expensive and difficult.  In other words, its an area of science (like most) being greatly enabled by fairly recent discovers in technology and scientific/medical literature.  #We have a number of new initiatives on the way. There's a lot to explore in the microbiome!#Thanks for the question! I'm very interested in the link between the microbiome and mental health. We have a couple of studies planned (launching soon) to begin learning more about how bacteria can affect our moods and mental states. With the gut producing massive amounts of neurotransmitters, there's so much to learn about how the gut-brain axis works. What mental health conditions would you be most interested in having us look into?#We should have a 2-week turnaround time at this point, so please contact support@ubiome.com if it's taking longer and we'll figure out why. I'm not aware of samples being confused or lost and would love to hear more about what happened, so feel free to write in and I'll look into it.For the different bacterial counts, see answer above and our blog post (http://www.ubiomeblog.com/american-gut-and-ubiome-data/). Remember also that citizen science data isn't to be used for medical decisions. :)Additional note: Every sample is barcoded and is scanned by an automated system and handled by robots  because of this we have minimized the number of problems with samples. The samples are unpacked and put on the robot by our staff, and in this step (in particular if a sample is packaged in a funky way) it is possible a sample can be missed.  Also, sometimes users forget one of their samples.#Eat a plant-based diet rich in green vegetables and fresh fruit.  Avoid sugar.

If it is taking longer, please write to support@ubiome.com and we'll figure out what happened in your case.#No. The 16S technology used by uBiome and others is only accurate for bacteria. Candida is a yeast, which biologically speaking is as about as different from bacteria as humans are.#In order to determine genus, family, order, class, and even phylum, first a species ""hit"" must be obtained. The entire prediction relies completely on this single species being identified through a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). Often this species is wrong, but very similar to other species in the same genus. However, if the top ""hits"" are to species belonging to different genera, then a determination must be made based on some criteria for filtering out closely matching species. I'm curious what this filtering criteria is...ie. how many of the 10's of 1000's of unique species identified at the BLAST stage make it through final QC to be included in the dashboard report?  #The way we have solved this is to provide the user with a tube with a preservation solution.  This kills and disables the bacteria immediately with little effort from the user.  We further treat the samples when they reach the lab to obtain the maximum amount of microbial DNA.#I think that citizen science (whether through crowdfunding, public participation in research, open journals, launching consumer products before clinical ones, etc.) is becoming more and more mainstream in scientific circles. When we did our crowdfunding campaign, the largest previous project was [Ethan Perlstein's $25k raise] (http://www.ethanperlstein.com/the-science-crowdfunding-landscape/). Look at that blog post for an idea of what it was like in 2013. We were #14 on Indiegogo with a $350k raise. Now, look at the top funded campaigns -- there are many science-focused ones. [AOBiome] (http://aobiome.com) is launching consumer products and looking at clinical applications after. There's a lot of activity.#This would be great.  Open source everything and you'll have better results long-term, and attract the technical talent you'll soon be starving for! #Not trying to troll, but could you expand on how this is linked to microbiome and nutrition? #We would love to do this! With 23andme and other genetics researchers as well. Come join us. :)#Our sequencer reads each DNA molecule from both ends.

I think it is now available on-demand.#[deleted]#Thanks for the link to the blog post. Very helpful. It still leaves us in an area of uncertainty if any of us wish to try to take action on the basis of reported results of microbiome testing. Should everyone be waiting until the academics and citizen scientists sort out a recognized and standard protocol?#What about companies like Genova diagnostics?#Very frustrating, indeed.  Despite having a degree in biology, I had never heard of the word ""microbiome"" until a few years ago.  Turns out that we've known about beneficial bacteria as long as we've known about bacteria in general.I suspect it has something to do with the fact that antimicrobial drugs are huge profit centers for pharmaceutical companies, while probiotics, cultured and fermented foods have long been relegated to the realm of ""quackery.""#> There is also growing pressure to avoid antibiotics as much as possible and the growing use of probiotics.This is a key trend.  Linking the microbiome to an area of familiarly to health care providers and medical professionals will be a good bridge to learning about treating various autoimmune diseases and other ailments through better nutrition. #The whole gamut!  I think more severe forms of mental illness lack study in this area and have more to gain.

Borelia is a species of bacteria, and ubiome tests for bacteria. Why not see if Dr. McDonald is correct? Ask him for some slides and sequence for Borelia DNA in the brain tissue samples. If some Alzheimer's patients are sick due to bacteria this will move the research forward significantly. There's bound to be diagnostic test in there somewhere.#I would love to join you. How do I get in touch?#We haven't made a public announcement yet, but we're working hard and will let you know as soon as we're ready to launch!#I guess there are a few kinds of ""meaningful"". In a scientific sense, ""meaningful"" often means that we know the mechanisms of the genes in the bacteria, or what it does. Until recently, it was difficult to know how many bacteria there were in the world. It is commonly thought that 99% are not culturable, but [some studies, e.g. this one] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1279316/) show that this may just apply to environmental bacteria, while oral bacteria are about 50% culturable. So there's a lot to learn from microbiome sequencing to add to scientific knowledge.In a clinical sense, ""meaningful"" means tied to specific human health outcomes. We're also learning about that, but it's a different process.#Fecal transplant seems to be the only reliable way to change the gut microbiota in a meaningful way. http://genome.cshlp.org/content/20/10/1411.long  However, Maybe I don't know enough, but I don't see an issue with firmicutes being the dominant phylum.

HDFS is the hadoop filesystem. A few things you need to know - it's a distributed filesystem over lots of linux boxes, each of which has lots of local disk. Each block of data that's written gets written three times to different hosts to provide high availability, so if one host goes down, you still have 2 other copies available to you. Hadoop and HDFS work best with relatively few really large files. Lots of small files are not great. This is, after all, big data, not lots of little data.One other thing - quotas are set on directories. So, if you say, limit the /stuff directory to 40,000 files then it won't let you write more that 40,000 files or directories under that structure.  You might, as in our case, also limit a particular subdirectory, such as /stuff/application, to 20,000 files. That way, when that application tries to write more than 20,000 files, only it is affected, not everyone who uses the /stuff directory.  I wonder why we might have had to institute that limit for that application...So we get a request in from the developers to increase the /stuff/application directory to 7,000,000 files. Yes. 7 Million. We look, and they are currently using 12 of their 20,000.So we ask why they want such a huge increase, and remind them that hadoop/hdfs doesn't do so well with lots of small files.  They say it's just the way their application is written, plus the increased volume of work, means that they need that number of files in order to do everything as parallel as possible.  They ask> Can you please explain the problem with 7,000,000 files?I explain, once again, that in hadoop, low number of large files is good, and a high number of small files is bad.I then go on:> in HDFS, our block size is 128M. That means that if a file is 1 byte, it takes up 128M of disk space. If a file is 128M plus one byte, it takes up two 128M blocks. > so, 7,000,000 files takes up 7,000,000 128M blocks. That's 854 Terabytes. Then each block is replicated 3 times. That's 2.5 Petabytes. That's the minimum, regardless of how big the actual files are.> This hadoop cluster has a total capacity of 330 Terabytes, so 7 million files simply won't fit by close to 3 orders of magnitude.> And that's before we even look at performance. We haven't heard back.;"You want to store 7 million files?Ok, we're looking at about $2 to 4 million just for the storage. Then we can start talking about the servers that will host that storage.

It is now giving me a lot of problems (shuts down frequently even when I move the laptop a little bit sometimes). From all the responses here, I'm beginning to think it was because it was built with poor cooling solutions and bad thermal paste (Running VMs heats up the laptop a lot). The main reason I'm considering this laptop is the price-specs ratio. Now I'm reconsidering my choice of HP.#I'm choosing HP mainly because I can get it serviced in many places.

Their heatsinks, especially in their gaming laptops, are not good enough to keep your laptop cool. They use shoddy thermal compound, and shoddy fan motors, as well.

HP support is terrible, they will give you the run-around on most warranty repairs. Their hinges are almost all attached to the top-case with metal, but the LCD cover with plastic, and these are very easy to break. I ran two computer repair shops for several years, and I will tell you that HP and Dell were the only reasons I was able to stay in business. I would recommend Lenovo or ASUS. Both have good support, and both generally do not sacrifice anything on build quality (Lenovo is better than ASUS on this aspect).#the brand is notorious for having poor hardware that is prone to malfunctioning and flat out dying.

I charge my acquaintances and friends about 20-30 to do this sort of work. At my shops, we charged $129.EDIT: this is for an overheating problem, which with the symptoms you describe, is my best guess on the cause.#* Yes it's IPS 1080p display * I'm no professional, so viewing angles and colors look great to me * Build quality is awesome. This laptop feels really well built. That is the main reason why I chose this over the cheaper ones.

I watched the whole video, but I am not really sure what the innovation is (due to lack of knowledge).#Well normally deploying services is hard. Mark was connected to his machines at home all of which weren't configured. He deployed a few things at first just to show how easy it is then he did a massive automated install of a load of different connected things. This kind of thing is important because it makes a lot of the boring tricky stuff easy. Also scaling is easier because you can easily add more when you  need.#Why is deploying services hard? What do you mean by services? You can see I am not very experienced with this kind of thing. Is it hard to do once, or is it hard to do 100 times?#Deploying a service isn't hard, if you know how to deploy that service. But say you need mutiple services working together, like a database, cache, app server and load balancer. Now you have to know how to deploy each of those *and* how to configure them to talk to eachother. If you have to scale up, you might have to repeat that multiple times for each service. You're talking days of sysadmin time, ever for an expert admin.Juju lets that expert define how to deploy each service once, so you don't have to know how. It also lets them define what they need to talk to other services, and what they give other services to talk to them. Finally it can use these two features to scale up and down without you having to change anything.So while a typical deployment might take an expert days to do, Juju lets a novice do it in minutes.#Well for instance you can deploy mongodb which is a database where you store data. With juju and Ubuntu you can with a click or a terminal command go from a blank machine like Mark said to an available and connected service to use in your server. With juju you can deploy scale and link together different services. Like deploy WordPress or drupal and then as your users start to put pressure on the server you can put more machines online.
cscareerquestions;3rae29;1446512105.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3rae29/nervousness_after_first_day_at_work_general/;Nervousness after first day at work.. general questions..;Hi all,So today was my first day at work. Felt great, I naturally woke up on time and survived a few hours without caffeine, so morning felt naturally nice.I am joining a highly specialised team, and everyone in my team is atleast a decade older than me with years ( not 4-5, way more) kick ass experience in their fields. They are veterans in those areas. Its awesome, but at the same time a little odd that I am the only new grad in my team. I mean they know I am right out of college, so I wasnt hired by mistake or anything. Still, I feel I dont know what expectations they will have? Everyone was amazingly nice though. My lunch with them... they were talking about family/kids/backyards..so basically mid forties kinda stuff (now dont bash me for saying mid-forties. Its just to give you an idea). They noticed me (25) obviously cannot meaningfully contribute, so they shifted the topic towards newer things like games, big data, and general stuff where I am from. Which was super nice of them...But still wondering, is this a good thing or a bad thing..Do you feel any special advantage of having co-workers around your age? Does that make a better cultural fit in anyway? ;"It's good. You've just surrounded yourself with some incredibly talented people.It's fun to work with people you can connect with. Age is a very small factor in that. Place in life is also a small factor in that. They're factors, but take advantage of what you have and hang out with friends/go to dev meetups/whatever outside of work :) just be happy you work with nice people who will teach you a lot!#[deleted]#It's nice to have coworkers your own age for camaraderie. But the older ones are the ones that can teach you the most. Some of each is good.#It is as good a thing as you make of it. :)  The important thing is your attitude towards it.  Obviously, in an ideal world, there will be great diversity within all age groups within a team.  That doesn't always happen.  In your case, that was really nice of them to shift the subject.  But you can also learn a lot from your coworkers professionally and socially.  I've learned so much about my industry and career field from older coworkers, as well as random things like child care, parenting, lawn care (!), house hunting (!!), retirement funding (!!!!).  To be able to receive the most benefit of your situation is to be engaged, asked questions (about work related and non-work related).  Be a good sport about ""before your time jokes.""  Be confident in what you know, but humble with what you don't know.  Be gracious of advice offered, but don't be afraid to voice your own opinions.  Show a genuine interest in learning what they know.#All that matter is if they are cool and will teach you things. if not, bail.#Those older vets usually love teaching people who are excited to learn, and they'll probably live vicariously through your stories.  I'm 26 and everyone I work with is just a bit over 30 with wives and kids and they love hearing about tinder. It obviously depends on the people but I enjoy it.  Not bad unless they're curmudgeons and unhappy.  As the new guy remember to respect their time and Google the shit out of questions before you ask them.  But also don't take hours stuck on something you know they know.  It's  a bit of a balance but you'll get a feel for it.#I'm starting my new job in a month and I'll be the youngest at 20 (will be 21 when I start tho) and I didn't feel too weird about it. Everyone was super nice, but they did threat me like a kid. They're super talented so I hope to learn a lot from them.#haha, so would you like having young/inexperienced people around? Like mentoring/talking them would be a hassle for you or...no?#> Like mentoring/talking them would be a hassle for you or...no?As long as you are:* Willing to listen* Asking intelligent questions which 90% of the time aren't answered by the first 2-3 hits on GoogleI welcome it.Reason: If someone asks me something, it:* Forces me to deepen (or reinforce) my own understanding.* Is probably an indication that I should be documenting it, either for the company or a blog post.And, a bit more selfishly...if I can't teach someone else about the stuff that I'm responsible for, I can't move on to other projects."

Research2. Internship3. Side projects4. Class projects5. Class material (taking topics like parallel programming, big data, ML, NLP, etc)I'm just wondering how I should best spend my time. I'm assuming internships can only be done over the summer, so what else can I do over the semester that will be most beneficial?;Internships are important and research helps as well. From what I've seen side projects help more than class projects, especially when they're live. Class material is not very relevant.#1. Good, but not necessary.2. Probably the most important thing on the resume.3. If your resume makes it past the recruiter/HR this becomes a very nice thing to have. Engineers love looking at your side projects as it shows experience, competency, and interest in what you are doing.4. Can take the place of an internship if you don't have any internship experience, but internships are still more valuable.5. I list my topics in a multi-column bulleted list on my resume. I think it's valuable as it gets you through many keyword filters that HR might have.I've had pretty good luck with my resume format. Here's what my resume looks like (related work experience is computer repair for me since that's what I did in high school and college during the year):https://i.imgur.com/B6PhGDi.png#GPA is important as well. Not as much for tech as it is for finance, but not nothing.#Would you say side projects are better than research then? Also, thanks for the resume format - that helps a lot.#It really depends on the company and it depends on the research. Recruiters look mostly for job experience and then the other two are about on the same level.If you have the opportunity to do research then do it because it helps to get to know professors well, but since you usually own your side projects from start to finish engineers sometimes like seeing that rather than working on someone else's decade long research project for a few months.
cscareerquestions;3pksmm;1445392455.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3pksmm/should_i_quit_my_job_at_big4/;Should I quit my job at Big4?;Hi guys, I know this question probably has been asked million times, so sorry in advance, but I'd really appreciate your help. For the last 3+ years I have been working at Big4 company in Greater Seattle Area and lately I totally hate it. I feel like I am not developing the new skills and the stack is not attractive to me (I am willing to switch to newer and better technologies, preferably in big data domain). Turns out, with my current job it's not easy to do, as I feel really demotivated and tired. At first considered common strategy - preparing for the interviews in the evenings and then trying to switch the jobs, but the thing is, it's really hard to do that when you feel exhausted after days of annoying and not fulfilling job. So right now, I am looking for some advice how to deal with this situation. Should I stay? Should I join some bootcamp to change stack? How to motivate myself? I am leaning towards quitting, learning for a couple of months and then applying for other jobs, but I am afraid that I won't be able to find something decent. So in a sense, I am stuck. Any advice on that? Thanks.;">Should I stay?No. I'm pretty sure a Big4 company would let you move around internally, but if the issues can't be solved by a simple stack & department change, it's time for you to leave.> Should I join some bootcamp to change stack? I understand being exhausted after work, but I have a hard time believing you can't carve out 4 or more hours a week to work on interview skills & maybe an easy side project in the stack you're interested in. I would never leave a job without having one lining up, but that's me. If you think you need a bootcamp, it's your time and your money.> How to motivate myself?  I am afraid that I won't be able to find something decent. Write down all the reasons you currently hate your job. Hang that list on your door so you can see it every morning when you leave for work. Use that list as a litmus for any other companies you interview with. You should be asking yourself if the new place solves most of the issues you left the big4 company. #yea, I'll take it off your hands for you... Obviously it's amazon, so you should know that amazon works people hard on mostly shitty stacks unless you get lucky coming in. I say switch jobs, there's a ton of companies in seattle that would be willing to have you, namely qualtrics, zillow, etc.#[deleted]#> I understand being exhausted after work, but I have a hard time believing you can't carve out 4 or more hours a week to work on interview skills & maybe an easy side project in the stack you're interested in.4 hours a week is not barely enough. I'd like to learn a lot of things, take several courses, solve 40-50 coding challenges. I guess if I did not work, I could accomplish it in 2-3 months.>If you think you need a bootcamp, it's your time and your money.Bootcamp is just a way to get into new stack quickly and with lot's of practice + networking. I doubt that they can make someone a dev from scratch but maybe it can be good for me, taking into account my experience and education? Currently I am looking at coding dojo, their program seems decent http://www.codingdojo.com/files/onsite_course_packet.pdf#[deleted]#How do you know it's Amazon? Not sure what the ""Big 4"" are, but Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google all have offices in the ""Greater Seattle Area""#I know it can sound like that, but no, it's not Amazon.#I do, exactly between 6 and 12 months. #Exactly, thank you. I am not someone who can work for 100 hours a week, I like reading and learning other things.

Have you heard anything about CSE 160?Thanks ;I'm a medium-data researcher whose formal CS education consists of a single undergraduate science/engineering C++ class. It was probably the most valuable course I ever took, even though I haven't used C++ since.Getting a formal introduction to data types and structures, logic, functions, objects, and program flow will give you a set of tools that will apply to any other language you're likely to use.R is something you'll pick up in a stats class along the way, and it will be even easier to learn R once you've become experienced with a general-purpose programming language.EDIT: [relevant](https://xkcd.com/1513/)#Genome 373 is a good python based intro class for this kind of thing#142 is java, so that might not be what you're looking for. I would suggest learning languages yourself. Python is fairly simple compared to some other languages and definitely doable. #It's worth noting that some of those concepts are covered in CSE 143 because they're meant to be taken as a series. A lot of data structures (stacks, queues, trees, maps, linked lists) are part of 143. #142 is also programming concepts. The skills transfer to other languages.#Huh! I've honestly never interacted with any of those data types/concepts. I imagine they're frequently built into the back end of array-centric scientific computing environments? In any case I'm revising down my belief in my own aptitude. Caveat emptor OP, and thanks /u/free_utils for the better advice.#Ahh yes, that is also true.

socialism;3q2o3c;1445720209.0;/r/socialism/comments/3q2o3c/drones_ibm_and_the_big_data_of_death/;Drones, IBM, and the Big Data of Death;;>In 2010, IBM employees delivered a talk at IBM’s Analytics Solution Center in Washington, D.C., titled “An Introduction to Edge Methods: Business Analytics and Optimization for Intelligence.” The audience was “the Defense and Intelligence communities,” and IBM’s goal was to explain to them how the company could help them with “managing large volumes of data” to derive “invaluable” insights. Among its already-existing governmental customers, IBM explained, was the ISR Task Force.>Although buried in reams of corporate management gobbledygook (IBM, it turns out, is “Mission Focused” and “Performance Driven”), the talk’s key theme was that IBM was offering prospective new government clients its “expertise in integrating business and technology services” using its “commercial consulting methods.” That is, IBM was bringing what it had learned from managing Big Data for corporate America to the military and intelligence worlds.>Keep that in mind as you examine the secret ISR study, and you’ll see that the Pentagon’s drone program uses data analytics in almost precisely the same way IBM encourages corporations to use it to track customers. The only significant difference comes at the very end of the drone process, when the customer is killed.

Personally, I search every 6 months or so, despite having a full time job. Up until I got this job, I would start looking roughly a month or so before students would graduate college/summer break to beat out any competition, as well as just before students would be going to college, in the event graduates applied to jobs rather than college. My theory was/is, that graduates were like me: they'd take the summer off to enjoy themselves, then rather than prepare for school/applying to schools as September approached they would apply for jobs. I think having that data would be nifty.

Transhuman;3p1gk1;1445030380.0;/r/Transhuman/comments/3p1gk1/self_study_need_help_developing_curriculum/;Self Study - Need Help Developing Curriculum;"Hello everybody, I am new to the community but I've been interested in transhumanism for about two years now. I am starting to study computer science in my own time, as out of the ""four pillar"" technologies (computer science, neurobiology, nanotechnology, genetics) computer science seems to be the easiest to manage without access to specialized equipment. The problem is I do not know really where to start.I have limited knowledge about computers, big data, machine learning, AI, etc. so I was wondering if anybody in the community could help me put together a basic curriculum for myself. I'd like to know what my knowledge base should be to start out with so I can learn the basics and start to develop an understanding of exactly where I want to take my studies.Any help at all would be very helpful and appreciated.";"The problem is that three of those four are specializations within a field.  As a physics student myself I wouldn't discourage anyone from studying those subjects, but just be warned that you're in for an enormous amount of work for a rather lengthy period of time.First, computer science.  You need to understand, first and foremost, that CS is not just programming and technology, it's an abstract and theoretical science.  It's an applied math field.  The kind of math you'll want to study is the ""discrete"" path.  That is, intro finite mathematics -> linear algebra -> combinatorics and mathematical logic -> number theory, abstract algebra, and calculus of finite differences.  Subfields like machine learning, data analysis (for which you will also need statistics), computer graphics, etc, all build on that mathematical base.  I strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with the C language (it's hard, but the kind of hard that makes you smarter) and a scientific language like MATLAB (this will cost you about $100), GNU Octave, or Python.Second, neurobiology.  You will need a solid grounding in chemistry, up to advanced organic chemistry and chemical kinetics, and cell biology.   You will also need physics up to electricity and magnetism (typically the second or third semester).  You will also need the traditional calculus sequence up to differential equations of a single variable.Genetics is one of the primary subfields of biology.  Most universities that offer biology degrees offer specialization in genetics, and they typically will make their curricula publicly viewable.Finally, nanotech.  This is where it gets really, really messy.  You will need physics up to relativistic quantum field theory (typically a graduate-level subject).  That is, general physics -> wave motion -> modern physics (intro special relativity, intro nuclear physics, intro quantum mechanics all rolled into one just utterly delightful semester) -> classical mechanics + electricity (the advanced sequence) -> optics + magnetism + statistical thermo -> intro quantum mechanics + special relativity -> condensed matter physics -> relativistic quantum field theory.  Mathematically, you will need the entire calculus sequence, followed by the entire differential equations sequence up to differential equations of multiple variables and complex analysis, along with the entire algebra sequence (linear algebra, one or two semesters' worth of modern algebra), differential geometry, Fourier analysis, integral transforms, statistics, functional analysis, topology, numerical analysis, and proof writing.  You will need chemistry up through organic chemistry, chemical kinetics, and physical chemistry.   This is where mastering a scientific computing language like MATLAB will come in most useful.If you're just starting college or thinking about attending, I would strongly suggest concentrating in a dual program consisting of two fundamental sciences.  Pick two among math, physics, chemistry, and biology.  CS is a fairly self-teachable subject these days, anyone can sign up for a CS class on Coursera and learn as much as you would like.  Expect to spend 5 years on your degree rather than the typical 4, and plan for graduate school.Speaking of Coursera, I would also highly recommend signing up for Massive Open Online Course platforms like Coursera and edx and staying on top of possibly interesting courses.What I would suggest doing, if you're certain you want to start ASAP (which you should, as this whole path will most likely take you many years), is getting your hands on some good college freshman level textbooks on calculus, physics, and chemistry.  Coursera routinely has relevant modules open in those areas.  I also suggest signing up for a forum like Physics Forums and participating in conversations, since trying to learn entirely on your own is unproductive at best and dangerous at worst.I hope that helps you.  Best of luck.#It really depends on what your motivation is.  I got a really broad (but not deep) understanding of computer science by changing my major so many times (programming, engineering, routing protocols, and probably a few things I forgot).  Having a good working understanding of how computers work from the logic-gate level all the way up to the OSI stack and a basic understanding of routing protocols is something I value.   But now, as a person with a 10 year old child, I try to stay up on technology trends so that the knowledge and wisdom I pass on to her remains relevant.  If you're just looking to be an educated member of the transhumanist community rather than pushing the technology forward, I'd recommend starting with rationality and transhumanist philosophy.  I suggest reading Bostrom and Yudkowsky especially. Kurzweil I find frustrating, but it's worth knowing what he says since a lot of people who know nothing else have heard of him and you'll probably want to be able to talk about him.    I'd also recommend a literature component to your studies.  Look into transhumanist fiction.  Examining other people's views can help you develop your own.  None of this is to say studying pure science isn't worth it in it's own right, but I don't feel like my Differential Equations classes made me a better transhumanist.  And here's a few links just in case you haven't come across them:http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.htmlhttp://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/simplified/http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequenceshttp://hpmor.com/#Learn lab and practical skills for molecular biology, neurophysiology, electronics, CNC equipment, chemistry. Access to specialized equipment is not always necessary, for example see the at-home biology people (diybio) who have managed to hack together basic, calibrated equipment. Seek and find good mentors that possess the skills and similar results to what you're aiming for. Avoid LW because their goals are more like rationality commenting and AI xrisk prevention through fiction, which is somewhat not the same as transhumanist technology goals."
cscareerquestions;3pqedm;1445488370.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3pqedm/bs_in_computer_science_stuck_with_mainframe_and/;BS in Computer Science. Stuck with Mainframe and some generic SQL/Shell Script/Autosys work and want to get out. How? Where?;"As the title suggests, I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science and I'M working in the US primarily as a Mainframe developer. I've been working for an Indian ""IT"" company for about 6 years now and the ""client"" I'm working for has a bit of Mainframe maintenance work and I also fill in as a ""generic"" resource to work on some basic SQL/ShellScripts/Autosys jobs kinda work.All the work that I do is repetitive - as in things break and I have to look at the logs/whatever and try to fix it. It's one of those jobs where you reach a certain point after which everything seems ""more of the same"". I get paid $65k a year and I'm on the East Coast.After giving it much thought (and being quite lazy about it too) I've finally decided that I've had enough and I'm planning to move on. I'm hoping I will at the very least increase my yearly salary if not anything else. However in an ideal world, I want to get away from being tagged as a mainframe developer but I wouldn't know what else to pursue. I'm no good in Java/Python/ETL tools/a lot of the other ""hot trends"" like Big Data/Hadoop etc. Which one of java/python/C++ or some ETL tools or something else would help me sell myself to a hiring manager? Or is there a completely different option which I've obviously not thought of, that is better in terms of my career?";You can escape. You have my sympathies, I was in your shoes several years ago.I like /u/billibus_maximus 's advice. Playing to your strengths is a good thing and a transitional job would be perfect.If you can't find this kind of work, another straightforward path out is to learn Python or Ruby for back-end web development (i.e. Django or Rails). You can claim that you *really* understand databases, unlike these kids that don't know what the ORM is doing  ) A basic way to make yourself hire-able:* If you can get away with it (don't ask just do), start scripting some things in Python or Ruby at work. The languages both have a very friendly learning curve.* Once you know the basics, set aside some time and work through some Django/Rails tutorials at home.* Build two or three personal web-apps that you can show off to a hiring manager. Anything simple, an expenses tracker, an exercise planner, an app to list and rate the books you are reading or want to read. Put them live somewhere and link to them on your CV/cover letter.This will still take a lot of work, but unless you do something nobody will ever tap you on the shoulder and give you a better job. Sadly many companies are happy to let your skills rot until you are completely unemployable elsewhere.See also on this theme https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2015/09/how-to-be-awesome/#Just as the other comment said, big companies are looking for mainframe developers. When I went in for my interview at american express the interviewer looked at my resume and saw that I had mainframe experience and asked me about it. He said that he was looking for mainframe people who work in COBOL and that he was paying good money for these positions. I think youre undervaluing your skills.

investing;3qorq9;1446116052.0;/r/investing/comments/3qorq9/apple_should_buy_a_university/;Apple Should Buy a University;Apple has more than $205 billion in cash. What should they do with the money? Apple should buy a university and rebuild it from the ground up.In recent years, some private equity firms have bought universities and turned them into for-profits. Apple is a for-profit corporation not a charity but there are plenty of ways to make money from a non-profit university. Aside from the tax breaks and other deductions, Apple University would be a proving ground for educational technologies that would be sold to every other university in the world. New textbooks built for the iPad and its successors would greatly increase the demand for iPads. Apple-designed courses built using online technologies, a.i. tutors, and virtual reality experimental worlds could become the leading form of education worldwide. Big data analytics from Apple University textbooks and courses would lead to new and better ways of teaching. As a new university, Apple could experiment with new ways of organizing degrees and departments and certifying knowledge. Campuses in Delhi, Seoul, Shanghai, Berlin, and Sao Paulo could provide opportunities for studying abroad. Apple’s reputation would attract top students, especially, for example, if it started with a design and business school. Top students would lead Apple University to be highly ranked. The more prestigious Apple University became the greater would be the demand for Apple University educational products.Apple already has the beginning of this model with iTunes U and its own internal Apple University for training in business and design. By buying a university, Apple would commit to a learning process to develop these technologies in entirely new ways.Sounds great, huh?;This is a bad idea for multiple reasons, not the least of which is that for profit universities are generally seen as scams. Moreover, they recruit top talent from (the best) already existing schools so they dont have a shortage of workers. And also, I seriously doubt that the Return on capital would be worth the costs. I think they should use their funds for innovation and growth.#The dumbest thing I've heard all week, and there was a debate on last night.#[deleted]#To be clear OP ripped this off from marginal revolution: http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/10/apple-should-buy-a-university.html#Hell, spend $250 Mn, build a building and start a new department of technology in education at Stanford, which already has the 3rd highest ranked education department, great programs in computer science and software engineering, and of course, it's also right down the road.

I will have to use MCMC methods, and it's initially expected that it will be done in R.However, since I already know how to program in python a bit, I was wondering how the PyMC packages compare to R's MCMC packages? I know Python is the big thing in science, it's got great libraries that probably can't really be surpassed in many areas, however I ask this because frankly, I don't know a huge amount about MCMC and Bayesian analysis, I'm going to have to learn it as I go. So I'm not yet able to decide whether I should start learning R or if Python would be perfectly fine for most cases.Sorry if it's in the wrong board, wasn't sure if I should post to learnpython or here.;In my opinion, Pymc 3 is best in class for MCMC bayesian modeling.Its easier to use, has more samplers and is more flexible to extend than R's stan.It also allows you to manipulate DAGs, which stan doesn't do...and in python. Whereas stan you have to do write string of a wierd C++ dsl.Python is also faster in general, and you can get up to almost C speeds with the Numba compiler: https://github.com/numba/numba Useful for writing your own samplers. Here are some Pymc resources: https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/getting_started/ http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2014/03/17/bayesian-glms-3/https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/hierarchical/Keep in mind the blogpost is a bit old, so there are probably syntax changes.#[deleted]#Interesting.

personalfinance;3qha3a;1445983932.0;/r/personalfinance/comments/3qha3a/help_evaluating_job_offer/;Help Evaluating Job Offer;I currently work as a Software Engineer for a fortune 100 financial institution in Phoenix, AZ.  My currently salary is in the 55-65k range (using ranges for added anonymity) before yearly performance bonuses.  My current position is very comfy (read 100% job security until the day I retire) and has a very lax work/life balance.  I recently had an opportunity arise to interview for a ~10 year old tech/security government consulting company/start up (about 100 employees in size) in the Columbia/Elliot City, MD area and was fortunate to receive an offer.  This offer is for substantially more pay, in the higher end of the 80 - 90k range.  This consulting company seems like a dream place work, they work with emerging/bleeding edge tech, and seem to be very employee focused in terms of personal development and have a great work life balance too - probably not as relaxed as my current position.  I also currently live with my long-time SO, she currently works in a position outside of her degree field making ~35-40k a year, and however the job prospects for the field her degree is in is much better in Maryland.  I'm trying to make a decision on what is our best call here, we are very early in our careers and are all but fresh out of college.  Some pros and cons additional info about the offer and my current position:**Current Position*** Includes a fully funded pension upon retirement* Fairly easy to climb the corporate ladder pending you work hard, are polite and kind, and can handle some light office politics.* Would take 4-5 years to reach 85k at current company.* 401(k) match leaves much to be desired.  Will match up to $900, and automatically contributes $300 for a total of $1200 per year. 401k currently with Vanguard.* Work with some less than exciting tech, and deal with a lot of bureaucracy and red tape**New Position*** If I contribute 8% they’ll match 5% to 401(k) with T. Rowe Price* Would have to get my TS Security Clearance (very valuable in my field)* Much closer to home and friends SO and I grew up in this region* Work with Big Data/Cloud analytics and Security which is a quickly growing field in the tech industry, especially in the government sector.* Profit sharing in Employee Stock Ownership Plan targeted at 8% of employees compensation + bonus* Will pay for gym/health club memberships and activities up to a certain capBoth companies will be pay for tuition reimbursement however the new company will pay double what my current company will (I plan to seek my MBA in the future).  Other benefits are about equivalent but the new company’s Health insurance includes an HSA.  Sorry if my this was very jumbled, I'm very excited and anxious about this - what is everyone’s thoughts?  Thanks! ;Software engineer with TS here. Your salary is too low for a software engineer, even considering you are a new grad, take the new position. The TS will also give you a lot of job security.#Phoenix has a lot lower cost of living than MD, and a huge chunk of your extra salary would go towards increased living expenses (especially should you decide to buy a house)Since you are young, and with that probably more willing to take risks, I would probably choose the new job. New jobs comes with higher risks, but also higher potential rewards. If you were settled with house and kids, staying in PHX would be better. #Hey thanks for responding, could you detail the process of getting the TS?  Also, the thing that makes me the most nervous is leaving the comfort of my current job - I think the new position and company will offer a very similar company culture but they are young and growing, they already went through an acquisition process and decided it wasn't for them, but the idea of that happening is somewhat scary and intimidating.#You're young and just starting your career. You need to start working on developing your experience breadth, learning new technologies and programs, and how different companies and teams work. Diversify and grow. Now is not the time in your career to get comfortable and stagnate. You say you have a job for life, but really no one knows how long your company will be around for. If your company has massive layoffs 15 years from now and you're a 40 year old software engineer who's only ever worked on the same code, same program, same company, you may find yourself unhireable.The TS process is not bad. You will fill out an SF86 (just be very honest), a selection of your friends, family, neighbors and acquaintances past and present will be questioned on your trustworthiness, and you will be interviewed on what you wrote on your SF86. Be completely honest and you will be fine. TS's take a while to process, 6 months to 2 years but your new company may have you start on outside work while you wait.

Entrepreneur;3oy6nn;1444968638.0;/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3oy6nn/consulting_side_gig_while_fully_employed/;Consulting side gig while fully employed?;[deleted];"Well if your time is so limited, especially during business hours, then you may need to rethink what big data ""consulting"" means here. You don't have to offer the whole enchilada, so to speak. Ask yourself, who is your ideal customer and what is their biggest pain point they need help with? Can you create a product or one off service to address the issue? Or create a process that you manage but can outsource? Break it all down and focus on one thing that they really need. Then create something that addresses this issue that can be replicated and possibly outsourced. A one and done deliverable that doesn't require your attention past the initial needs assessment and/or data dump. For example, so many companies now are overwhelmed by all of their big data caches that executives can't make heads or tails of it. You can come in and take a portion of their data and do data visualization. By visually grouping together many data points, creating graphs and what not, they can now see the relationship between data points or figure what to focus on. You can niche it down to doing this for a specific industry and/or customer type. Or create a point of sale data collection system that in turn visualizes the data for small businesses and sell that. For example, a dry cleaner with this product will now be able to see at the click of a button each day, week or month, their hourly traffic flow, sales data, how many pieces per customer on average,  the geographical radius of their customers  (i.e they all live within a 1 mile radius, or live all over the place but work within a 10 minute walk) etc... Mind you the above may be horrible ideas or outside your intended scope,  I don't know, they are simply off the top of my head examples used to illustrate my point. Finding that niche customer and/or product will take some trial and error. You have to go out there and ask potential customers questions and see who pays you at least, I dunno, what $100?, for whatever beta product you come up with and go from there. Develop it a little more with each new customer and continual feedback.#Your time clash concerns are spot on. It's an when-not-if that eventually your side business that is in the same space would begin to clash or overlap with your full time gig. Your boss and peers are likely smart people and will notice this. I have about 15 direct reports, and if I caught any one of them conducting their own business on my company's time, my first thought is, well how much have they been getting away with that I haven't seen? Where do their priorities lie? They'd get a warning/ultimatum that day, and if it happens again, that would be it. This policy is spelled out explicitly in our company handbook as well.If you really care about your job, tread carefully.#Several years ago I just dove off the cliff - I understand where you are at right now. Here's my advice...I think your focused on the wrong problem. Finding people who are willing to pay you money is the challenge. Once you have figured out a reliable method for finding those people, what do you need the day job for?You're presumably already an expert at the service you intend to provide/consult on. If you can also become an expert at marketing yourself and figuring out how to find paying customers, everything else can fall in to place. Here's one dumb idea. Let's say you were going to generate leads through your website via PPC. You could use an appointment scheduling app, take advantage of time zone differences to schedule off hours for you (but on for the client), and then only market to that time zone.So if you're on the East Coast, your calendar only allows for appointments between 5:00 and 9:00pm. You only market to the west coast, so you have availability between 2:00 and 6:00pm every day for new leads to book calls. "

I was always the kid who loved planes, then I became the kid who fixed everyone's tech problems (mostly software-based, I never actually worked much with hardware but I definitely knew my way around figuring out if the problem was in the hardware or software, I just never wanted to void my warranties). I did always take it upon myself to fix things (though generally I was only permitted to mess with the technology because no one else in my family knew how to fix them), and as a young kid I designed stuff in my head, but I grew frustrated with being unable to draw my designs very well, so I turned to improving my communication skills so I could convey the ideas verbally. Now, after spending some time in school thinking about astrophysics and still occasionally thinking about robotics engineering, I've been pursing CS. I enjoy CS because I like watching my programs come to life, I love seeing a bunch of characters on a page suddenly become a beautiful entity. I've never been bad at math, but I've also not responded to the typical math teaching style of ""here is two hours worth of how to solve these specific equations but I'm not going to actually explain the thought process of how to solve problems."" I love creating, possibilities, and puzzles. To the best of my understanding, CS is the most fitting for this style of interest  that said, I'm not particularly interested in many of the more traditional CS puzzles. Making my own video games, software for meaningless drivel applications (Who really needs twitter. Like, why. What is the point?), these are the type of things that sound like the most boring, useless, meaningless wastes of a lifetime to me. Big data and cloud computing are one slight step up, but thoroughly uninspiring for me. I made my own website in HTML, which I'm still working on and I've actually enjoyed, but I've noticed a lot of the programming challenges interest me because of their novelty, in addition to the fact they're useful to me. Once I've solved the puzzles once and created the idea (of course you do have to fix all the bugs, which I also enjoy doing, that's part of solving the puzzle), I don't have any desire to do that puzzle again (in essence, I'm saying despite the fact I enjoyed making my own website, I don't think I would enjoy web development). The problem for me is I simply don't find programming *interesting.* I enjoy it, but I'm just not that interested in it. This is a major area of concern for me, because I'm aware that programming is a life-long learning process, and I don't know if I'd be interested enough to seek out new techniques and languages on my own time (unless as part of personal projects, which I do have several ideas for when I get some time).So, I've been doing a lot of soul searching. The best thing I've come up with is I believe I would enjoy combining my love of aircraft with my love of CS, to write programs for NASA or SpaceX or other Aerospace companies. I'm not *only* interested in aerospace, but to be perfectly frank I feel much more at home working with the engineers (at least at my school) than I feel working with the CS majors, and when I have thought about it in depth, I'd like to be the guy who does the programming end engineering. I reached this conclusion by, in the course of considering Robotics Engineering, considering what role I would like to be (or be most comfortable) in charge of if I were to participate in engineering competitions. I am a third year, but current plan is to get a BS in CS and minor in Astrophysics. UCSC doesn't have AE or ME  we only have EE, CE, Robitics Engineering (though to be fair, our RE is mostly just CE with a couple statics and dynamics classes attached), and CS.TL DRI think I have a pretty good idea of what I want to do (programming for engineering and preferably aerospace) but I don't know the best way to go for it.This, however, presents a few issues:1.

MachineLearning;3pn3wt;1445440081.0;/r/MachineLearning/comments/3pn3wt/is_increasing_the_number_of_epochs_for_less_data/;Is increasing the number of epochs for less data same as using more data with less number of epochs, while training a Neural network?;I was wondering that one of the major arguments made against using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is that they require large amounts of data to train on. However, when we look at the implementation of an ANN, then we see that there is no term which defines how many data points we need to train on. In fact, one of the major parameters to tune are the regularization terms and the number of epochs (or iterations). Also, it has been shown that ANN are universal approximators, and they can learn functions like XOR using small data but enough epochs. So, building on that shouldn't it be possible for an ANN to learn using a small data set, of the order which is used by SVMs, Logistic Regressions (which can all be represented as ANN), e.g. 20k instances for binary sentiment analysis. What are some limitations of using ANN for small data, e.g. Iris data with ~100 instances, movie reviews data ~20k instances etc?Doesn't small data (Order of 1000) with 1000 times more epochs equals big data (Order of 10^6), when it comes to training neural networks? (In understand there is not going to be enough diversity in the smaller data compared to larger data);"In short no, because the DNN is seeing the same data over and over again. The reason why problems like iris and xor can be learnt with small amounts of data is because they are very simple. Complex functions, like mapping the pixels of an image to the number (MNIST) or sentiment analysis will need much more data in order to be learnt properly. Just think about the number of dimensions in the input space: iris has 3, xor has 2 and MNIST has images with 26x26 pixels. There is just a lot of possible values for the pixels that represent a given number, so you will need a lot of examples of that number. The same goes for words and more complex problems, and simply increasing the number of iterations won't do it.The difference in complexity between SVMs and DNNs lies in the number of parameters. In the SVM you have the alpha coefficients, and there is one per example (although many are going to be 0), while in a DNN you will usually have many more (think about the huge weight matrices). Depending on the problem one is going to be better than the other.#To add to what /u/sk006 just said, you can't compensate for ""not enough data"" by training more and more. It is like watching the same mooc about neural networks over nd over again, hoping that at some point you will know what the history of religions is. You'd better watch the mooc about the history of religion once.On the other hand, the opposite is also true. Having 1000 lectures about the same topic doesn't help more than 100 lectures. On the other hand, actively listening to them instead of playing video games at the back of the room will teach you stuff  )Hope the analogy helps.#The problem with a small dataset is overfitting.In other words: You will learn *something* this way, but that something may not be what you want to learn. As you train over and over on the same data, your network will move more and more towards memorizing it rather than extracting useful generalizations. When you then try to apply your network to new test data, you'll get terrible results because your network basically only knows how to recognize an input and regurgitate the answer."

Projects range from software development, app support, big data, QA, business intelligence, etc. From my experience (~2 years out of college now), some of my peers don't mind the constant shift in tech but others dread it (they'd like to focus on a certain tech stack for example).I do not have an affinity to any particular tech stacks (Microsoft, Oracle, Angular vs .NET, etc), but I do enjoy architecting and solving problems based on requirements and selecting the appropriate stack.My question is, what are your thoughts on tech consulting career prospects?

My currently salary is in the 55-65k range (using ranges for added anonymity) before yearly performance bonuses.  My current position is very comfy (read 100% job security until the day I retire) and has a very lax work/life balance.  I recently had an opportunity arise to interview for a ~10 year old tech/security government consulting company/start up (about 100 employees in size) in the Columbia/Elliot City, MD area and was fortunate to receive an offer.  This offer is for substantially more pay, in the higher end of the 80 - 90k range.  This consulting company seems like a dream place work, they work with emerging/bleeding edge tech, and seem to be very employee focused in terms of personal development and have a great work life balance too - probably not as relaxed as my current position.  I also currently live with my long-time SO, she currently works in a position outside of her degree field making ~35-40k a year, and however the job prospects for the field her degree is in is much better in Maryland.  I'm trying to make a decision on what is our best call here, we are very early in our careers and are all but fresh out of college.  Some pros and cons additional info about the offer and my current position:**Current Position*** Includes a fully funded pension upon retirement* Fairly easy to climb the corporate ladder pending you work hard, are polite and kind, and can handle some light office politics.* Would take 4-5 years to reach 85k at current company.* 401(k) match leaves much to be desired.  Will match up to $900, and automatically contributes $300 for a total of $1200 per year. 401k currently with Vanguard.* Work with some less than exciting tech, and deal with a lot of bureaucracy and red tape**New Position*** If I contribute 8% they’ll match 5% to 401(k) with T. Rowe Price* Would have to get my TS Security Clearance (very valuable in my field)* Much closer to home and friends SO and I grew up in this region* Work with Big Data/Cloud analytics and Security which is a quickly growing field in the tech industry, especially in the government sector.* Profit sharing in Employee Stock Ownership Plan targeted at 8% of employees compensation + bonus* Will pay for gym/health club memberships and activities up to a certain capBoth companies will be pay for tuition reimbursement however the new company will pay double what my current company will (I plan to seek my MBA in the future).  Other benefits are about equivalent but the new company’s Health insurance includes an HSA.  Sorry if my this was very jumbled, I'm very excited and anxious about this - what is everyone’s thoughts?  Thanks! ;
