guns;865d11;1521663004.0;/r/guns/comments/865d11/external_rgundeals_community/;External r/gundeals community;Hello there members of gunnit! As I'm sure is the same case with many of you I tried to get my fix of the best gun deals today only to find that the subreddit has been banned. I'm toying with the idea of trying to create a replacement website for r/gundeals. I know there are other aggregators out there, but at least in my experience r/gundeals was easily the best. I'm a professional software engineer (more in the big data space, but I know my way around AWS fairly well). Would other devs on r/guns be interested in participating? Open to discussion and suggestions!___________Edit- I've bought a web domain. After chatting with a friend who does web-dev work I got the recommendation to use Nginx backed by NodeJS. Open to discussion on the tech stack! My goal would be to make a site with more or less identical functionality to reddit, with upvoting comments/posts etc. ____Edit2- I have a discord server up now for any devs who want to discuss options. PM me for the link_________Edit3- signing off for the night, will respond to PMs tomorrow._____________Edit4- Please don't ask to join the discord channel if you just want to monitor progress :/. We're looking for contributors!_______________Edit5- Discord channel is getting pretty noisy. We're going to hold off on inviting anyone else in until we can get things organized. All the support is much appreciated!!;"I enjoyed gun deals because it was an easy way to get quick reviews and to find out if the deal was a deal worth jumping on.#Gun.deals is close but I'm sad to see that subreddit go.  It was a great community#Please do. There’s no reason to let this community dissolve because of arbitrary virtue signaling.#I'm a professional software engineer of 3 years, with experience in Swift/Objective-C/PHP/Python/Go. I wouldn't mind working on a 2nd amendment-safe gundeals platform. Hell, I wouldn't mind even working on a platform that combined deals AND videos (since YouTube is now banning gun videos).  EDIT: Send me a PM if you'd like to collaborate on something.#Yes! Okay  The best part of gundeals was twofold  1) generally, members would post deals they were looking for/thought were good and more members could vote on the deal. This worked out well for visibility as well as affirmation that this is okay to blow my money on  2) the comments would let you know about the product or about the seller. Which also helped in your confidence when buying.   These 2 things worked beautifully. If there is anyway to vote and comment on gundeals, COUNT ME IN #Fuck you reddit you fascist cocksuckers#Hell, I'd be willing to pay a buck-or-two/month to have access to a good website doing what gundeals did.  gunnit.com's domain is open.#call it r.gundeals.net?#I saw a fourm death turn into a huge business opportunity.    GON (Georgia Outdoor News) had a very active buy/sell section of it's chat forum some years ago.  They took the very short sighted view of shutting it down because moderating was becoming a hassle.  A very smart guy opened The Outdoors Trader.  It is mainly a GA site but it gets incredible traffic and was born by word of mouth advertising.  If you want a p2p gun deal in GA it is the #1 place to shop now.  Somebody around here ought to seize the opportunity to make something better than the GunDeals shit fest.    Gun sales are down right now but give it a couple of years...#[deleted]#Wow I just got back from vacation and am completely blown away. What happened that caused Reddit to ban gundeals? That's like 95% of my interest with Reddit. I'm so disillusioned and disappointed with reddit right meow. #I am not a software or programming guru or anything of the sort but as I relatively new firearm owner who enjoyed perusing /gundeals I am quite frustrated in the banning of a sub that linked goods offered by legitimate firearms dealers and offered 2a advocates and arms enthusiasts a place to gather and discuss.   I am here to do anything I can to help.   Sidenote: Fuck reddit's communist leftist bullshit. #Very sad about the closure of gun deals. Going to be a much more expensive hobby now. Going to be spending a lot less time on Reddit.#I'm also a software developer. It would be awesome to help out here, although I work primarily in the .NET ecosystem. #Can we get a FUCK /u/spez ?#reddit's source code as of the last update (last year) is still available on github, which may simplify things quite a bit for you.  https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit#They fucking shut down r/gundeals?! No wonder I couldn't get it to load today. What kind of fucking bullshit is this?!#Why was it banned?#Would totally appreciate something like this, but how would ppl find out about it? I'll prob delete my Reddit due to their crap, but am still looking for other sites like gun deals first. Hell, I'll make a temp private gun deals fb group if anyone even still uses fb#Can’t we just make an app??#App engineer and sysadmin checking in - pm'd. #Can we start a patreon or something so we can help fund this? I loved browsing /r/gundeals and /r/gunsforsale. #[deleted]#DevOps/Eng/Big Data for a Fortune 50. I know people that can help. I set up a Discord, but it seems you did as well.  What can I do to help?  https://discord.gg/rPHfd6y  Hop on over to Discord and build a community. Let’s make this happen.#You could always make a discord and have only mod approved posts and links go into a ""gun deals"" channel on there#I wouldnt mind helping, but I have limited html5, css, and javascript skills. Can also help by sharing ideas and so on#What can we do to help? I only have basic IT skills and a little network.#It's not about the technical aspects, or the development.  Software, domain names, hosting don't really matter.  gun.deals (aka slickguns) exists, but that's just aggregating.  What made /gundeals so good was the community.  The discussions, comments, vendor posts, etc.  Creating a new website won't bring that back.  The community was large because of the larger draw of Reddit.  An unknown website just won't have that.   Voat would seem like a logical choice, but it seems they only have one hamster wheel powering the server.  The thing grinds to a halt every time Reddit bans a sub and people look at voat.  If voat worked better, and better organized to seem more professional, it could be the place to grow.   Reddit is just going to keep banning more subs that don't fit the leftist narrative.  Voat feels more like the first attempt at recreating Reddit, like, it feels like it's running on a server in some dude's basement.  A well developed, cohesive, marketable Reddit replacement is needed like yesterday.  Not just the technical development, but brand, logo, name development.  It has to be catchy, memorable, and functional.  Then it needs subs with content, moderation, activity.  Then it needs to be mentioned EVERYWHERE.  Not just for Reddit refugees, but marketed as truly free speech without censorship.   OK, so a new site could work, but it needs to be done right.  Just throwing up ANOTHER website without all the other components has been tried and they never get any momentum.#Be careful, they might decide that with this post you are facilitating the facilitation of facilitating the sale of legal firearms and that's against their rules there buddy.#While I used to do a lot more programming back in the day I am more of in a PM/Director role right now in my job.  I will offer to lead the project and get the project organized and off the ground and running up on infrastructure.#Every subreddit worth visiting has disappeared in the past week.  So long Reddit, thanks for all the downvotes.#Anyone consider using MeWe?   'no ads, no tracking, no BS, #not4sale' is their tag line..     The last time I was in there, I needed vaccinations when I came back out, but maybe our community's ""signal to noise"" ratio would be high enough to keep a group 'on topic'. #I'll throw in my software experience into the ring as well. I've seen some pretty good site skimmers when it came to gamestop where people were making thousands in store credit a month just my looking at multiple sites and checking resale value.  I'm sure the same can be done with other firearm related websites and hooked into a bot that will post what it finds#And yet SRS is free to insult, harass, and tell people to kill themselves all day long. Fuck /u/spez.#Make a gofund me and I'll donate to help with costs. I need somewhere to declare ""in for three"" and not feel bad about my decision. #r/GunCoupons maybe?  Edit: someone just made that one 7 hours ago.  lol#Maybe this ends up being a good thing after the dust settles. U/limeygunner and his team get a website going and companies reach out with deals for promo on the website. Stuff like vendor ratings and other useful info can be built vendor profiles or maybe something like that.  I have no computer skills but if there is anyway a normal guy can give you a hand u/limeygunner reach out at anytime!#Fuck the mods.#This needs to happen.  I don't think I'm going to be able to tolerate voat.  Place is a shithole.  And I know if I can't stand it, you all sure as hell won't be able to stand it.#If you build it I will come.#Will the Reddit snu be changing to the virtue signaling snowflake now as well? Asking for a friend.#https://voat.co/v/Gundeals#[deleted]#Freedom hating communist cucks #I had the same idea but lack the skills needed. Sounds like it would work well.#I'd love to have that and r/gunsforsale all in one...  find good retail deals and use the sale area to pay for all the stuff I just bought! #I do Javascript/Typescript, angular, .net, and MS sql. About 3 years professional experience.  I've thought about writing my own forum but honestly would it be easier just to get some pre-made stuff?#I am unsure what I can offer, but considering my tremendous love of r/gundeals I'm more than happy to learn, contribute labor, or even contribute money towards paying for a new community#I know a few programming languages and would love to get back into programming.  I’m currently a help desk tech.  #If you make a new gun deals and possibly guns for sale page, I'll be one of the first to sign up.#I'd love if there is a historical low functionality when given a upc or manufacturer model. would be excellent for that.#Comment and saved for later #Plz I'm starting to itch #I just wanted to say that you’ll definitely get my traffic if it’s set up like the original r/gundeals. As others have said I really enjoyed the community feel to it and the ability for others to tell you wether or not it was actually a good deal. #Operatorchan.org#u/limeygunner I'm more than happy to help out with development/server costs and/or a monthly fee.#Saving for future hopes.#I'm taking the money I saved on r/gundeals and putting toward gun organizations now. All of them. #Maybe a subreddit for general collaboration and sharing ideas for creating new sites?#Definitely interested. I'd be willing to chip in on domain costs too if it meant having gun deals back#Spread the word. We have a discord server to help out with deals and such. Hey OP, maybe add this to the original post?   https://discord.gg/9KuQja5#You have got to be fucking kidding me, what the fucking fuck #Can we do a discord #What is the domain so I can save it? Also where do you plan on providing updates?    This may have been mentioned but, it would be great if there was a place I could go that would wrap YouTube & reddit into one clean functioning website created by people who stand up for the constitution and what this country was founded on. I’m definitely looking forward to this new community  keep us updated. #The nice thing about /r/gundeals is that it wasn't greatly known outside of this community and a few others. Don't know what others think about this idea but I like the idea of either invites or a Ranking system/reputation that way it doesn't just get destroyed!#I'm not interested in being a dev, but I'm all in for joining the community! #I'm not really a great web dev i've only dabbled a little bit but if there's anyway I can help I'm game!#this is amazing! thank you!#not all heroes wear capes /u/limeygunner  I appreciate you#This will probably get buried, but just to let you guys know I'm a learning software dev and would love any chance I can get to get some real-world experience in coding and web development, especially with something I'm passionate about.  If there's anything I can do to help the team, I'd love to learn more in how I can do so.#Fairly skilled with PowerShell scripting and some python and bash. Give me a shout if you need someone to automate mundane bullshit#Can't someone just make a new one with a different, less conspicuous name? #>My goal would be to make a site with more or less identical functionality to reddit, with upvoting comments/posts   Call it Voat.co#Www.Voat.com/v/gundeals#Just start posting gun.deals to T_D.

learnprogramming;84v9h8;1521205529.0;/r/learnprogramming/comments/84v9h8/java_or_c_which_should_i_use_to_learn_more_inside/;Java or C#? Which should I use to learn? More inside.;I read the best way to learn programming is to have projects in mind you want to work on, or build out as you learn - to enforce the material and methods. I have no interest in web dev, or big data or anything. I just want to build good ol' fashion desktop apps and maybe some games. The most obvious choices I think for that is Java (and then spring or JavaFX) or C#. Here is what I know so far: Java is is gigantic. It's everywhere and thus, quality, free learning material is available everywhere. The Java ecosystem is mostly free (the IDE, the frameworks etc) and it's platform agnostic. My thoughts on it: The IDE's are simple enough (eclipse anyway is easy to get around) and I have a good udemy course to work through. The company I work for, half of our corporate stack is built off Java so I have a chum to use as a resource when I get stuck. Java is good for desktop app programming. Games? I'm not so sure. However, the added bonus is if I get bored or want to expand/pivot, I have Android development at my reach. C#: The other half of my corporate environment is getting heavy into the MS Stack. All our new projects are hosted on Azure. We have MS partnership status. I have access to Visual Studio, and all the neat MS tools. I have access to other friends who work on the 'new' side to lean on for help. C# and Visual Studio are apparently easy to use for desktop application building, but more importantly once I get my core fundamentals down, I can start looking at things like Unity to build fun games with - which there are a TON of info on. However, C# is significantly smaller than Java (as far as I know anyway) so it sort of feels like I might be pidgen-holing myself into somewhat of a niche?I feel that the QUALITY of my learning experience, and learning core, fundamental programming techniques will probably come better through the use of Java. I think going through C# might be too purpose-driven...if that makes sense. But I'm very interested in learning how to make desktop apps and games as a time-consuming hobby. I have full blown access to both, to in-person support and a list of core projects I want to look into. I just don't know where to start - or with which language/stack? Thanks so much! edit: I didn't expect this to get as much traction as it did. Thanks to everyone who gave input! I'm trying out C# tonight. Will report back Monday with how far I got and what I think. ;"C# is not small.  You can't go wrong with either one.  They are almost the same language. If you know Java, you can switch to C# quite easily and the other way as well. #>However, C# is significantly smaller than Java (as far as I know anyway)  It's ""significantly smaller"" in the way that Target might be significantly smaller than WalMart. There are still Targets everywhere. Java is everywhere, but .NET isn't actually that far behind, and it will only continue growing now that .NET Core is taking off.  >I think going through C# might be too purpose-driven...if that makes sense  It really doesn't. I don't know what point you're trying to make here. C# and Java are relatively similar languages, especially at the learner's level. What one language will teach you about ""fundamental programming techniques"" the other will.  I'm  hyping C# because I'm a C# developer by trade (though I've done a lot more Javascript lately). But the truth is, you literally can't make a wrong choice between the two. They're both powerhouses in the industry.#If you're interested in going into development as a career, look at job postings in your area. I went to a bootcamp that has two locations. The location I went to taught us C# because that's what the market is like in my area. The location two hours away from me teaches Java because that's the market over there. Both are great options, but knowing what your area needs could give you some insight.#C#   for games you have Unity, Godot, Duality Engine, Otter 2D, Xenko game engine, and monogame     you can build desktop apps and connect to any database   Visual Studio community edition is free and has everything you'll need   there are tons of tutorials on youtube   C# is the easy choice I think #Do C# first. They are very similar, but C# is better for your requirements.  Neither are niche. Both are cross-platform, multi-purpose, and have broad adoption.   C# does desktop apps. It even does Android. https://www.xamarin.com/platform  I think you're going to have more luck asking people about their new work projects with C# than their legacy work in Java.  And finally, you said games. And for desktop games, Unity with C# is ""the"" way to get into that.  I used Java throughout my college coursework and used C# professionally.#Im a C# developer.  The efforts it takes to make a C# WPF app function and compile and deploy are pretty streamlined.  Everytime we've inherited a Java program and I had to actually open it up and try running it I've never been able to just get the damn thing to run first time.  Had to jump through a bunch of hoops, download and install random stuff, update something, deal with the fact my version was a .1 off from the one the guy who did the work on the project had...  It's been a constant headache.  Really what it comes down to is Visual Studios Nuget Package Manager. It's pretty powerful.  When I run a C# project in VS, Nuget checks all my packages and fetches them on demand and everything installs itself.  I have just found Java IDEs to be cumbersome and awkward and have never found anything that compares to Visual Studio + Resharper.  For Perl, Python, Javascript/Node, etc I use Visual Studio Code to great success due to how lightweight it is.  In my two years of professional work I can safely say I have never had a positive interaction with Java.#C# feels like Java but much cleaner. Plus it's been growing significantly over time. If you can write code in one, you can write in the other. I'd go with C# because of its growing popularity.#I'm still in college. I've worked with both Java and C#, and I find C# to be a lot nicer, easier to use, more intuitive.   Also C# seems to be the more 'modern' language, with a lot of new features being added. #If you know one, the leap to the other is not that difficult.  I'd say C#. Java is a pretty bloated beast if a language and ""lots if info"" doesn't always translate to ""lots of *good* info.""#With ASP.NET Core, C# is going to become more and more prevalent. I think it’s a great language, and was really easy for me to learn, whereas I had trouble with python and ruby. Python and Ruby are great because their syntax is simple, but I was always lost a little because I didn’t know what it was doing behind the scenes, and while C# does this too, I felt like i understood what I was doing more with C# than the other two.  I have no experience with Java, so I can’t make a recommendation other than I enjoyed learning C# and found it easy to work with.#Doesn't matter. Pick one and learn the ins and outs of software development as a general idea.#[deleted]#I think Javas great to learn as it shares a lot with other languages making it easy to pickup new tech.  But I would not want Java to be my main trade#It's not a zero sum game. Pick either. Once you know one you can get going with the other if you like in a couple of weeks.#Okay, I'll break it down. Choose whichever one, it doesn't even matter that much, then learn *programming*, as in loops, ifs, conditionals, the whole mindset, and not just some silly language and syntax. Syntax is easy, it's the problem solving and thinking, the semantics, that's the important part. #I would go the C# route. It's much more easier to use than Java. Just about every Java app I have ever used, was slower than crap. Now if you ever plan to lean towards Android then I'd say learn Java.#I think C# is easier to learn and you can do just as much with is as you can with Java, and arguably you could get your foot in the door at more up and coming promising companies using C# - especially if you want to go the game dev route. #Based on what you want to do with your knowledge I would say learn C#, Java is more for enterprise applications and doesn't have as many options as C# in the game engine space. The languages are similar enough that once you have experience in C# if you did want to move to Java it would not be a difficult process. #I wrote in both pretty heavily from 2005-2008.      I have no idea what they're like now, but I felt that C# was a better-designed language for OOP back then.      Like someone else mentioned, getting Java set up on my computer was a lot simpler *(at least back then)* than making sure .NET was up to date, etc. And there were a lot more libraries and services meant for Java back then, as well.    The *""#""* came from the language design team adding another *""++""* to *""C++""*, and then stacking the second set of two plus-signs on top of the first set, creating an octothorp/pound/number/hashtag sign.      Anyway, having come from C++ before those starting those two languages, I thought that was a nifty little tidbit.      These days, C# seems to have become a de-facto language for indie game programming, and .NET Core seems to be solid for web development.      Java, OTOH, is the de-facto language for native Android development.      So aside from a preference for certain syntax or language features, the type of work you plan on doing is also worth taking into consideration.#I started with learning Java and switched to C#.  I wish I had started with C#.  VS is amazing to work with and I can create apps for any platform, it's easier (for me) to digest.#This is the first time I've ever heard C# is small or tedious.#MS tools (with the exception of vs code) are clunky, slow, and inelegant. C# is no exception. It's a mess just like windows and the only realistic use of it is for game dev. Learn java.#I learned C# in the last year and a half by writing desktop apps where I work.   The thing I miss about the Linux environment is the git CLI (which you can still use, even on windows, just not where I work). Literally the only thing I don't care for in VS 2012 Professional is the version control. It's not great.   That said, the Nuget package manager is legit. It's really really nice to be able to grab things like Spire, PdfSharp, office interop, and on and on. Plus I have been working on an IoT project which means I can load Rpi gateways with windows IoT and use mono to talk directly to sql databases. You get the power and flexibility of embedded devices with direct .NET support. Whut!?!? Testing projects are now available in visual studio community version (at least I know it is for 2017) which is really nice. I highly recommend at least learning test driven development, even if you aren't really strict on it at first.   I don't know what kind of IDE you'd use in Java, but if you're making windows forms applications it's very hard to beat C# + visual studio. You literally drag and drop stuff into the editor, double click on it, and it creates the method for the control. It's very slick.   Happy coding!#C# is far superior. I've worked with both languages for over a decade now as a consultant. #Unless you really want to embrace cross platform C# is better IMHO.  As others have said though, they're similar. I had Java in college and was easily able to pickup C# on my own.#A lot of people have given great advice on Java vs C# so I'd like to help you out with some advice for the future. You said you have no interest in web but keep in mind that is where everything is heading. More and more desktop apps are getting replaced by html5 web apps that people prefer to use because 1) they don't have to install anything and 2) it's pretty easy to make them work on desktop browsers AND phones. Even when it comes to game development, more and more people are just writing them with webGL (except for the big heavy games for now). Now I'm not saying to give up on the idea of learning C# or Java right now. I'm just warning you to prepare yourself for the reality that you may have to become a ""web developer"" in the future if you want to stay relevant as a developer even for the things you want to do. If it means anything, I'm telling you this as a Java developer who enjoys developing in Java#*grabs popcorn*#Is it just me or is C# and Java basically the same language? I've legitimately never seen two languages that were both so big and so similar#IMHO, Java.#Your opinions are leaning towards Java, so pick that and run and stop trying to convince yourself out of it!  Even if it was the wrong choice (it's not), time spent learning it is time better spent than deciding what language to use. Once you are proficient switching shouldn't be an issue.#Don't be a pussy and learn C++.   Java is owned by Oracle and those motherfuckers don't give a shit about anything but milking his customer's tits dry.   Microsoft owns C#, so there is a risk they will become the next Oracle.   If you still want to learn Java or C# do it for the money.   #Python.#Python#Python"
Python;876msl;1522040843.0;/r/Python/comments/876msl/sanic_python_web_server_thats_written_to_die_fast/;Sanic: python web server that's written to die fast;"Performance of Sanic-based web servers is pretty good, sure.The only problem is that people want not only fast but stable servers.From this perspective the Sanic is awful.Malicious software can crash any Sanic server easy by out-of-memory error.Let me analyze several different attack vectors:1. Send a POST to any (even not existing) PATH.   Push ""Content-Length"" HTTP header with the maximum available value   without sending a body.   You should discover what is a maximum allowed size for POST HTTP   body.  Sanic by default limiting it down to insane 100 megabytes   but Reverse Proxy Server like NGINX may reduce it to more   reasonable 1 MB for example. Even 1 MB is enough.   Now we have 2 options:    a. Without closing the connection open as many concurrent      connections as you can and push all of them into the state when      HTTP headers are sent but HTTP body transition is postponed.      Pretty classic attack for locking all TCP ports on a server by      opened idle connections.      Sanic will drop the connection after 60 seconds by default but       a minute may be enough for pushing the server into Deny-Of-Service      state. The problem is not specific to Sanic, consequences are      relative innocent.   b. The more interesting case is sending *almost whole BODY* but without      a couple bytes at the end.      In fact, Sanic performs a routing and request handling only after      fetching the whole BODY.      It means that BODY is COLLECTED IN MEMORY before starting of      PATH/HEADERS analyzing and processing.  You can declare 100 MB      request's BODY, send 99 MB of garbage random data and stop      sending after that.      Open another concurrent request and do the same. Repeat multiple      times. Most likely the server will run out of memory *before*      getting run out of free ports.      Why out-of-memory error is more harmful than free-ports      problem?  Because of it, not only web process(es) stops      processing incoming requests but the whole server goes to      unresponsible state: physical memory is out, everything becomes      swapped to disk, CPU is overheated by kernel swapper worker, as      the result even connecting to a problematic server by SSH becomes      deadly slow.      The problem can be reduced by adding monitoring tools for      looking at Sanic processes memory and killing problematic web      workers. But default configuration has no such monitors.      I bet that most web servers in the world are not configured      properly (at least very many of them).  Also killing a web      process is a painful procedure, sometimes is not easy to      distinguish normal occasional high memory consumption from      malicious attack. As result, normal processing of user data will      be killed.2. Use Sanic streaming.   Sanic has Response Streaming feature.  It is widely used to   download big data, video streaming etc.   Assume you know that https://server.com/video is a resource name   for video stream powered by Sanic.   How to screw it up?  Really very easy.   Connect to the server by regular GET https://server.com/video and   read body SLOWLY.   Sanic has no Flow Control for streaming data (in fact it has no   flow control at all).  Data is sent to a peer when the next data chunk   is available.  If TCP socket's Write Buffer is overloaded -- the   data is pushed into process memory.  If HTTP peer (browser or   another client) consumes stream slower than Sanic produces it --   Sanic process will end up with out-of-memory eventually.   The problem is very dramatic because it doesn't need a malicious   software to reproduce -- just slow network connection between   client and server is enough to explode the bomb.   As result, a streaming in Sanic is broken by design, the feature   usage is very dangerous even if nobody wants to knock out your   server -- it will be demolished by an innocent client with slow   network.What to do?Unfortunately, problems described above are architectural problems ofSanic framework, they cannot be solved on the user side.Moreover, fixing is not possible without changing Sanic public API.Good news: Sanic development team runs so fast that new backwardincompatible changes can land into master without any deprecationperiod and related procedures. They did it several times, the project isstill in beta stage.The only real protection can be done Right Now is *limiting a memoryacquired by Sanic process*. Better to kill an eager process than allowit to grab all memory with dying not only the Sanic process but the wholeserver.Graceful restart could be very complicated but even rough""kill -9"" is better than nothing.A careful review of configuration parameters for both Sanic and ReverseProxy (like NGINX) is also very important.";"This is exactly the kind of post I've been missing from r/python in the last year or so.   Thanks for taking the time out to write it and thanks for posting! #Who learned something new? I certainly did, thanks :)  Bonus: ""Sanic development teams runs so fast""  I'm thinking... perhaps you could provide some nginx configuration that could mitigate some of these problems?#As much as I appreciate this post, I feel like you should probably add a disclosure that you maintain a competing async web framework.  At the heart of this, isn't this just a case of slow loris? Now, given sanic shouldn't need the body to perform routing unless it's attempting to do multiple dispatch  based on content of the body (which is silly, don't do that). #Very interesting, thank you! I haven't ever made what could be called a ""production app"", fortunately, but I do mess around with sanic a lot and it's nice to see what's wrong with it. Might you consider bringing these points up to the sanic team directly?#> Good news: Sanic development team runs so fast that new backward incompatible changes can land into master without any deprecation period and related procedures.   The sarcasm. I can sense it#That’s why I would always use aiohttp as an async web framework. Might lose some of the nice features included in Sanic, but it appears to be much more reliable.#Sanic maintainer here.  >Good news: Sanic development team runs so fast that new backward incompatible changes can land into master without any deprecation period and related procedures. They did it several times, the project is still in beta stage.  We encourage people to pin releases to improve reliability. We see master as a development branch. Not sure how you're facilitating this on aiohttp, but nobody told people to use the master branch for a reliable release in the sanic repo.  Regarding  >The problem can be reduced by adding monitoring tools for looking at Sanic processes memory and killing problematic web workers. But default configuration has no such monitors.  That can be reduced by configuring the request body memory limit. See the following for an example: https://github.com/channelcat/sanic/blob/06d46d56cd4e20850019f0b096c1e26e145f853a/tests/test_payload_too_large.py#L8  In general, I would discourage using monitoring/alerting here, and encourage people to use multiple memory limited sanic processes (hint cgroups) rather than monitoring/alerting around this issue. Think 12 factor app, [section 6](https://12factor.net/processes) -- it should be stateless and able to be replaced.  Furthermore, a sane solution to mitigate this in the real world would suggest IP address throttling, at least to discourage DOS and force DDOS.  In conclusion, it seems that you could have opened some of these issues with the sanic project, rather than write a reddit post first. In particular the memory limit seems more like a question than a problem, since that is configurable. Are you trying to inherently promote your own project as an alternative? Feel free to join the discussion here, if you're actually interested in sanic: https://github.com/channelcat/sanic/issues/1176#Issue #2 is completely unfounded.  Sanic uses the TCP transport provided by the `uvloop` library.  Sanic does not implement any flow control, because flow control is handled internally by uvloop.  >Data is sent to a peer when the next data chunk is available. If TCP socket's Write Buffer is overloaded -- the data is pushed into process memory. If HTTP peer (browser or another client) consumes stream slower than Sanic produces it -- Sanic process will end up with out-of-memory eventually.  This is false. Uvloop maintains a 65kb flow-control send buffer. If the buffer hits this limit, the tcp `write()` command _blocks_ the calling thread until the buffer is successfully sent. In this case, it is not possible for sanic to continue to produce streaming data if the client is consuming it slower than sanic is producing it. It will keep hitting the 65kb buffer limit and waiting for the client to catch up.  Issues 1.a and 1.b can be mitigated by changing some default config values.  By default `REQUEST_MAX_SIZE = 100000000 #100 megabytes` but it could be changed to `REQUEST_MAX_SIZE = 1000000 #1 megabyte` by the developer implementing sanic in their application. The 60 second timeout for delayed requests can be changed by configuring the `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` variable. By default `REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 60` but it can easily be changed to `REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 5` if the developer wishes.#How does this work with typical Flask or Django with Gunicorn on Nginx?#The main performance bottlenecks of a web app are almost always the network and database access. Improving back end performance by 0.1ms per request makes no sense when 70ms are spent accessing the database and when it takes 800ms to deliver a response.

My framework doesnt support streaming, so mostly I am curious about number 1. How would one prevent 1a from happening? From 1b point of view, I see that aiohttp has a 'client_max_size' setting, which prevents the 100MB body from happening, but you can take a .99MB request, and do the same thing, just with more connections. Same attack, just smaller body, more connections. How does one actually prevent 1b? The body is going to end up in memory regardless, right?  How can I mitigate against these things? Do you have any suggestions?#I think these are pretty much intrinsic problems with async IO. You can probably mostly mitigate this with a load balancer to designed to deal with slow clients, but in general async is another name for cooperative multitasking and cooperative multitasking today has the same problems it did in the 90s: one badly written piece of code can block the thread and kill the system by mistake.#This is amazing just because of Sanic #And now ""Sanic security"" is touting itself as production ready despite the author [apparently lacking a basic understanding of security](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/qc1rh0/comment/hhe5cdc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I say write simple tests for simple features and move on. Save the effort for mission critical features. I’ve seen entire days wasted on tests for trivial things. Depending on your traction you need to keep moving. People obsess over total coverage of every piece of code.  I think that’s detrimental at startups. #Also... infrastructure. You don't need configuration management, server maintenance, complicated deploy mechanisms, and a custom databases to serve millions of requests a day. Just get on heroku.  When traffic increases, slide a couple bars to the right. ""Heroku is too expensive"" is a much better problem to have than ""we wasted 30% of our dev time on infra.""#While I don't disagree in general, I have purposefully done the opposite of item 1 in my new business and immediately after the MVP phase started to build out a microservices infrastructure.  Three (counter?) points to make on that front:  1) Yes, microservices from ground zero sucks.  It sucks a lot.  Security is complex.  Deployment, central configuration, and health-monitoring is complex.  My tech stack is - to me at least - ludicrous in the number of components I'm counting on and the effort to make them play nice together.  I've spent 6 weeks doing nothing profitable just trying to understand all the pieces and implement them to a reasonable level of functionality.  2) For many startups that I see (I have an app/platform idea!) microservices are indeed overkill.  The view ain't worth the climb and the learning curve(s) associated are like tying big weights to your ankles before jumping in the pool.  The reality is that microservices architecture is - as of today - only justifiable if there is either huge traffic (which almost no startup has out of the gate) or huge complexity on the immediate horizon (like, during and right after MVP).  In the grand scheme of software/tech startups, most ideas are relatively simple so they do not meet either of the criteria.  3) In my case, it may take years for the transaction volume alone to justify microservices, but the complexity and disparity of needs is a challenge right out of the gate, and it is only going to get more complex as time goes on.  Having built out these types of applications twice in the past (essentially a MES system with lots of automation) I have seen them very quickly become mired in their own monolithic or even SOA soup.  So, I decided to bite the bullet, take the pain up front so that we never get stuck or have our agility reduced by the complexity of integrating new needs / features / modules into our system.  I feel like the hype of microservice architecture has created a counter-movement of nay-sayers who know they can accomplish most tasks the other way.  However, I also see LOTS of new tooling being built to support building things that way.  So, I'd encourage anyone considering choosing the microservices path to think long and hard about their investment, but don't write it off just because it's hard.#I went in on a small startupish project for a friend and they were adamant from the business side that every page of the site needed its own microservice.

I'm wondering if you guys can refute this.>FYI, OP: I work in 'Big Data' and you are vaaaaaastly overestimating the ability of Big Data to handle this problem. We aren't even within several orders of magnitude of being able to handle the calculation problem. This is not something that is rationally up for debate among reasonable people, it's just true.>Think about bread. Bread is basic and simple and should be really, really easy. How much bread do you make? Should be a simple task.>So how often do you post on facebook about bread? How often does anyone you know ever post on the internet or social media of any kind about bread? Basically never. We're flying blind. Ok, no problem. There are other ways to estimate beyond social media inputs! But what kind of bread... should we be making white or wheat bread? How thick should the slices be? Whole grain? Rye? How should it be baked? what about unleavened bread for the religious? Baguettes? Rolls? Potato Bread? Naan style bread? Pitas? How exactly do we calculate how much to produce of all these different things? There are hundreds of kinds of bread in that wikipedia list, and tens of thousands of types is probably more accurate when you look at all the sub varieties. How do you calculate all of that? How do you calculate the changes in taste as certain types of bread rise and fall in popularity? New preference observations need to be found every single week at minimum, and probably more often than that. Nobody's posting about it on social media certainly. Sales data takes far too long to aggregate and is far too incomplete to make meaningful decisions, from personal experience in the consumer data aggregation industry.>Furthermore, how do you decide which bread goes where? Which cities are bread-lovers and bread-haters? Which types of bread belong in which ratios in which cities? How is that broken down by neighborhood? Even furthermore, how do you price all of this? How can you possibly organize the logistics of it all from a central planning computer? How do you organize innovation? How do you make decisions about who should be producing it and where production should be located? How do you shift production among the thousands of types of bread when certain inputs have supply shocks (this year has a great rye and barley harvest, but a poor wheat harvest)?>This is literally impossible, and as I said above we aren't even within several orders of magnitude of being able to calculate 'bread'. Much less the entire economy of goods and services. We know how communist societies on a large scale actually deal with this - they have basically one kind of bread, and it's the same everywhere, and it's crappy quality, and there are frequent shortages/surpluses anyways because even something that simple is hard to calculate. And eventually they just change to a market-based approach, because markets are wonderful magic that do all this for us.;">I work in 'Big Data' and you are vaaaaaastly overestimating the ability of Big Data to handle this problem. We aren't even within several orders of magnitude of being able to handle the calculation problem.   I have worked in Big Data, and this guy is full of shit, because he still doesn't understand the ECP. The ECP doesn't say ""computers can't simulate markets."" No fucking shit they can't. That's not the point.  Mises originally formulated the ECP to argue that the only ""rational"" logic for an economy is a market based one, whereas socialist planners would have to fabricate stuff from scratch. **The ECP has literally nothing to do with whether the economy meets people's needs or wants**, given that, as we know, the market does a piss poor job of that anyways.  With computational power, however, socialist planners can absolutely devise a rational non-market system for allocating production and goods.#He is absolutely correct that ""big data"" and ""AI"" are all too frequently trotted out as some magical panacea.  However, he's completely overlooking one simple but important question: why can't consumers just *tell* the planner how much and which kinds of bread they demand?#We shouldn't speculate about the runtime of hypothetical algorithms, reality always ends up producing a different result. In this case, the best we can do is give an upper bound for a solution *at least as good* as the existing market-based solution. Currently, we are running a decentralized algorithm wherein actors independently negotiate exchange with one another. Available to this algorithm is the computing power present within the brain of every single person participating in the economy -- although as nobody is thinking about exchange *all the time*, only a fraction of this power is used.   Let every brain add a constant (astronomical) number of resources *B*, and let the number of humans be *n*. To perfectly simulate the market, we therefore need *O(nB)* resources. It is trivial to see that a simulation of the market can perform at least as well as the market itself, when given similar computational resources -- just perform the exact same computations. This is, in fact, the [Lange-Lerner-model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lange_model). Whether or not this model can perform *better* than the market depends on the ability of the planners to use lookahead in constant time -- if the ""next steps"" can be predicted with greater-than-chance confidence, improved outcomes can be achieved such as e.g. the elimination of X-inefficiency. Nevertheless, regardless of the ability to perform lookahead, this solution will be *at least as good* as the market.  Thus, a computational solution superior to the market will be available *if* (but not *only if* -- this inference we cannot make):  1. We have access to mass-production of a machine with computational power equal to or greater than *B*, the amount of resources the average brain spends thinking about market exchanges. 2. We have the capacity to produce and available energy to run one of these machines for every human being in existence.  In other words, if we can give every single person on the planet a personal computer, we are only a couple of iterations of Moore's Law ahead. If we cannot use massive parallelism for scale in this way, we must wait for further breakthroughs in software (and trust me, plenty of computer scientists are working on related subjects).  > This is literally impossible  Conjecture, and not even all that reasonable conjecture -- Amazon is getting fairly close to a centralized system to stocking goods for 24-hour delivery, which makes it at least *reasonable* to think that software solution with runtime independent of *n* exists, even if we haven't invented it yet.#Before I accept that computers cannot solve the economic calculation problem, you're going to have to explain why the economic calculation problem is a problem.  What is it that I'm supposed to have difficulty calculating here?#Is everyone ignoring the Chilean experimentation with computation and AI in the 70s, and how it actually saved the transfer of goods to the places that needed them when a strike took out most of the distribution trucks? No?  Cybersyn is a thing. And that was in the 70s.#The economic calculation problem isn't about having enough computational power to rise to some arbitrary level of efficient planning--it's about *always having less power by definition* than the market.#Does the capitalist free market really know better? I've worked at a supermarket, I've seen the bread that is wasted off unsold and also the days when bread is in such short supply that whining customers accused me of hoarding it for myself.  What do you think a market is? Magic? I swear, you people talk of the market as though it was God. A thing that sees all and knows all. Let me tell you the story of Cybersyn: a national computer network set up in Allende's socialist Chile to enable building a society of 'Red Plenty' where everyone could live a life of great standards.  One day, the entire logistics network of Chile was shut down by a strike backed by American interests. 40,000 drivers were not working. 3000 replacement workers were assigned to the appropriate duties by Cybersyn and it kept Chile functioning close to normally. This is what 1970s computer technology could do: better than the anarchic mess of the market.  How can that be applied to production tasks? Well, two Scottish Marxists, Cottril and Cockshott, wrote a book on this: ""Towards a New Socialism."" It outlines how a typical desktop computer of 1990 could plan an entire economy of a million inputs and outputs. Since 1990, computing power has increased dramatically. We won't have any problems relying on modern computers to plan an economy.#Thought #1:  I am contemplating a Master's Degree, basically in ""Big Data"".  The process has had me reading material about what techniques like artificial intelligence and machine learning are being used for.  *I'm not going to refute this.  I'm going to agree with this.  The writer is dead-on, in the view from my desk.*  Thought #2.  The problem with the 'Economic Calculation Problem' is how the errors impact society.  In a closed society, they are over-simplified.  Which means that the production of a society never actually gets the opportunity to get feedback on a limitless number of potential changes, new features, or creative permutations of a products.  If all you are doing is relying on The Machine, then you won't even have a choice of Creamy v. Crunchy, and your society will never even get close to considering Almond Butter, 'peanuts and salt only', or Nutella.  Thought #3.  The other problem is that errors are *borne* by society.  One of those ways is lack of product diversity, from #2.  But if a product is predicted, but doesn't end up really working well, then the loss is borne by society.  The resources that built that factory that produced 'the bad thing' actually took away from resources which could have been used for other things.  In a private property and free market system, losses don't 'bleed out' to the rest of society, they are basically self-contained to the owners.  #>no one but me understands the ECP - and here is the gospel definition in a pedantic little box.  u/specterofsandersism   /thread  For the rest of us, we should ignore this dolt.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTTyzl6taKk#I have a professional certificate in data mining and I can tell you this guy doesn't do a good job of classifications error if he thinks these questions:  >How thick should the slices be?  are ""good questions"". This problem was solved long ago:  >Until yesterday (2008), all bread that went on sale – from a sliced white loaf, to a baguette, ciabatta or bloomer – had to weigh 400g or multiples thereof, unless it was a small bun or ""morning pastry"", as the legislation phrases it  >How exactly do we calculate how much to produce of all these different things?  lbs of grain available, lbs of firewood, and oven cooking surface area.  >How do you calculate the changes in taste as certain types of bread rise and fall in popularity?   You don't. Print out 4 recipes at the bakery and allow ""trendsetters"" to make their own bread in their own oven. Time taken: 4 minutes tops.  >New preference observations need to be found every single week at minimum, and probably more often than that  Misguided horseshit.  >How can you possibly organize the logistics of it all from a central planning computer?  Take the shipping addresses from existing bakeries as a starting point. Update new data based on complaints and approvals. Get off your fat ass and ride a bicycle.   > How do you make decisions about who should be producing it and where production should be located?   The ones with the ovens and breadmaking machines should be the starting point. From there, look for a fireplace for additional ""resources""  >How do you shift production among the thousands of types of bread when certain inputs have supply shocks (this year has a great rye and barley harvest, but a poor wheat harvest)?  Multi-grain bread.  >This is literally impossible,  He's literally a dumbfuck who can't use common sense for production factors.  >We know how communist societies on a large scale actually deal with this - they have basically one kind of bread,  Yep, a dumbfuck alright. Tito's Incentivized BreadLands were the same as Mao's Capitalist rice fields.  >because markets are wonderful magic that do all this for us.  Magic indeed. Magic as in ""not real life"".  #Hayek's knowledge problem ***is not the same*** as Mises' economic calculation problem, no computer or amount of computer processing power would ever be capable of solving the ECP, as there would be a specific type of information missing without the market system. The socialist planners could never rationally determine what to produce, where, when, at which quantity, with which inputs, without market prices, because they wouldn't know the costs of producing all this stuff.  Here's the most relevant parts of an [article by economist Robert Murphy](https://mises.org/wire/socialism-calculation-problem-not-knowledge-problem-0) about the subject:     >Even so, all of the problems of dispersed knowledge, tacit knowledge, and how prices are an efficient mechanism for communication of information—none of that is the fundamental flaw Mises attributed to socialism. From the beginning, when Mises would walk through his critique, he would stipulate at the outset that the central planner in a socialist regime had not only good intentions, but also all of the relevant technical knowledge at his disposal. Now to be sure, in the real world these problems do exist: A socialist dictator might be ruthless with his opponents, and (as Hayek stressed) he couldn’t possibly get all of the “facts on the ground” from experts around the country, jammed into his mind in order to make good decisions.  >Yet even though these problems are enormous in the real world, nonetheless, for the sake of argument, Mises assumed away the problem of evil and the problem of dispersed knowledge. Yet it would still be the case, Mises claimed, that the socialist planner would be groping in the dark. Even after the fact, the planner would have no way of assessing whether the scarce resources—natural resources, capital goods, and labor—at his disposal were being deployed in the best manner. The socialist planner would have no way of measuring the economic efficiency of his plan for the of society’s resources.  >Mises didn’t argue that the socialist planners wouldn’t be able to process information in real-time. No, Mises kept stressing that there would be a categorical absence of a special type of information (if we want to use that word) that could only be produced amidst market institutions.  >Indeed, in Notes and Recollections Mises refers to these economists pushing the mathematical solution and writes, “They failed to see the very first challenge: How can economic action that always consists of preferring and setting aside, that is, of making unequal valuations, be transformed into equal valuations, and the use of equations?”  >Mises not only identifies the crucial flaw with socialism, but he also explains how a market economy solves the problem. Specifically, the institution of private property and the use of a common medium of exchange, allow for the generation of genuine market prices for all of the goods and services available. Entrepreneurs are then able to engage in monetary calculation, to embark on projects that they think will be profitable and avoid those that will suffer losses. This market process is what allows a capitalist system to efficiently allocate resources, whereas a socialist system cannot—not even “in principle.”  >Let me try to motivate the point this way: When we use a thermometer to measure the temperature inside an oven in a commercial bakery, the device transmits information to us. There really is an objective “fact of the matter” of the kinetic energy of the air molecules bouncing around inside the oven, and the thermometer is an imperfect way of translating that data to us, in a form our minds can comprehend and incorporate into our decisions. But there’s no doubt that the oven really has a temperature, regardless of our measuring it with a thermometer.  >In contrast, when we ask, “How much economic value does the oven possess?” then that is a fundamentally different question. This isn’t an objective fact that is embedded in the arrangement of matter. The question takes into account all of the subjective preferences of everyone on the planet, as well as their expectations about the possibility of transforming matter into different forms. It is a mind-boggling question, in fact, that can only be answered by setting up a market economy and then making informed guesses as to what people would be willing to pay for the oven. "

We do. Its all the time.  >Or at least by whom?  We do. Its by the companies who's services we use and who we've granted permission to gather said data in exchange to use those services for free.   What protections are you envisioning? A ban on data mining? Inability to sell said data? #Europe has GDPR coming around on May 25th which I'm personally a fan of. It's shocking the amount of information that companies can gather on an individual based simply on their interactions with a website, and not all of them entirely conscious. Simply 'liking' a certain friends posts more than others can be enough to start to deduce your own views  Without giving consumers some idea and control over the data gathered on them, stuff like CA's precision targeting is just going to be much more commonplace  EDIT: A bit more extreme example, but I imagine this kind of targeting could be used for more malicious ends such as fringe organizations finding people who would be more susceptible to radicalization and reaching out to them to try and pull them over. #So looking at the fact that your question specifically mentions private companies, and everyone is responding in regards to private companies, might I ask if we are supposed to consider this question as a *consumer protection* bill or rights, or as a legitimate *bill of legal rights* that protects citizens from the government?  Because while I can maybe imagine such a thing working (or at least helping) in terms of private companies, what you're talking about completely elides the NSA and whatever other government agencies are collecting data and spying on us.  #The right to be forgotten i.e. all traces of you deleted on platforms that are to be regulated by the Federal Government, much like the EU(European Union). I think it's a bit ridiculous though to require xyz person to provide a full list of URL's of which they want to be erased. Most people don't have the technical expertise to figure out where every bit of their information may be kept, for instance way back machine on the w3c's website makes copies of literally every website in existence.#The Economist had a long write-up about this very topic in an issue a few months ago.  The salient point for me was the contention that there is a huge economy of scale to big data collection.  Facebook and Google are getting better and better at it, which means newer firms are going to struggle to enter the marketplace.  Longer term, this could lead to virtual monopolies in tech.  Worse than how it already is.    One proposed solution was to change how data is treated.  Instead of making it proprietary to each individual company, open it up like a utility.  For example, Facebook would have to sell access to its data to new firms.    As users, our relationship to tech firms and how we provide data will also have to change.  Ownership of the data should be switched from the tech companies to us as individuals.  These data have serious financial benefit, not to mention the privacy consequences, and they're being sold and used without clear notifications.   I don't pretend to know what the answer is.  Maybe put personal data on a blockchain?  Private keys would allow consumers to provide data to tech firms and would allow consumers to shut off the tap when necessary.  Can you imagine what happens when people lose their private keys, though?  Full nightmare.  #In the late 80's and early 90's when the WWW barely existed but the internet was a useful tool I recommended to new users of each, that they consider anything they post (email or otherwise) as equivalent to standing in your front yard talking loudly to you neighbor across the street.  IOW, you are in public and don't forget it.  In my estimation the same holds today.  There's just a lot of slick marketing to obfuscate that reality.  If you aren't on a VPN or other secure private connection you are in in public.  Don't expect the people who hand you a blow horn to protect your privacy.#I used to be in favor, but now I think getting the necessary consensus to enact such a bill would be a fool's errand.  Right now public outrage is directed at Facebook for not screening partners with the proper amount of scrutiny, calling them irresponsible for allowing its users to be shown fake news.  Months ago the outrage was on Facebook for curating what the users were considering popular.    There's an impasse there that doesn't really have a comfortable resolution.  We either end up trusting whatever entity to be the arbiter of what's correct/just, or trust the users allowing bad actors to intervene.  We're not really in the nascent stages of this industry, it's been around for a while now.  As per your questions of who is collecting your data, most of the time that's not something Facebook can just pull up for you because marketing can be done through them.  I suppose you could pass a law requiring Facebook to tell you if they've outright given your data to a third party... but then what?#No, but I would like to see software source code and network communications given full first amendment protections - I would like that clause to be written into the Constitution.  It won't happen, because governments are fully aware of what the implications of that are.#I suspect everyone's answer is going to be some variation of ""protect privacy"" (which I totally agree with), so I'll give a totally different answer.  I want to see some kind of digital ID system that can (optionally of course) be used to identify your real self on public forums. So like twitter's ""verified account"" thing, but government-backed so that it can tie into any and all accounts. I think this will go a long way toward countering russian trolls and bots, not to mention corporate astroturfing and old fashioned shock trolling.  We can make it completely optional to use, but specific communities could mandate it in order to keep discussion high-quality.

Is this too much to ask for?

There should be a hiring guide for companies (especially startups without a CDO yet) looking for Data Scientists  )";"A few observations:  If you want your Senior Data Scientist to stick around, make sure you can honestly answer the question of how much of his or her time will be spent collecting and cleaning data and how much on analysis. There's always some of both but if you're trying to recruit a scalpel for chopping potatoes you're both going to get frustrated.  The most effective and actionable insights from data science typically come from looking inward at how the business itself reacts to a changing business environment. Research shops sometimes have difficulty doing this. Think very carefully about how your Senior Data Scientist will work with your other teams.   If you expect him or her to handle change management and soft skills make sure that's clear up front because that's not usually part of a PhD program. If you don't expect this individual to manage this, make sure you can tell candidates what kind of plan or support you have for this.  When I go to a Data Science job interview the one question I tend to ask of the management is ""What will you do when I produce a report that shows the business is wrong about something you are very confident in?""  Make sure you can answer this question honestly and in a way that shows you are prepared to exercise evidence-based decision making.#As someone with a PhD, and many years of experience in academia, industry (including finance) and consulting for both plus government, I would not apply for this job. Turn offs include:  > ""think outside the box""  Don't put that unless your listing thought outside the box too. It's the most generic expression for ""we want creative people but we're not creative and don't know what creativity is""  > ""You will be assisting our Data Science Intern in the projects that he is assigned""  Assisting the intern sounds like *assistant to the intern*, if you want a leader, don't phrase things in a way that they are underneath those at the bottom of the ladder. Rephrase that to say ""lead a team"" or ""mentor""  > Does this excite you? I hope it does  I have no interest in the personal hopes of the HR person or other company employee who wrote this.

That's been exceedingly rare lately.

You may be better suited to look for a Financial Engineer (Data Scientist in the finance world) as the more typical DS candidates will not usually possess the finance knowledge you desire. Good luck. #I think the title/requirements don't fully align with the job description and what you want to achieve.   It sounds like you have some data assets and want to to leverage them but aren't entirely sure what should be done. In that regard, you are looking for a person who can decide what should be done as much as actually be able to do it.  If the above is correct, consider hiring as much for personality as for skills. It sounds like you are looking for someone who is comfortable with ambiguity and can manage iterative bets until he stumbles on something good. This is something that (I think) Ph.Ds should be comfortable with, but you can find those traits in other places as well. Notably, what I think you are looking for at this point aren't so much the quantitative skills that a traditional Ph.D. data scientist has.   You mentioned someone straight out of bootcamp who was very enthusiastic. I'd consider him/her. It sounds like a good chance at personality match for the job, and while they will be capped with respect to the ""scientific sophistication"" they bring to the table, it's not at all clear that that is what you need.   Said differently, data science is not magic, and you can't bring in a data science and expect profit to appear in a place no one was looking. You're looking for someone to whom you can say ""here is a bunch of data go find treasure"" whereas you're currently for hiring for someone in the ""The treasure is here. Go extract it"" spirit. #hire anyone who has a titanic kernel on kaggle#Depending on where you are located, I expect that salary range might be a challenge. An experienced candidate with the experience you seek is probably already at the top of your range.#If you have the budget for it, you can hire consultants to help you find the right candidate. At an old company, we tried finding a data scientist ourselves with no idea what we were doing and had an awful experience. We finally hired a consultant to help and found an excellent employee.#I don't know if you're guilty of this or not, but I'll post in case I can help guide your reasoning. I'm between jobs as a data scientist, and in looking for jobs I have come across a number of job postings seeking a ""data scientist"" but with domain-specific experience.   Data science requires a solid mathematics/statistics and programming background. To have expertise in all the businesses that can now utilize data science is somewhat ridiculous, assuming you want someone who really is well-versed in the math/programming the role requires. On the other hand, if you want someone with a finance degree who can maybe code and can handle financial math (but perhaps not linear algebra, signal processing, or other fields in applied math/statistics), you're gonna have a bad time when the neural net they've cobbled together from a library is overfitted or having numerical issues. Basically, if you hire a STEM grad, your data scientist is the black box, and you can train them on enough finance to get by. If you hire a finance wonk, their tools might become the black box, and nobody will ever know when those tools aren't doing what there supposed to, much less fix it.  Fact is, most models will return all kinds of crazy results from time to time, flukes in the data or how it was presented to the machine, because the machine generally doesn't know the basics of finance, it's trained to find patterns in the data. Your data scientist needs to know enough to see when the machine is missing basics of finance, and when the machine itself is broken. In my opinion, it's easier to get worthy insights from a machine that is definitely working than trusting one that might be broken.  Also, there's something to be said about confirmation bias in terms of experience. If you have someone who's well-versed in the dogma of finance, they may (consciously or not) filter out results that are real-world disruptive, but also contradict longstanding practices and widely held beliefs. You want disruptive, talk to someone who has no idea. Teach them the absolutes (lending money at a negative interest rate is ludicrous) and the basics, but beyond that, let them find what they find.   But this is just my opinion, and as one of those STEM guys, I probably am biased. I've worked places where they'd happily futz with the data until it backed their preconceived notions (the phrase ""decision support"" came up a lot), I'd rather not see these practices in yet more fields. But it's your call.#[deleted]#""You will lay out the groundwork for creating metrics and valuation models for cryptoassets for the inevitable time when the crypto market is no longer a speculative market.""  It's always going to be a speculative market. These 'coins' don't produce anything like bonds or stocks do. They just sit there doing fuck all like gold. There's nothing to value.   You don't need a data scientist. You need someone who questions things and isn't afraid to challenge the foundation of what you're trying to do. #We've received over 100 applicants in the past week, but almost all of them seem to be Data Scientists that are sending out resumes everywhere and anywhere without even looking at the job description, which makes it even harder for us.

I think the job responsibilities are pretty clear, except maybe some language on how much data engineering is going to be needed - I've found that sometimes data scientists can be prima donnas about doing their own data engineering.  2 + 3. If you interview PhD candidates make sure you ask them why they're choosing this instead of a job in academia. There should be no assumptions that working in industry is easier than academia - in fact, it can often be harder because you're dealing with real people, unfortunately.   That being said, there's a rich history of PhD ""quants"" in the finance world so I think you will attract many of those. I think it'll be either quants or actuaries that you would want to find - they come the closest to describing what you need.  4. These days, for a senior i would start the bidding at 3 yrs of actual experience as a data scientist - not including data analyst type roles, bootcamps, or internships, unless they have direct relevant experience in finance at a well known institution. Then you can give them some leeway, but make sure they know fundamentals of crypto currency."
nosleep;872jpg;1522001900.0;/r/nosleep/comments/872jpg/im_having_a_problem_with_google_photos/;I'm having a problem with Google Photos;"It's been a fairly rough time, but you know I thought I was getting a handle on it, but this is wrecking my head (apologising for the colloquialism). It's been a couple of months now since my wife Laura passed away. Myself and our daughter have been working through our grief and it hasn't been easy, but you know having photos of the three of us has been a help. I've always been the techie one in the family and before the accident I got Laura to setup automatic sharing between us. It's a relatively new feature in Google that does face recognition and automatically shares photos of select people with a partner, me in this case. So I have a copy of all her photos of me, our daughter and family in my online album. It's been a godsend for us. I even have an album of the best ones sharing on our Chromecast at home.Also, being the techie, I went through the painful process of closing Laura's social media accounts and posting final updates. I think it was part of my coping mechanism early on, to focus on practical things that were within my ability. It held back the darkness you know. My wife's Google account is closed. I didn't want to be getting a reminder in a years time from some automated algorithm like Facebook saying ""You haven't heard from Laura in a while."" That's creepy and my daughter is now at the age where she's starting to use social media. It's something I just don't want to have to deal with.So life moves on. Daughter is back in school. I'm back to work. We're trying to go on with things. It's not easy, but you have no choice. And then a few weeks back I got a notification saying new photos had been shared. Freaking odd. I checked them out. It's a couple of real old photos of us before we were married. I assumed it was just a glitch in the data, the algorithms picking up archived stuff. I smiled when I saw them (and cried in my bed thinking about them that night). But you just swallow those feelings down and and move on.And then a week or two later, another notification. This is where it gets freaky. It was just a single photo, of me, asleep in bed. I was a little taken back by it. I checked the settings and I couldn't access Laura's account any more. It's locked out and unusable. But there is that photo. When I got home I checked her mobile phone. (Yea I kept it, I'm a bit of a technology hoarder). It was powered off and had no charge. The account was a bill account, so it was gone as well. So yea, I had to put it down to another glitch in the algorithms. Big data is always a little creepy right? I reason out that it must be an old photo. My wife was a bit of insomniac. I'd be falling asleep at 10pm in the evening, but she wouldn't be able to go to bed until 1am. So one night she must have taken the photo before she went to bed and the algorithm is only now working out my face from the photo. The photo is quite dark, so maybe some new filter has been added to the algorithm and it managed to pick out my face.But that's not all. I got another notification this very morning. This time it's a photo of our daughter sleeping in her bed. Must be the same reason right? The algorithm got better and picked out the faces. But it still creeped me out, like Laura was sending me photos from beyond the grave. So I checked the settings again, checked her account, still can't get in as it's now disabled. Checked her phone. Still off. I then got curious and I downloaded the photos and started checking the metadata, they are both timestamped the night before the accident. What the fuck? I've submitted feedback, I've emailed google about it, hoping they'll just turn it off but I've gotten no response, as you'd expect, it’s googIe. I haven't mentioned it to our daughter. Really not worth making her feel upset about it. Still I feel as if something is off. I don’t believe my own logic about updates to the algorithm either. Why would my wife take these photos the night before. It’s probably nothing, just coincidence right?";That's creepy. It could be someone messing with you.  Keep like a written account of everytime it happens too, see if there is a pattern or something.  Are her accounts deleted or deactivated? (Not tech savvy, but someone might have hacked into her accounts if they are just deactivated.)  Could your daughter have tried messing around with your wife's accounts? Anyway good luck and stay safe my dude.#As long as they’re time stamped before she passed, then I’d agree it’s just a google glitch that they’ll never respond to you about.  But if some start having a time stamp after she was gone, then you better start worrying.  Just be happy you have the pictures  she must have loved you both very much.#I wonder if it has anything to do with machine learning. You know like dark photos were fed into a machine and trained to pick up faces and now they're creating their own images with the faces in your albums?

We need immediate action because we live in a society in which people are so desensitized that if no immediate action is taken, something else will plug into people's minds and privacy will be a complete after thought. Our society is so desensitized, when Columbine happened in 1999, that was all the nation could talk about and we came together as a nation. In the present we have disasters like this on what seems like a monthly basis and we have grown to the point where it just normal to expect.But we can't let go of privacy as another domino in society, it's something where we are finally starting to have the weapons to fight back, with like Brave and DuckDuckGo.We need to stand up for our privacy from the big data harvesting companies like Facebook and Google.

Michael Flynn, speaking then as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said that such open-source data initiatives, and in particular the study of social media such as Facebook, had entirely transformed intelligence-gathering. He reported that traditional signals intelligence and human intelligence were increasingly being replaced by this open-source work and that the way in which intelligence agents are trained had been modified to accommodate the shift. A growing portion of the military’s $50 billion budget would be spent on this data analytics work, he claimed, creating a “gold rush” for contractors.

AustralianPolitics;868k6w;1521689315.0;/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/868k6w/compulsory_voting_and_big_data/;Compulsory voting and big data;"Just curious to get your thoughts on this. I don't really see this being talked about at all, and I think it's a concern.So, only a handful of countries throughout the world have *enforced* compulsory voting. I think about 12 in the whole word. Australia, obviously, is one of them.  Big data can create incredibly personalized and targeted advertisements. That's all well and good for products and other general consumer things, but what about politics?I think compulsory voting enhances the effect that big data can have on politics. People who are completely uninformed suddenly get an ad on their phone with fear mongering or emotional tugging and they vote based on their feelings rather than brains. The reason I think compulsory voting adds to this issue, is because I'm willing to bet that most of these emotional and uninformed people wouldn't even be making it to the polls to begin with. The fact that we are essentially forced to means these people will think emotionally and vote with their heart rather than their brain. No one wants to sit and analyze policies, so they'll just cast their mind back a few weeks, remember the sensationalist headline or ad and vote based on that. What do I think the longer term effects are? Well, it's already kind of happening. Parties win based on emotion and charisma rather than policies. This isn't unique to countries with compulsory voting (USA springs to mind), but I think compulsory voting is a catalyst for this sort of political landscape. I think it makes it so much easier to target emotional and ""manipulative"" ads when the entire nation has to partake in voting. I think, and this is getting a bit conspiracy-like, that the reason we've seen some very questionable policies come into effect is because of targeted political ads mixed with compulsory voting. People who are immensely uniformed are, for a lack of a better word, being 'guided' towards voting for certain parties based on their stance on emotional issues.So, curious to hear your thoughts on the matter :) EDIT: My post isn't about the efficacy of compulsory vs. non-compulsory voting - it's about the efficacy of big data and propaganda used to sway elections in a compulsory environment vs. a non-compulsory one. Simply because you don't need to figure out who will vote and who wont - you assume everyone is voting and target accordingly. When using big data, stuff like that makes it so much easier to work with. ";"Look at the shitshow in the US with the opposite, very low turn out. Who's politics is more extreme and partisan?  No mandatory voting changes the political calculus from convincing people to making people that already agree with you afraid enough to go vote. It's why you have so many more single issue voters there. Emotion and charisma is vastly more dangerous without mandatory voting.#[removed]#I think compulsory voting works to prevent rather than enhance polarisation and the so called emotion voting.  Targeted ads are best used to encourage populations to vote when they do not have to, they would be much less successful where everyone has to vote anyway.#Thats what they thought in the USA. But then all the crazys turned out to vote in Donny T. Now they are stuck with him. Compulsory voting ensures we will never have a Donny T, also being a parliamentary government prevens someone with zero political knowlage becoming leader of the country  There is nothing wrong with targeted ads/ campaign. This has been happening for eons. Yes its a stronger weapon now but a political party wanting to talk specifically to their base.... thats just democracy   As for your concern that it makes extreme people more extreme, it does but not just to right wing extremes, left are equally susceptible. While extreme left arnt as dangerous physically as extreme right they bring their own dangers to a country#Voting isn't compulsory. Turning up and getting your name crossed off is though.  And sausage sizzles at polling booths should be!#I think it's wrong that privacy laws don't apply to political parties#Read more, guess less. One of the targeting techniques used in the 2016 US election was to manipulate people who supported Bernie Sanders to not vote.  You've got it arse about.#>People who are completely uninformed suddenly get an ad on their phone with fear mongering or emotional tugging and they vote based on their feelings rather than brains.  1937:  People who are completely uninformed suddenly get an ad in their newspaper with fear mongering or emotional tugging and they vote based on their feelings rather than brains.   1977:  People who are completely uninformed suddenly get an ad in their newspaper with fear mongering or emotional tugging and they vote based on their feelings rather than brains.  #It’s just as likely compulsory voting protects our system from manipulation by data driven targeting.   After all Trump and Brexit - two outcomes not reflecting actual majority preferences in their eligible electorate - occurred in nations without compulsory voting. And now it seems that data driven targeting was a factor in each.  In the absence of compulsory voting its the voter who cares about a single emotive issue who can be motivated (manipulated) to get up and vote that can determine the outcome. Big data can and now has been used to target voters with very narrow interests who may otherwise stay home on Election Day.   It might be regrettable but perhaps people with moderate balanced views and open minds are so because they are less tribal or less worked up about immigrants or baby killers or government tyranny or a hundred other hot button issues. And maybe moderates are less likely to vote if they don’t have to. In which case without compulsory voting policies will tend to pander to tribes and become contradictory and chaotic as a result.  I think it is likely that, by keeping moderates in play, compulsory voting makes it harder to use big data to game the system. Educated or not, it’s the passionate who have the strongest biases and who are as a result most likely to be manipulated.   There is also the effect on marginal efficacy. The larger the percentage of the enfranchised exercising their vote the greater the number of voters data driven targeting has to manipulate to alter the outcome.   We do need to be concerned. But I don’t think big data presents a prima face case against compulsory voting. It may in fact be quite the opposite.#> they vote based on their feelings rather than brains.  So Greens voters?  I think How To Vote cards should be banned first. Why should morons be told how to vote? Research or vote 1.   >This isn't unique to countries with compulsory voting (USA springs to mind)  Isn't it strange how the left here and in the US were all on board with Zuckerborg and youtube when they were - as Obama's political advisor stated ""on their side"" - but when Hillary crashed and burned there's suddenly all this hysteria about swaying the public with ads. That's politics.  I do think politicians or political parties should be able to sue for defamation is their opposition slanders them in ads or during speeches. It would be very interesting to see what would happen then."

baseball;85urzi;1521568367.0;/r/baseball/comments/85urzi/is_moneyball_the_worst_thing_that_couldve/;Is Moneyball the worst thing that could’ve happened to the A’s?;By Moneyball, I mean the book, not the strategy. Had Michael Lewis never written Moneyball — had Beane never granted access to the A’s’ inner workings to Lewis and allowed the information to be published — the A’s could have continued to corner the sabermetric market for years to come, essentially creating a powerhouse (albeit one akin to a college team, with parts frequently being replaced after 4-5 years due to cost). Sure, the strategy would’ve likely spread across the bigs due to employees getting jobs with other teams, but it seems that Moneyball and its trade secrets accelerated the process. Perhaps the A’s would have been a juggernaut by the time the use of sabermetrics really spread.And what did the A’s miss out on in the process? Surely they’d have received more money from more fans in the stands (though how much is of course open to speculation), more playoff revenue, more merchandise sales, and more attention overall. Hell, maybe the stadium situation would have been solved already, with excitement about the team and goodwill from them winning making parties more amenable to acquiring land for the new park. Maybe Cisco Field would’ve been built downtown, attracting 25,000 fans a game to its convenient location and leading to a big local TV contract, turning the A’s into a big-money team and players for superstar free agents. It worked for the Giants  why not the A’s?This is all speculation, of course. That said, if Billy Beane had decided to keep his strategy and his methods under wraps for a few more years, they would have leaked out in a much slower way, allowing them to corner the big-data market long enough for the A’s to have erased their current longtime ills. And yes, I exaggerate by saying “the worst thing that could’ve happened” — of course there are worse events that could’ve happened, like death or disaster or contraction. That said, what if Moneyball really hurt the A’s’ chances?;I think if the A's truly believed that they could have kept their methods a secret for longer, they wouldn't have allowed Lewis the access to write the book. #Probably not. Paul DePodesta went to the Dodgers in 2004, so it would have gotten out eventually. It still took teams quite some time to adapt, even with the manual.#I have a hard time believing the A's were the only organization in the league that had considered using sabermetrics more heavily in scouting/building. Doubtless they were the leaders at the time, but I'm sure other teams had begun to consider the possibility, even if they were far behind. I can't imagine the A's would've allowed the book to be written if they thought they could keep their methodology a secret.#The implication here is the that the A's were using sabermetrics on the sly and the book exposed that.  This is a false narrative.  Even ignoring that other teams were using analytics at the same time as the A's, they all knew what the A's were doing anyway.  The Red Sox tried to hire Beane, as well as J.P. Ricciardi, before settling on Theo Epstein.  They hired Epstein (and Bill James) before *Moneyball* was published.  Despite what Lewis thinks (he claims that the book ruined the A's competitive advantage), I would be surprised if a single front office guy picked up that book as was surprised by anything in it.  If it did anything, it slightly sped up the adoption of sabermetrical analysis in MLB, due to pressure from fans.  There's actually a decent book called *[The Beauty Of Short Hops](https://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Short-Hops-Circumstance-Moneyball/dp/0786462884),* in which they theorize that the A's success had almost nothing to do with their Moneyball approach, and everything to do with having three dominant starting pitchers (Zito, Mulder, and Hudson) at the time Lewis wrote the book.  The authors argue that the A's were almost always at the bottom of the league in runs scored, and that their success was predicated upon star players that everyone knew about (the aforementioned trio of pitchers, along with guys like Miguel Tejada and Eric Chavez), and that the scrubs and nobodies that Beane picked off the scrap heap were a nice story, but ultimately not the primary reason for the team's success.#Nothing that the A's were doing was really a secret. Branch Rickey was doing some similar things in the 40s and 50s. Before the writing of the book there was a significant and growing online community that was very familiar with what was going on. Imo, the biggest drivers in the late '90s were Rob Neyer (his ESPN column was the way in for lots of people), Baseball Prospectus (before the paywall), and Baseball Think Factory (the best mix of popularity and scholarship).  Teams weren't adapting to this because old baseball guys thought it was bullshit. The 'Fire Joe Morgan' website was a place where the old v new school fight was crystallized. Schur took time to really pick apart the way that Morgan thought about the game. General Managers and front offices in the 90s were very different than they are now.#Even after the book came out, it still took a decade for most of the rest of the league to catch on.   EDIT: The A's win totals in the 4 years after Moneyball came out: 96, 91, 88, 93. The downfall of the early-mid 2000's A's was them not being able to keep up with the big money contracts. #It just gave the movement a name. Guys like Epstein soon emerged, and used some of the same tactics with a budget and found success. #Teams would have noticed at some point. Plus, the A's have still been ahead of the curve in some aspects recently - they developed/targeted fly ball hitters for the 2012-2014 teams (Donaldson and Moss most notably) and Khris Davis a couple years ago. #Would have leaked eventually. After 2002, everyone started tryong to poaching the A's front office. They still do, but on a lesser level because the rich teams can now afford to pay all the best minds in the game. #No, Oakland is the worst thing that could've happened to the A's.#I don’t think money ball gave any particular deep insight into sabermetrics. Plus wasn’t all of bill James books already available #no.

At this point I'm done putting up my money to take exams.  When is it time to give up on pursuing an actuarial career?";"You are really good on paper which means you should easily be able to get interviews. If you are lacking here, it means there is something wrong with your presentation. Talk to someone professional who is an ass hole and he will tell you what is putting them off.#>  When is it time to give up on pursuing an actuarial career?  Only you can really answer that.   It sounds like you're having trouble selling your skill set. This isn't actuary-specific problem so much as a life skills problem. No matter what you decide to do, if you want to be successful you need to be able to articulate your skills to people.   If you dropped out of the PhD program, you should have a masters. If not, then go back to finish a graduate degree and this time around take advantage of your school's relationships with employers. #Are you restricting yourself to a certain geographic area? #You got this.   * Keep your chin up. You have a resume that most EL candidates would kill for.   * I would recommend pausing the exams for now. Four is very solid (anything more might make you an expensive EL candidate).   * Review your interviewing/interpersonal skills. That's the only area that you could possibly improve (you're very impressive elsewhere).    * Find some folks to do mock interviews with, preferably people that will give you the best honest feedback.    * Your writing seems fine, but in case english isn't your first language, make written & verbal communication a heavy priority.   Seriously though - this is not the resume to be going ""I need to give up."" That shouldn't even be a consideration. #i don't know how common this is, but i've heard several managers say they won't consider candidates with a PhD#I don't think passing more exams would help at this point. I don't know how good your interview skills are but that might be an issue in your case otherwise keep searching for an actuarial analyst job till your eyes bleed. If you still can't find anything for several months, find a different career.#Just move into data science and collect your FSA money. There's no point in doing actuarial if you've already invested so much into it with zero return, unless you really like insurance for whatever reason.  The exams are just so mind numbingly boring anyways.#As others have said, you have a lot of potentially relevant experience and proven exam success.  Reach out to actuaries, not just for jobs, but to network.  Get to know a few actuaries and see if you can get a position out of that.    There are networking opportunities through the SOA - one of which will be at the Life and Annuity Symposium in Baltimore, MD in early May.  If you are nearby, consider registering for the Candidate Connect event.#How old are you?#If you are very interested in actuarial science, keep trying.  If you are only interested in money, or you are looking for a technical profession, do not pursue actuarial science. The exams are a false promise of mathenatics/statistics heavy work. You will not use any of this material in 90% of actuarial roles  Seeing you are a former PhD student, I get the feeling that rigorous work is something you are after. If this is the case, there are many better options for you.#Ya, I agree with some others here.  You have to find out what's turning employers away.  Have you ever followed up with an employer that interviewed but didn't hire and ask why?  Could be something simple.#You might want to consider an internship first. Exams are great but employers want to see that you are experienced in the actuarial field before they will hire you.#I think you are fairly old and potentially competing in the wrong bucket. Your actuarial credentials are very good for entry level but your age an experience should be of a senior management level, which is why you may have an issue searching for a role. Also, i think the lack of financial industry experience here definitely hurts you. I think you should market yourself more as a specialist, maybe finish your research and try to get in a big bank as an analytics expert etc.. as i think the road for actuarial may be really tough for you#The exams only get harder and more full of useless memorization.  Maybe pursue data science."
WikiLeaks;85sqji;1521552881.0;/r/WikiLeaks/comments/85sqji/how_obamas_team_used_big_data_to_rally_voters/;How Obama’s Team Used Big Data to Rally Voters (2012 article);"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/509026/how-obamas-team-used-big-data-to-rally-voters/Stumbled across this article from 2012 this morning.  The more I think about it, the more I see what happened this election.  This system of data mining began in 2002 and is increasing its intelligence exponentially.  Those that can turn this data into useful targeting ads (GWB, Obama, Trump) can turn an election upside down or sway it in a manner that traditional means haven't figured out yet.  Data is fluid and changes and the old guard seems to think that a one time cursory look suffices.  My belief is that Clinton saw the data and tried to change it by being the loudest voice in the room rather than conform to what it was saying.  I saw many of my friends (that volunteered for her) try to create a ""facebook"" dialogue about her that came across as fake (fakebook).  They became their own echo chamber and forgot that it was easy to sway supporters...not so easy to sway opposition or those on the fence.How will it be in the future?  The article points out that the DNC purchased cable dvr history and matched it to key players in areas.  I think cable companies will be the next to answer questions.  I think the country talks for a short period about what data is collected about us and I think that this is the new norm.  Nothing will happen.  Elections have evolved before our own eyes.The big question that each candidate or opposition will need to answer from here on out will be:  Has the amount of people talking about my candidate positively changed or has the voice been amplified in an attempt to change the data?>In many respects, analytics had made it possible for the Obama campaign to recapture that style of politics. Though the old guard may have viewed such techniques as a disruptive force in campaigns, they enabled a presidential candidate to view the electorate the way local candidates do: as a collection of people who make up a more perfect union, each of them approachable on his or her terms, their changing levels of support and enthusiasm open to measurement and, thus, to respect. “What that gave us was the ability to run a national presidential campaign the way you’d do a local ward campaign,” Simas says. “You know the people on your block. People have relationships with one another, and you leverage them so you know the way they talk about issues, what they’re discussing at the coffee shop.”>Davidsen, whose previous work had left her intimately familiar with the rich data sets held in set-top boxes, understood that a lot of that data was available in the form of tuner and DVR histories collected by cable providers and then aggregated by research firms. For privacy reasons, however, the information was not available at the individual level. “The hardest thing in media buying right now is the lack of information,” she says.>Davidsen began negotiating to have research firms repackage their data in a form that would permit the campaign to access the individual histories without violating the cable providers’ privacy standards. Under a $350,000 deal she worked out with one company, Rentrak, the campaign provided a list of persuadable voters and their addresses, derived from its microtargeting models, and the company looked for them in the cable providers’ billing files. When a record matched, ­Rentrak would issue it a unique household ID that identified viewing data from a single set-top box but masked any personally identifiable information.";"While much of what you say is valid, I don't think that much can be learned from Hillary's defeat. For too many, the 2016 election was all about rejecting ""business as usual"" in Washington, of which Hillary was a charter member. The Republicans saw it and dumped Jeb (i.e. wanna-be Bush III). The Democrats didn't, cheated Bernie, and kept Hillary (i.e. wanna-be Clinton II). There would have been no way to spin the ex-first lady's / Secretary of State's image in that regard no matter what anybody said on Facebook or anywhere else.#To the only other comment here - dude, you've been shadowbanned."

For those who have or have not seen this paper \([https://www.reddit.com/r/Against\_Astroturfing/comments/84ipa1/\_/dvputaz/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Against_Astroturfing/comments/84ipa1/_/dvputaz/)\), The paper itself is available here:[https://towardsdatascience.com/caveat\-emptor\-computational\-social\-science\-8c2c2d5a7cc5](https://towardsdatascience.com/caveat-emptor-computational-social-science-8c2c2d5a7cc5).  I'd like to make a response and answer any questions from others pertaining to how I collect Reddit data.  The paper itself was nicely done, and although I do not agree with all of the conclusions in the paper, the paper itself was excellent and highlights the necessity for researchers to confirm the integrity of any data that they use for academic purposes.It will take a while for me to properly address the major points in the paper, but I would like to provide an open forum for others to ask questions about the methodology and procedures I use when collecting Reddit data.  I recommend that everyone read the paper and get familiar with the major points within the study.I would like to make a quick response now and say that throughout the process of collecting and publishing these datasets, I have learned a great deal about the ins and outs of Reddit's API as well as better managing the process of big data collection and improving on my efforts to ensure that the data that I collect is as complete as possible given the fact that a lot of the data is constantly changing and evolving through time.  A majority of the data that was missing from the archives was focused on Reddit's earlier years \(2009 and earlier\).  There was also gaps in the data from the Reddit Blackout in July of 2015 that affected some of the data in the archives due to subreddits going private while I was ingesting data.  Once I have time to properly address the concerns in this study, I will follow up with an explanation of what caused these issues and what I learned from the process and how I am now addressing the various issues that caused gaps in the data due to different circumstances.If anyone has questions, please feel free to ask them here and I will do my best to answer as quickly as possible.  I will be following up soon with more details and addressing the various issues that I faced collecting Reddit data.Thank you!**Edit:**  I am reingesting submissions and will be replacing the RS_yyyy-mm files with RS2_yyyy-mm files to signify the second revision.  I will still keep the old files for academic purposes and will place them in an ""old"" directory.  The new submission files will be as complete as possible for the early years of Reddit.  I may just reingest all submissions because Reddit changed their scoring algo and the current submissions have the old adjusted scores.  The new files (RS2) will have the updated scores.  I will still keep the retrieved_on key which gives the epoch time of when I collected the data.  I estimate it will take a couple months to update and reingest all submissions.  I will replace the 2006-2010 period as quickly as possible.  I estimate it will take several weeks to complete that.Since there are far more comments than submissions, I will first work to make sure the early period of Reddit is complete and then decide how to proceed with the later years.  ";After how many days do you update threads/comments with new vote counts?#From the study,  > Missing comment IDs could be attributed to many possible causes. These IDs could be dangling references, public information that for some reason were not returned by Reddit’s systems to Baumgartner’s software at that moment, or **information that was part of a community that had set its discussions to be private**.  It seems to me the lion's share of missing data would be part of private communities.  In that case, it wouldn't really be missing data, per se.

The team has positioned themselves in a strategic niche, a new implementation of ELD (eletronic data mandate) - essentially devices for electronic logging, is now mandatory to ALL truckers starting December 2019. I've been slowly watching ARY and the team, and appreciate the use-case their applying ARY and the network to.  A nice neutral article regarding ARY, its network, use-cases, and development.

Thankfully prices have been low enough that a masternode is incredibly affordable.  I imagine that will likely change after the announcement, but who knows. #I looked at ARY very briefly  a month or so ago, but it seemed like they were a long way out on their roadmap. And the team was pretty small. I didn’t buy any because I felt like the price was a bit high for where it was at.   It’s good to see updates and I’ll take another look into it. ERC20 token? Any plans for their own chain?#Show me the roadmap #nice cant wait for april!#US based and SEC compliance is probably one of the most important features of this token.

China and Russia have similar geopolitical interests and were soft partners during the Cold War. Russia also learned some of its active measures techniques having ruled for centuries certain areas of northern Asia and sharing a border.   China is way better at active measures given it nearly invented them with Sun Tzu’s, “Art of War” in 500 BC.   My educated guess is that China understands the populist rise in the West. It is in their interest to promote anti-democratic sentiments and are likely involved with Russia and others to discredit western democracy and egalitarianism. China will be much better at doing this under cover and we will likely not have the full picture. See the recent scandal that rocked 60 admirals in the Navy via Fat Lenard and Asia. The dude was so deep in our shit he was selling Asia our submarine positions and controlling where our aircraft carriers docked. #^The linked tweet was tweeted by [@911CORLEBRA777](https://twitter.com/911CORLEBRA777) on Mar 31, 2018 19:07:50 UTC (49 Retweets | 109 Favorites)  -------------------------------------------------  [@thespybrief](https://twitter.com/thespybrief) [@ericgarland](https://twitter.com/ericgarland) [@LouiseMensch](https://twitter.com/LouiseMensch) [@DrDenaGrayson ](https://twitter.com/DrDenaGrayson )So, to sum up this thread.Ko Chun Shun sits on the boards of Emerdata, Cambridge Analytica, &amp  Kuangchi Science, &amp  Prince's FSG all but one being Big Data collection &amp  analytics companies.Dorian Barak is a Director of an FSG subsidiary &amp  sits on Kuangchi's board.

AskFeminists;85xg9l;1521588178.0;/r/AskFeminists/comments/85xg9l/how_important_do_you_believe_big_data_was_in_the/;How important do you believe “Big Data” was in the radicalization of anti-feminist sentiment? (And others);I’ve been thinking on this one since the Channel 4 reports on Cambridge Analytica began rolling out.  If you haven’t seen them thus far, they are pretty essential to understanding the scope of what’s happened.  I would start [here](https://youtu.be/mpbeOCKZFfQ) to get directly to how this affects us, but I’ll give a brief layperson’s summary below (might not be perfectly detailed or accurate, but I myself am a layman in this context):Per Channel 4’s investigation, Cambridge Analytica, a corporate data analytics and communications company, collected data from Facebook on over 50 million people, ranging from political views and activity, personality traits, demographics data, and possibly even psychological indicators.  (Zuckerberg and Facebook’s influence isn’t known, but it’s assumed that the data was given willingly.)From there, Cambridge Analytica paired with several other organizations and actors in order to engage in psychographics, or what could best be described as psy-ops, using the American election as an example:-	Steve Bannon, owner of Brietbart and former board member of Cambridge Analytica (left to join the Trump campaign), who used Brietbart to create and disseminate data-driven fake news for the purpose of stoking and aggravating fears of right-leaning voters-	Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, at this point regarded as part of Russia’s disinformation arm, to release slow leaks targeted at aggravating similar right-wing sentiments and undermining the credibility of Trump’s opposition-	Facebook, using hyper-targeted advertisements and ‘suggested’ stories to create an individualized, fabricated, often fake news feed driven by data collected from Facebook-	Russian troll farms, which received the same Facebook analytics data Cambridge Analytica received, to disseminate fake news and disinformation, derail discussion, and act as bad-faith agitators on Facebook, Twitter, and RedditPer campaign finance sunshine laws, we know that the Trump campaign, as well as the Mercer family and other billionaire donors, paid Cambridge Analytica tens of millions of dollars through Trump’s campaign and through Super PACs.  We also know Trump (& team) and the Mercers have met directly  Trump and Cambridge Analytica have met directly  the Mercers and Cambridge Analytica have spoken directly  and both the Trump campaign and the Mercers have reached out to Assange to amplify WiliLeaks’ message.  We do not know how much, if any, Putin and other Russian oligarchs have paid to Cambridge Analytica (they are not affected by campaign finance laws as the American donors are).We also know Cambridge Analytica played a similar role, likely with many of the same actors, in the #Brexit campaign.  Alexander Nix, head of Cambridge Analytica, has boasted about engaging in over 200 such campaigns worldwide.Okay, with all that in mind, my questions:**How significant do you feel “Big Data” (hyper-targeted disinformation, fake news, psy-ops campaigns, Astroturfing) is in aggravating and radicalizing anti-feminist sentiments, either as a campaign goal or a corollary to other campaign goals?**  Do you believe antipathy towards feminism has been drummed up or even fabricated in some cases to act as a convenient wedge issue, and to drive interest and voter engagement up on the other side?  Do you believe these sentiments would have fostered organically at the rate they have, or even at all, if not for the presence of bad actors and disinformation acting with coordination on a multinational scale?**How does this affect the culpability of anti-feminists who have been engaged in this manner?**  There is a saying that “if you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product.”  In this case, how culpable is the “product” for their engagement as a response to this campaign?  Yes, much of what happened was Cambridge Analytica (and related actors) playing on existing fears and biases, and propaganda is nothing new as a concept, but it was also done this time in such an intrusive way as to literally reshape each targeted person’s reality to fit their agenda.  In a very real way, the media we consume shapes our reality, and the media these people consumed—the targeted “news” stories pushed to them, the hyper-targeted advertisements and ‘suggested’ filters, the hijacking of groups and astroturfing within their social networks—turned their reality into a fundamentally different one at all levels.  Obviously, culpability for one’s own actions falls to them, but at what point does the blame for the belief which informs that action fall to the bad-faith actors who have constructed a false social reality around these “products”?**What do we do about it?** Feminism is in at least some part about messaging and outreach, as dedicated feminists alone cannot achieve all their goals in a timely fashion: there needs to be some coalition-building and broader community engagement to achieve many broader goals.  Some people may need to be dragged kicking and screaming into the achievement of these goals, but that’s the case for all progressive movements.  But if there are potentially tens of millions of people whose worldviews are being shaped by propaganda personalized to exploit *their* weaknesses—if their perceptions are being carefully constructed around them by bad faith actors—if their *realities* are different from ours as a result—how reachable are these people, really?  And if these methods are successful and pervasive enough to force people to the margins on a large enough scale to drive policy and turn elections, what can we do about it?  What *should* be done about it?;"May I suggest also asking other subreddits like /r/Anarchism, /r/Socialism, or any leftist subreddit in general?  There’s some tech-anarchist subreddits too but I forget them at the moment.#Julian Assange is a dumbass, no doubt about it. But labeling his tragic little soap operas ""part of Russia’s disinformation arm"" is as dumb as Assange himself. What you've happened to discover is, as we've always known, the real subversive-right has always been homegrown: Bannon, Breitbart, the Mercers, the Kochs, Fox News, Donald Trump, Project Veritas, the CIA, Peter Thiel, and so many other deplorables. That they may find common cause with petty little oligarchs or sad little Australians should not let us get distracted that this is a very American problem, with very American roots. (Is it not Facebooks complete dedication to extracting advertising dollars from any source the *cause* to which Cambridge Analytica put their big data to real effect?)#I could write more but I’m tired, so I’m just gonna say for now “duh” of course they’re gonna drum up anti-feminist support. That’s what right wing people do.  Are the anti-feminists culpable? Complicit I think is a better word that acknowledges patriarchy is the responsible party that has coerced these vulnerable men.  Cambridge Analytica needs to be destroyed.  I’m excited to hear what other people here have to say though :)#[removed]"
statistics;88mhqw;1522537798.0;/r/statistics/comments/88mhqw/has_anyone_moved_from_statistics_to_ai_is_it_even/;Has anyone moved from statistics to AI? Is it even readable?;Hi, I'm a biostatistician. I work in clinical trials on sample calculations, analysis, maybe simulations once in a while.   I see lots of interesting new developments in machine learning. And two things come to mind :  -My job is probably going to be swallowed by big data analysis. *Not necessarily AI taking over my job, just RCT/observational studies becoming obsolete compared to the use of huge datasets and machine learning analysis methods*. Eg. **Google Verily, using technology and masses of data to identify positive health outcomes**. I imagine this will affect other stats fields also, not just medical.     -It looks very exciting, compared to what I'm doing.      As statisticians, are we able to transition into big data and machine learning? The skillset seems entirely different.;"So, as a statistician did you look carefully into what is called by ""machine learning"" method-wise? Fancy terminology aside how different it is from methods you regularly use? There was this thourougly unscientific poll somewhere asking ""data scientists"" what method they use the most. I belive 70% of them proudly use linear regression. So, i think you will be fine.#Here's the thing: what you're calling ""machine learning"" (deep neural nets/recurrent nets/convolutional nets) don't do anything particularly special besides being able to find patterns in data that may or may not correspond to real, biological phenomena. They take an enormous amount of data and although they can find relationships that a person wouldn't, those findings don't given you any actual mechanistic understanding.   There are and always will be instances in which your sample size is relatively small and yet you must try to theorize and use inference to create testable hypotheses about a certain situation. Machine learning algorithms not only don't possess ""common sense"" they also don't possess ""expert sense"" whereas the bioinformatician does because they have what's called ""domain knowledge. A deep neural network is totally unconstrained by what is reasonable or not because it possesses no ""mental framework"" to constrain it.   Imagine that you feed a neural network a huge amount genetic data from a diversity of human populations and try to have it predict susceptibility to malarial infection risk. It'll pick out certain alleles associated with non-equitorial peoples but it takes an epidemiologist/bioinformatician to be able to conclude ""well of course this is true because malaria and their vectors have territorial overlap at the equator"". The neural net has given you nothing in terms of discovering what mutations confer malarial resistance because all it does is pattern match and has no domain knowledge or mental framework.   Now consider the case of the epidemiologist/bioinformatician that has the skills to wield a neural network appropriately and gives it the same data constrained only to equitorial populations where malaria is known to be prevalent. He/She finds that the mutations associated with certain anemias and thalassemias confer resistance but perhaps also a combination of mutations in IgG proteins not noted in the literature and provides researchers with a new target of investigation. You should notice that these conclusions could have possibly been reached with a ""simpler"" method such as those used in GWAS.  Neural networks may be powerful but they are rarely better than traditional methods. It's often smarter and more interpretable/actionable to use PCA/regression/clustering before trying a network. Using a neural network largely throws away everything we've learned in a domain of science in favor of sheer computational power. Sometimes this is appropriate (because we may know little about a data set) but in most instances it is not.#I was a clinical trials biostatistician and recently (a little over a year ago) moved into a role as a ""big data"" statistician that works on health outcomes. once of the biggest things is that you have to live with the fact that you do not have as much accuracy with big data as you get with randomized clinical trials. Ideally the bigger your data the less you have to sweat the small stuff.   One of the biggest issues we have is that most people do not go to the doctors unless they are not well. Because of this, we will always have a biased control group (yes, even with ICD10 codes which have their own biases.)   Big data allows some wonderful for some retrospective, observations (possibly), perspective (somewhat) ways to find new outcomes and medical insights, but I  believe the gold standard will always be some form of a randomized clinical trial. At least for the near future. Good luck trying to defend a new drug to the FDA without a few Phase 2-3 randomized control trials.   As for the transition:  Coming from classical statistics I was always worried machine learning was ""very complex"" and would take me a long time to learn. Being a statistician, learning all the caveats and assumptions is very important to me and a lot of the current machine learning articles online seem to gloss over the assumptions/ theory for application (*cough *cough Kutner). Once you look into to neural networks/ Markov chains the statistics aren't as difficult as it is hyped up to be.   In fact, from that I have seen, a lot of machine learning uses basic statistical methods coupled with a pretty straightforward computer algorithm.#There's actually a fairly big overlap. There are some technologies in the AI area that are quite different from what you're used to, the jargon is quite different (and to some extent likely to cause confusion with the pre-existing equivalents in statistics, where terms are used to mean something else). Some of the mathematics is different too and not all of it is easy, but by and large if you have a pretty broad knowledge of statistics and some programming and  mathematics a fair amount of the skills will carry over, and you'll just have to learn the parts that are unfamiliar. In some areas the overlap is substantial, in others it's less so (e.g. in vision-related AI, where it's nearly all neural nets, considerably less, but in areas related to prediciton or classification you're usually solving a subset of the same problems statisticians were decades ago, just on much larger data sets than were typically practical to obtain or deal with -- and then the skill sets have more overlap).  [One issue with big data that's often greatly underappreciated is that bias (and in some situations, therefore, generalizability) tends to dominate variance. If your data doesn't look like what you want to make conclusions about, it may not be very useful because of this unrepresentativeness. Some well known ""big data"" statistical studies of decades long past had this very problem.]  Sometimes the AI people end up de-emphasising the overlap -- in some cases partly from ignorance and in other cases partly from wanting to look new and different (it's hard to sell people on those high salaries if it sounds too much like the statistics you're already paying less for).  #I am a clinical pharmacologist so not qualified to answer per se.    In medicine and clinical trials, domain knowledge is fairly important.  Further, drug developers tend to be pretty conservative.  As such, I believe biostats folks who know AI will be the innovators.  AI folks who learn clinical trials will not be as well positioned.  As others have mentioned, a lot of ""machine learning"" is regression.  Big whoop.   Right now, drug development is too segmented.  Phase II protocols are laid out before MAD studies are completed.  Radiolabeled studies are mega informative, but subsequent PK models don't use any priors.   As such: I think adaptive clinical trials will get some momentum.  After that, bayesian adaptive models. #The classical skills of statisticians are especially important in deflating the hype of AI. Deep learning is useful, and the ""best"" tool for a particular set of problems (stuff like computer vision), but it is no panacea and similarly ""big data"" does not hold all the answers. Getting a lot of data because it is available is just one more form of convenience sampling and it will always come back to bite you in the ass if you are not careful. So, no, feeding big data to a deep learning algorithm will not solve all medical problems nor will it make RCTs or observational studies obsolete. It could do better than existing methods for some particular problems for sure but as a new tool, it's not the kind that make all the previous ones obsolete. And as proof, I am joining a huge tech company that knows all about AI, yet they are hiring me for my *classical* statistical skills, as design of experiment is becoming new again in light of the fact that big data often falls into convenience sampling and will not automatically answer the business questions one has. Once the hype of early successes of AI dies down in light of diminishing returns, its place among all the possible tools one can use will become better understood, and make new room for solid statistical training. That said, I would encourage anyone with solid statistical training to learn at least a bit of the machine learning approaches to data science, because those are all the rage, useful tools in many regards, and sometimes in desperate need of good statistical expertise in terms of sampling and design of experiment.#Oops, my phone changed feasable to readable. #You might already be qualified. I think there is a healthy amount of crossover. Your points are fair. The hard part for statisticians might be the programming involved. As a former software dev going into DS, math & stats are the hard part for me whereas I think many of my classmates aren't too comfortable with programming. The point is, there is some trade-off here and having a well-rounded skillset is usually the golden ticket. #I disagree that the Randomized double-blinded clinical trials will ever give away to big data type of AI learning. New treatments will always need some type of human experimentation , and the gold standard will always be randomized trials. Clinical trials are expensive but necessary . What the health care data can show is already shaped by prevailing clinical practice , and in the foreseeable future that is always going to be largely influenced by the professionals . You can’t find something that contradicts the current practice based on data collected using the current practice.  #Hi I basically did the switch from stats ( econometrics ) to ML. My TL DR is yes the switch is possible and ""real"" stats people in the ML commuity are relatively rare and can be very valuable. In my opinion the best test to see if you are ""fit"" is to get the book ""Elements of Statistical Learning"" and skim some chapters. (its free online)  #Ironically, I would be VERY weary of a data scientist handling anything related to making strong assertions on causality.   Google Flu predictions worked really well until it stopped working...."

Here are two of the reading assignments and one of writing exercises that I tried this semester: ""Data and the Law"", ""Big Data in Healthcare"", and an exercise on writing good statistical instructions.All of the required reading is open access. 1. ""Data and the Law"" reading assignment, in which we look at some of the complications of copyright, scientific facts, and compilations.This reading assignment pertains to “Data and the law: Beyond the sweat of the brow. Who owns published data? And what is data?” by Gerald van Belle and Leslie Ruiter, available at https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2014.00737.xQ1) What are some things that the US Copyright Act denies protection to?

Give two other ways that Table 1 could be changed in order to meet the 'modicum of originality' requirement.Q4) What are the restrictions, if any, on making a graph using someone else's data?Q5) Which of the three, EU, USA, and Canada is the most restrictive on copyright law pertaining to data? Which is the least?2. ""Big Data and Healthcare"" reading assignment, in which we look at some of the ways in which big data is changing how hospitals operate.The following 8 questions can be answered by reading the article “Big data analytics in healthcare: promise and potential” by Wullianallur Raghupathi and Viju Raghupathi  in Health Information Science and Systems 2014, 2:3Available at: http://www.hissjournal.com/content/2/1/3Q1) What is more difficult in working with big data in healthcare? Why?Q2) Give two examples of how big data analytics can lead to improved outcomes.Q3) What are some developments or outcomes that can be predicted with big data?Q4) What are the four V's of big data, pertaining to analytics in healthcare?Q5) Give an example of a future application of real-time data.Q6) Name three platform/tool options for conducting big data analytics?Q7) What are the four steps of the methodology of big data analytics?Q8) How did twitter tracking compare to official reports of cholera in Haiti in 2010?3. ""Writing Instructional Material"" assignment, in which we try to describe the steps for performing a standard analysis.In-Class Exercise: Write instructions for someone wishing to make a linear regression model and make some additional predictions from that model. Assume that the user has access to software like R, and has experience with it. Also assume that they don't know which statistics tests and plots are useful.Yours should be about 200 words. The following example is more than 400 words, but shows a lot of what you could run into.Example: Instructions for performing a one-way ANOVA, including diagnostics and post-hoc analysis.1. Check if you data is of the proper type. The response/dependent variable should be a numerical quantity, and the explanatory/independent variable should be a categorical or grouping variable. If one of these isn't true, then ANOVA is not the analysis you want.2. Check the extent of any missing data, if any. If there is some, you may want to remove cases with any missing data, or you may want to impute before continuing. Note that reliable imputation of the group or category may be impossible. Similar considerations may be needed for very small groups.3. Check the residuals of the model from lm() for normality. Do this either by histogram, Q-Qplot, or a formal hypothesis test like Shapiro-Wilks or Anderson-Darling. If there is strong evidence of non-normality, follow the non-parametric route. Otherwise, follow the parametric route.Parametric route4. Use the lm() command to build a model of 'response ~ explanatory', and save that model. Use the anova() command on the saved model to get an anova table.5. The p-value on the right of the ANOVA table is result of testing the hypothesis that all of the group means are equal. If this is small (smaller than some arbitrarily pre-selected alpha, such as 0.05), then continue to the post-hoc test in step 6.6. Perform a Tukey test with the TukeyHSD() command. The differences in each pair of means will be shown in the output. The p-values for group differences are automatically adjusted to the number of groups and pairwise comparisons you have. The null hypotheses being tested in each case is if those two group means in the pair are equal. Any small p-values suggest 'honestly significant' differences between the means.Non-Parametric route4. Perform a Krusal-Walls test (a non-parametric ANOVA) on the data by using the kruskal.test() on 'response ~ explanatory' model. The null hypothesis being tested here is if the mean RANK of each group is the same.5. The p-value given with the Krusal-Walls test indicates if there are any significant differences in the RANK mean of the groups. If this is small (smaller than some arbitrarily pre-selected alpha, such as 0.05), then continue to the post-hoc test in step 6.6. Perform a Wilcoxon test on each pair of means and acquire a p-value for each. Compute an adjusted alpha from you initial family-wide alpha and a multiple testing adjustment such as the Bonferroni, Sidak correction. Alternatively, perform a non-parametric post-hoc test such as a Dunn's Test.Blog mirror: http://www.stats-et-al.com/2018/03/assignments-for-statistical-literacy.html";"Always is good to remember good practice when analysing data.

With all this stuff coming out about data mining and privacy rights, it seems to answer a question I (and many others, it seems) have wondered about Gilead's rise to power. How did they determine who was LGBT, fertile, a criminal (in their Biblical terms), and how to find them? The sheer logistics involved sounded like a nightmare to me. Okay, so Gilead isn't exactly touting being technologically advanced, if anything they're for traditional values. But wouldn't it be so typical of a fascist state to say one thing and do the opposite behind closed doors? If Gilead was to work, there needed to be a pretty solid network of people who were on board in key industries...think tech and big data. If they had access to data on Americans collected via browsing habits, online transactions, location, social media activity, they could know a lot about most people. Hell, they could track down fertile women just by looking at their spending habits over the past 10 years -- did they buy any baby supplies? Contraception? They could bust people for being LGBT by looking at dating apps, facebook posts...there's a lot of possibilities.;"I think that’s believable we know at the higher ups use laptops. It’s believable that they still heavily use technology.   I assumed they tracked down fertility through medical records.   Regarding lgbt they control the government. They nsa shit. #Well considering Facebook straight sells our data to just about anyone. It would be interesting if they had been able to have a storyline about Gilead buying databases of social media use.#""Gott mit uns"" -- The Nazi SS used to put that on their belt buckles.  Translates as ""God with us"".#Social media, dating apps grindr, scruff etc, even google search data is extremely revealing.#Yep,  Watching the show I was thinking exactly this is how they were able to classify large groups of people.  I've been trying to tell people that data privacy is something we should all be concerned about for years now so this article doesn't surprise me.   I am actually kind of glad this Cambridge Analytica scandal happened. Whenever I tried to explain why privacy and data collection was important, I'd always be met with a big shrug, a ""so what"" and a ""things could not really get that bad here"". Now people are starting to see the real life consequences of extensive data collection and the huge amount of power it gives a person or an organization.   I actually can't believe this Cambridge Analytica is even a scandal in the first place. I remember reading an article about how their extensive power in political campaigns right after the election in 2016 (if I find the link I'll post it) and one of the biggest concerns talked about was the ability for companies to sell your data to some ""trusted partner"" and that trusted partner having free reign to sell it to whoever they want for whatever they want. House of Cards even had political candidates targeting voters by their online data as a plotline 2 years before the 2016 election.  In the end what scares me isn't just that Gilead would be able to efficiently be able to implement a system like this by buying data from extensive data collection agencies alone, but that with surveillance laws and technologies like biometrics combined with AI algorithms as advanced as they are today, an underground movement like May Day might not be able to exist. A state like Gilead if using these type of technologies, could virtually stay forever if there is no intervention from foreign powers.  This is a good 5 minutes video showing China as an example of this today.   https://www.wsj.com/video/life-inside-chinas-total-surveillance-state/CE86DA19-D55D-4F12-AC6A-3B2A573492CF.html  The documentary Terms and Conditions Apply was released in 2013 and was all about how companies like Facebook, Google LinkedIn etc... are selling data to third parties. Margaret Atwood was on of the interviewees.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_and_Conditions_May_Apply   This is a whole documentary about the technologies the UK uses everyday to surveil mass populations of people and the advantages and disadvantages:  https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/science-surveillance/#Do you want to simplify reading news?

First we have, what's perhaps best described (though not wholly accurate) as *Intent*  how is this data being used?  We have *the Obama* example which was using data in order to more fairly and representatively redefine the electoral borders. This was done with the *intent* of making the system fairer. Conversely, you have *the Trump* example, which was using this data in order to specifically target 'propaganda' and further peddle 'fake news' in order to swing the election. The *intent* here wasn't fair, it was a weapon being deployed for selfish means.   Second, we have what's perhaps best described (though not wholly accurate) as *Practice*. *The Obama* example used this data in practice very openly, and issued papers detailing what the data points implied and how the presidency was going to enact those data points. Transparency, effectively. *The Channel 4 Undercover Reporters* example meanwhile detailed that CA are more than happy to bribe and setup numerous individual persons using the data collated. This isn't transparent, it's also vergining on immoral.   If you **just** look at ""*Politicians using data points*"" (as-per the majority of the examples listed in OP's post) then there is little to no difference. This is a mistake however, nobody is criticising the use of data generally speaking, it is specifically the *intents* and *practices* deployed by CA (and/or their customers) which is being brought into questions and is being labelled as immoral. *That's* the crux of the debate, not that data-gathering itself is under fire. #Re-watch the interview. Read a bit more.   If you want to make comparisons, then make them, then source them, don't just vomit links in a partisan manner.   Downvote.    #Campaigns have always used data and even deceit to win elections.  There is quite a big difference. The examples you linked, Obama in 2012 relied on obtaining this data from campaign sources like fundraisers or people in the field taking notes. The distribution of materials targetted was then very selective but the biggest deceit was the type of language used and selection of evidence.  The big issue now is that we've got this massive database that everybody willfully participates in and psychological warfare techniques are being used which just involve making random shit up and targetting it in a much much more effective ways than a few letters ever could.  There's always been ethical questions but it's far far more pressing with how effective this sort of thing can be implemented. When it goes as far as making up that a political candidate stole money from a third world country (a lot of Haitian voters in the key state of Florida were targetted with this and turnout was low) or that they are demonic satanic paedophiles and it gets to the stage where vulnerable young people on the spectrum are believing this shit and even occasionally inciting physical violence, that seems a big worry to me.  If I had to sum it up and make a key distinction I'd say that the key difference is theft and the ethical issue of being able to stir up mass hatred in a way that other types of campaigning can't do.#https://www.channel4.com/news/cambridge-analytica-revealed-trumps-election-consultants-filmed-saying-they-use-bribes-and-sex-workers-to-entrap-politicians-investigation  Seems worth a scandal even if you feel they're old tactics, don't you think?  Also, the post comes off a bit as whataboutery given an unflinching focus on Obama (particularly in a UK sub), but I think it's right to raise wider questions about use of data in politics. The ongoing ICO investigation currently involves 30 entities.#>Having watched the C4 reports I cannot see anything that Analytica did that has not been done by both journalists and political campaigners almost since elections began.  * Nix - “send some girls around to the candidate’s house”, adding that Ukrainian girls “are very beautiful, I find that works very well”.  * Nix - “We’ll offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance, we’ll have the whole thing recorded, we’ll blank out the face of our guy and we post it on the Internet.”  * “…Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company… so often we set up, if we are working then we can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists, there’s so many options we can look at. I have lots of experience in this.”  #>Why is this even a scandal?  Because the wrong team won.  You're spot on, prepare to be downvoted into the depths.#Op   It appears you asked a question, normally the purpose of that is to enable communication.   Many people have come back to you, but you haven't acknowledged any of the comments or indeed replied to any of them.   Would it be cynical of me to assume that you are being disingenuous and just wanted to post some whataboutisms? #Alexander, is that you? I'm sorry the board suspended you and all that.#Two main differences  1) They are better at it than the old guard and have won elections for anti establishment types  2) They nicked the data they used  The second one is ofc terrible and needs sorting. But theres a wider debate to be had here about exactly how free people are to make decisions.  Theres a reason that debate is not being gone into - here it is  If people can be swayed easily by advertising then the two systems our whole society is based on - free market economics and democracy - and completely and utterly compromised.  Huge irony in defenders of globalised trade and liberal democracy essentially saying that neither system fucking works!#Honestly there's a lot of people still looking to find a way to square the circle of the failures of neoliberalism that led us to Brexit. All the media elite were shocked and many insulated middle to upper class people just couldn't see this coming.   That doesn't change the fact that what Cambridge did was fucking nasty af. But I think a bit of reflection would show this is similar in goals to most political campaigning and PR firm cuntery.   It's just mixed in with a little bit of fear of technology. And for good reason - this stuff is much more powerful and targeted. We saw it in the US when instead of spreading positive messages about Trump they would target African American communities with Clinton quotes about how she hated black people to discourage them from voting.   It's blurring plenty of lines between advertising and propaganda that were already pretty blurred. Just now it's a) more clear and b) goes firmly against what the majority of the political commentariat wanted.  Fairly sure not many will agree with me but that's my take.#Some people have decided to shoot them down.#https://manueldelia.com/2018/03/cambridge-analytica-psyops-methods-were-used-in-malta/  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brexiteer-hard-brexit-eu-passport-buy-malta-christopher-chandler-single-market-customs-union-a8185336.html  Makes u think#[deleted]"

Edit: To say nothing of the apparent extortion  and bribery schemes, of course. But those appear to be separate from the data.#You might want to ask this over in /r/neutralpolitics#Long story short  we don't know because we don't know exactly how the data was used by CA, or the Obama and Clinton campaigns for that matter.  We know that they were roughly doing the same kinds of work and that Clinton's campaign was substantially larger than Trump's and that it made use of the same types of social media analyses that CA is famous for.  The current controversy surrounds comments made by the CEO that suggested they would be happy to arrange to entrap a potential candidate in a sexual scandal.  They also alluded to spreading fake news via social media.  Clearly these sorts of practices are not acceptable and if they turn out to be true the company will probably not survive.  Neither of those involve big data, however there is the matter of their use of data obtained via social media, which is a little more complex.  Back in the day, Facebook set up their API to encourage developers to make apps for Facebook.  Companies responded and apps like FarmVille Bejewelled, etc began to appear.  Part of the API allowed developers access to parts of your Facebook data (status updates, likes, location information, etc) **and also** parts of your friends Facebook data, without requiring your friends' explicit consent.  This means that one of your friends could use an app that would garnish the app's developer with access to your status updates, likes, location, etc. and you would have been non-the wiser.  But crucially, **you agreed to this** when you signed up to the Facebook terms and conditions (that big long wall of text that you never read).  It's surprising that there wasn't more of an outcry about this at the time but in 2015 Facebook quietly ended the practice, so it's not going on any more.  However, developers were not required to delete the information they had harvested unless explicitly asked to (by the friends of the people that didn't know... you get the picture).  A company called Global Science Research created a Facebook app called This is my digital life, a quiz or questionnaire of some sort that was supposed to be an academic research tool.  They harvested Facebook data according to the Facebook ""no friend of mine deserves any privacy"" regime and sold it on for profit.  CA is alleged to have been one of the purchasers of this information (it's possible other campaigns bought and used it as well).  As for what Cambridge Analytica actually did with the Facebook data? Ironically that's the bit we're more clear on.  They model and analyse social media data in the same way that the Obama campaign did so successfully and the Clinton campaigned try to ape (albeit less fruitfully).    * People are shocked that Facebook were so cavalier with their data (although we tried to warn them at the time) in instituting a system that seems purpose built for this type thing to happen. * People are surprised that data ostensibly collected by GSR for 'academic' purposes ended up being sold on the open market.   * People are, for some reason, angry that CA analysed data from Facebook (despite the fact that Obama did it twice and Hillary was doing her best to). * People are unsurprised that their friends didn't read the Facebook TOS, which ultimately caused the whole thing because if people had known what they were agreeing to when they signed up to Facebook they would never have done it.    People *ought* to be angry that Facebook essentially gave away their data to app developers.  Instead they're angry at the people who helped Trump get elected.  It's understandable that an emotional response would get directed towards the thing you hate.  I just hope in the coming months and years, when the regulators and legislators try and sort out this mess they direct attention where it's needed.#* CA stole data from Facebook (likely others)  * CA entered into an agreement with Trump Campaign, but the whole operation was funded by Mercer, who may have leverage over Trump * CA very likely conspired with Russian organizations to amplify the effect of their disinformation campaign (e.g. the 13 Russians that were indicted last month)  * CA/Russia were not simply advertising, they were using fake FB profiles, fake Reddit accounts to sway opinions in online groups  A normal campaign would hire the data firm and pay for it themselves. And, obviously, not work alongside foreign agents which is illegal.  See this comment for another theory: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/85v9xy/exposed_undercover_secrets_of_trumps_data_firm/dw0i5ib/#The Russians were not involved.#From what I understand, the data Trump used was involuntary whereas other campaigns used voluntary info given.#Obama and Hillary's were using participants that opted in, CA used a loophole to take data from the friends of the people that opted in, so 250k opted in, but they gathered data on 50 million that did not opt it. They claimed it was for ""academic"" purposes only, held onto the data after they claimed they deleted it and then also passed it onto third parties without authorization.#You could expand this question to how is it different from anyone using the massive sets of data available to target anyone?  In a way this reminds me of people getting upset when others film them in public ""without permission"".  The odds of them already being filmed by a cctv system is already pretty high.  In the same way, people are go ape shit over this story but stay tuned for the commercial breaks. #But political parties do this too, they target the swing states with their campaigns.#Nothing is different. People are still looking for any way to get trump out of office. Anything at all even if it something their candidate did as well. #Not at all. CA lifted public data while FB sold Obama that data. I want to know about how much user data soyblue lifted. Either way fuck facebook and cuckerberg.#For one, it's proven and not just a dumb assumption so you can say 'no u!!!!!!!!'.#Trump. All things Trump is evil. Maybe people will realize that Facebook is working billions and billions but is free. EVERYONE is taking your information and selling it. #'big data' is a retarded name"

But the doubts were already cast aside by improved wage data yesterday. What matters now is that the BoE will confirm market expectations today. The central bankers would have every reason to come across more optimistically. So far the economy seems robust and inflation remains above target. Only the Brexit negotiations entail the most significant risk for the future development of the British economy. After all the old EU principle still applies: nothing has been agreed until everything has been agreed. As a result markets assume that the BoE will not take too clear a stance.

Coca-Cola. From the beginning of the information age there has been an attempt to harness ""Big Data"" for many reasons, to build an accurate picture of  a society or group to improve the functions of government, voting districts, access to services and allocation of resources, and in the ""Right"" hands it can improve the lives of the people it sampled, in the wrong hands it will build a society like what we are seeing in China, a social credit score based on whether you are a ""Good"" citizen.We can't turn back the clock on the information age, nor will we turn off social media, but we do have a choice in who uses this information and why, we have political power still, we have power as consumers, at least for now, we  can have an ""Open"" society with out fear if we make the right decisions now, we Vote for Progressives who will regulate and provide oversite to these creators and consumers of ""Big Data"", but.....time is running out, 1984 is now.";"1984 was peanuts.

docker;86poxk;1521852941.0;/r/docker/comments/86poxk/docker_on_windows_or_docker_on_linux_vm_on_windows/;Docker on Windows or Docker on Linux VM on Windows?;I use Windows 10 on my computer. I need to test an app on Centos Linux that uses various Big Data distributions like Hive, Spark, Cloudera etc. Currently I use Virtualbox VMs but would like to spin up instances more quickly to test things out so I'm trying to see if Docker will work. I'm not deploying or developing anything, just testing and checking how to set things up. Ideally I'd like to incorporate kerberos to use with this as well.Should I install Docker for Windows and use linux containers (with Hyper-V) or should I have a Linux VM via Virtualbox (no Hyper-V) and use Docker on the Linux VM with various Linux containers?;I'd just use Docker for Windows, it's worked great for some Spark stuff I've done. Maybe it's obvious but one thing to remember though is you won't be able to use Virtual Box while Hyper-V is enabled.  Edit: I should add that you can still run virtual machines, you just have to use Hyper-V as your hypervisor instead of Virtual Box.#I just switched to Linux to use docker cause it more closely matches the final infrastructure it will run on. Prefer it by far.#I'd install Linux on a spare harddrive and test out Docker from there.  Other run it on a VM, no need to make life harder for yourself by using a second class citizen.#Just  boils down to which virtualization stack you prefer really. I'd probably just start with docker for windows . Either way you are getting some level of virtualization to start a linux kernel. Docker for windows probably integrates with windows (file sharing, etc) a little smoother than virtualbox, at least that is my experience with docker for mac.#I use docker on windows when I work from home because I'm lazy. It works great, no need for a VM. If what you do would work with docker on Linux, it will work on Windows.#Spark is very resource intensive. I started off using a Hortonworks image but I'm on bare metal now. YMMV. Essentially Docker for Windows *is* using a Linux VM via Hyper-V.  I use a lot of VMWare on my Windows workstation so Hyper-V is a deal-killer.
consulting;86vabn;1521919179.0;/r/consulting/comments/86vabn/advice_for_an_inexperienced_management_consultant/;Advice for an inexperienced Management Consultant;Hello everybody!Thank you in advance for taking your valuable time to read this post.I have worked in a small consulting firm since I graduated almost 3 years ago. I never expected to get into this business, nor I had ever imagined that I would specialize in Human Resources Management.Since the firm is small, I have had a very prominent role in all the projects we have led  conducting a lot of research  leading behavioral pattern interviews to define and create job descriptions  studying business processes through observation and quantitative analysis, etc. The foregoing I have managed pretty much on my own with the mentorship and direction of my employer (a management consultant with 40+ years of experience and founder of the company).However, I want to expand my knowledge on further specific topics. I have found myself absorbed in the implications of technology in consulting  how big data and analytics help improve organizations' performance. I 'd like to believe I can provide a contrasting viewpoint if I devote some of my time to study and take online courses on this topic.Yet, I am an inexperienced professional and I am not sure this is the ideal action to follow. My employer has an immense background and has maintained a decent number of clients. However, he is in 70's and he has no plan of innovating or offering me some training  everything I learn is from his guidance and my involvement on the field.I like to work here because I am independent and every new project is a good opportunity to receive feedback from our clients. Still, I am not planning to settle here, so I would rather have better familiarity with today's consulting world to be ready to advance in my career.What kind of courses should I look at?  Where should I set my focus on? What further actions would you recommend? Again, thank you very much for your time.;You need to be more specific about tech in consulting or big data/analytics. In what kind of consulting? Have you heard of organizational psychology, which is the science behind HR management and uses a *lot* of data analytics and complex modeling to improve productivity and bottom line business metrics.  If that sounds at all interesting to you, if you want to stay somewhere within the HR management space but towards people analytics and data analysis/tech, feel free to reach out as I'm in an org psych grad program right now while I work in the applied science consulting field.#> Where should I set my focus on?  That is the question. Consider starting with what you have to do right now, what is under your nose. If you have some particular questions, you can write those here.

business;861zns;1521638282.0;/r/business/comments/861zns/analytics_bi_big_data_all_just_buzzwords/;Analytics, BI, Big Data.... All just buzzwords?;[deleted];"It depends on the industry. In healthcare I'd imagine the use of data can become pretty weird and twisted around. However, a company like Amazon is using data to do amazing things.  The more transactional the business the more it can be exposed to analytics. The less it is about transactions, and more about interactions with people, the less useful it becomes and can, in fact, become a hindrance.#I believe this depends on the business.  A lot of companies have a hard time implementing it but others have successfully done it.  Python is great for data analysis if you need to do a lot of data manipulation and need to combine data in different ways.  Excel can still be useful but python can take it to another level.  #these are all real things, but those terms been really watered down and probably 80% of the time are just sales buzzwords. a few companies know what they are actually doing. #As a BI professional for almost 20 years, I can tell you it's a constant challenge.  Outside of data integration (not BI work, but you always have to do it), a few of the biggest issues are: Tool panacea (this too will solve all your problems!), Lack of BI knowledge by the users (basically people don't know where to start), and lack of skill from those implementing the BI solution.    Another issue I constantly deal with is getting people to define how the business works.  You'd be surprised at how the definitions vary across the company.  Getting consensus on something like ""The Customer Tier Marketing Program"" can be a challenge, because everyone has their own interpretation as to what that program means.  Even simple calculations like Gross Margin can be challenging, because different people will calculate it differently, based on where they work.    The short answer is that most companies are shitty in relation to analytics.  However, all of them can benefit by knowing more about their data.  Just by building consensus around their terms is HUGE.  It simplifies lives and reduces organizational friction.  It can just be really tough getting there."
bigdata;88p0b6;1522564756.0;/r/bigdata/comments/88p0b6/which_is_the_most_popular_recommended_programming/;Which is the most popular / recommended programming languages for learning big data?;I would like to learn more about which is the most popular or most recommended programming languages in big data. Is this Java, or Python or R or Scala. What is the order of popularity of these languages? ;My experience is the polar opposite of /u/stevecrox0914. Scala is still the defacto standard for big data engineering basically everywhere I've seen (at least in Australia). I'm even seeing a lot of places upskilling data scientists in scala as well.  Java is used but nowhere near as much.  Python and R are the main langauges data scientists use atm.  If anything there is somewhat of a shift towards SQL as an interface to everything rather than any specific programming language.#Scala's dead, it was a good idea but the architecture approach of spark/Nifi/Hadoop made it unnecessary. The gains it provides are reduced due to the poorer bindings it gets.  Java has top support everywhere and is your software engineer choice.  Python running on Jython, is the choice of data scientists.  It depends on what you want to do.
scala;87kaqa;1522171561.0;/r/scala/comments/87kaqa/how_do_i_selfassess_my_scala_skills/;How do I self-assess my scala skills;I am a competent (fairly average) java programmer. I have been learning and using Scala for about 6 months. I work alone at the moment. I have fallen in love with Scala.So here's the thing, I can get everything I need done to work in Scala. This includes fairly complex tasks such as manipulating Spark Streaming, designing and running big data pipelines, data reduction on big data etc. BUT, I find it really difficult to assess my learning and skillset.I look at open source scala code such as Spark quite a lot. I try and think functionally, and I try and keep code as succinct as possible. Judging from open source code, even the top professionals tend to be frugal in their use of, say, implicits, currying, and other more specialist functions. At the same time, I can't help but feel that I am basically using scala as java with Option and much much better lambda functions.So what can I do to ensure that I am evaluating my code properly? I can imagine applying for a Scala job in the future and would like to be up to scratch.;"I think a good way to do this might be to hang out on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/scala/scala) and chat with other developers, go to conferences, listen to talks online, get involved in an open-source project, etc.  so you can get to know other good Scala programmers and learn how they think about things. A lot of it will come down to style and interest. I'm an ok functional programmer but would get tossed out on my ass if I tried to interview for an Akka job. Nobody is good at everything … Scala is a big language.#I'm in a similar place. I have been using Scala less than a year and have fallen in love. I recommend getting the ""red book"" and trying out some of the middle chapters when you're feeling ambitious. It helps give you a grounding on the type system and what is possible.  Finally I will say that I dislike job interviews that focus on obscure details of languages to test your knowledge. I find that language quirks can be quickly learned as needed but having an intuitive sense of how to solve problems in a given language is much more important.#The [lambdaconf ladder of functional programming](http://lambdaconf.us/downloads/documents/lambdaconf_slfp.pdf) got a lot of mockery and criticism when it came out, but I do think it's a good effort in this direction (though of course specific to one particular style of programming) of making you aware of what skills and techniques are out there that you might want to learn.#See Scala Competency Levels by Odersky: http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/8610  This kind of thing is subjective of course, but it's a good list of topics to explore.#I tell people Scala is like a swimming pool -- you don't have to dive in the deep end to learn how to swim.    Martin Odersky put together a [list](http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/8610) of Scala skills for application developers and library developers.  Generally, I'd say the learning curve of Scala are the bits not covered by Java: learning how to use functions, and then how to use implicits, and then how to use the type system.  Don't get discouraged if you don't get it all at once -- the contributors have been doing this for years and sometimes forget how long it took to wrap their heads around. #[wartremover](http://www.wartremover.org/) inspects your code a bit more deeply than scalastyle.  You can avoid more javaisms with the OptionPartial, Throw, and TryPartial rules documented here:  http://www.wartremover.org/doc/warts.html#You can use [Scalastyle](http://www.scalastyle.org/) to avoid javaisms.  For example, these rules can help you avoid `null`, `return`, `var`, and `while` in your code:        <check enabled=""true"" class=""org.scalastyle.scalariform.NullChecker"" level=""error""/>       <check enabled=""true"" class=""org.scalastyle.scalariform.ReturnChecker"" level=""error""/>       <check enabled=""true"" class=""org.scalastyle.scalariform.VarFieldChecker"" level=""error""/>       <check enabled=""true"" class=""org.scalastyle.scalariform.VarLocalChecker"" level=""error""/>       <check enabled=""true"" class=""org.scalastyle.scalariform.WhileChecker"" level=""error""/>   See also http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala for other rules you might want to apply either with scalastyle or other tools.#Just keep looking at the code behind popular Scala libraries and looking at idiomatic Scala code and it will come naturally. If you can, contribute to OSS Scala projects in small ways and benefit from the community code reviews.  Also helps to try and build hello-world or better apps using interesting scala frameworks. In no particular order:  - akka - play - cats/scalaz - finagle - algebird  Each of these give you exposure to new patterns and paradigms.  Worth noting that w.r.t Spark specifically, most of the contributors are writing (very good) Scala that looks like Java for a variety of reasons. Especially the memory management, concurrency and performance optimization code. As a result, the source code tends to be less focused on idiomatic Scala and more focused on code that works as fast and correctly as possible.#I wouldn't worry about applying for Scala jobs specifically.  Almost nobody asks in an interview if you know some specific part of a programming language.#> Judging from open source code, even the top professionals tend to be frugal in their use of, say, implicits, currying, and other more specialist functions. At the same time, I can't help but feel that I am basically using scala as java with Option and much much better lambda functions.  If you are looking at ""most"" as the spark apis, sure. That's because of the databricks style guide, which explicitly states to avoid implicits: https://github.com/databricks/scala-style-guide  Many other open source projects, such as fs2 and Monix and Play! use implicits liberally (about 1% of the sloc):  https://github.com/monix/monix -- 868 lines in main code of the word implicit out of 73946 lines of code according to sloc https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2 -- 262 lines of main code with the word implicit out of 12636 according to sloc  https://github.com/playframework/playframework - 1015 lines with the word implicit in main code out of 82585 lines according to sloc.  This is opposed to Spark (note that it is a much larger project in terms of lines of code, it hand 534707 objects in git!): 1051 occurrences of the word implicit in main code. It has 615813 lines of code according to sloc.  Note that implicit is mainly used for paramaters to functions, in monix, out of 4578 defs in main, 868 of them take implicit arguments, for example.  That's ~25% of the methods.  The thing is, unless you are writing your own applications outside of a framework, you should be following the conventions of the framework you are using. So in Spark -- use fewer implicits. In https -- yeah, probably using currying and implicits.  If you follow the convention of your framework, and can test and change things easily, you are writing quality code for your domain."

What is good about this though, is that this information can also be used for social science and medical research, and I think it really opens up some new opportunities. My partner and I are building a platform to collect this big data to be used for scholarly research. I am wondering if what type of researchers you think might be interested in this? Is this interesting to you? Would you be comfortable sharing this type of information? Or any other thoughts you might have. Thanks!;Google it? Been and being done.  Work is also being done on ethics and methods. #It can be a real bitch to cite, and depending on the source it might not be scientifically reliable (thinking of Fitbit step counts, for example  that data is always a pretty rough estimate). But it's an academic gold mine because so much goes on in the digital world.   I've used a lot of material from Facebook and Twitter for research on language change and attitudes towards language/language change. There's so much of it that you can run statistics on it, and come to some legit conclusions about things. The problem is that it's not always easy to access because of privacy considerations and in some cases even ownership rights. #Already being done - plenty of people in HCI, public health, medical informatics doing research in behavior change, improving patient experience using wearables as a data point. Check out JAMIA for articles on this sort of thing. Seems to be an expanding field with many avenues for funding, esp. with US Congress’ creation of Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute.#Commonly done in my field (audiology) already. Hearing aids have had datalogging capabilities for about a decade now, recording such parameters as hours of use, time spent using the different programs, and time spent in different acoustic environments. The recent introduction of smartphone-connected hearing aids has also opened up the option of real-time monitoring and two-way communication between the clinician and the hearing aid user via the cloud. For real-time data collection techniques, check out ecological momentary assessment (EMA) if you're not familiar with it already.#People do this in my field (human-computer interaction) all the time, and therefore also discuss the ethics of doing it all the time. Although there are already ethical standards for this kind of research, they're somewhat in flux given the rapidity of technological change. #>My partner and I are building a platform to collect this big data to be used for scholarly research.  Good luck getting that.  The companies that already collect it are not going to share it with you.  If people share it, you will need informed consent paperwork and a paper trail for every single person, and to maintain that for each set of data when people access it. That creates all sorts of additional privacy concerns.  Collection of location / health data is already raising serious red flags with respect to privacy and personal autonomy, and that's with private companies that (supposedly) anonymize the data before releasing it.  Note also that scholarly research using primary data collected from individuals *or* groups typically requires institutional review board approval.  I don't see any way that your idea could work. There are far too many hurdles. You're basically proposing to become some kind of big personal data repository. I honestly have no idea how you'd overcome all of the potential problems with privacy and data collection and availability / access.  **Note:** Researchers who collect this kind of information for their studies want the least-biased data they can get. Filtering for people only who would opt into this kind of data collection, and you'd get an extremely biased sample. I don't see how this would create useful datasets for most research.

Talk to people about what their day-to-day is like, ask about their long term career goals, and try to understand how their degree helps them reach those goals. #1. It certainly could be. There's nothing stopping most MDs from doing some for of research, particularly if they're willing to work (at least early on) on their own time. However, it can be much easier to negotiate for protected research time as an MD-PhD. In addition, getting protected time for research is only half the battle, funding for your studies is also pretty neato, and MD-PhDs have the highest rate of grant approval of any other degree holders in academia. While this is probably a chicken and the egg issue of - do MD-PhDs just better grant writers than their PhD or MD counterparts? Probably at least to a degree, since they've had experience both in the clinic and in the lab. Are study sections more likely to fund them due to some inherent positive bias? Maybe a bit. Regardless, physician scientists with the dual degree are more likely to obtain funding.  2. Again, you don't *need* a PhD for anything. However, writing grants, manuscripts, designing studies, developing hypotheses are all skills, and the extra training in a PhD program may be helpful in the future studies you might hope to conduct. It's up to you to decide if you think that that training might be necessary for you. There are, of course, opportunities to conduct research in med school and residencies, and that could be sufficient training for your needs, but there's never going to be a true replacement for hands-on experience, regardless of which path you choose to follow.  3. Most MD-PhD programs (and particularly Medical Scientist Training Programs (MSTPs) - which are specially-funded and regulated by the NIH, these programs guarantee that your tuition and fees will be paid for for the duration of school, in addition to a cost-of-living stipend) start with your first two years of medical school (the preclinical years). After you take Step 1, you choose the lab in which you choose to conduct your dissertation studies, and spend the next 3-5 years doing your research and defending your thesis. Typically, you get to do a few rotations in labs during the summer between your first and second years, which should help you decide where you want to spend the next several years doing your research. Definitely take time deciding which labs you rotate with, since they'll more-or-less be your only options when it comes time to choose a lab.  Source: am a current graduate student who works alongside several MSTP students. Feel free to ask any other questions you might have.#Just to add 2 cents. A lot of MDs who have their labs trained in times were medical school loans were SUBSTANTIALLY smaller. Nowadays it is doable, but not that easy to go for pure academic research as an MD since you have massive loans and academia gigs dont pay that much. MDPhD tuition coverage and stipend means you dont feel that pressure which i think is an immense plus.#I had a similar question. My undergraduate university has a good MD/PhD program associated with it and the administration in the MD/PhD program were more than happy to talk to me about it and connect me with current MD/PhD students. I really suggest you do this.   1. The way my counselor broke it down, an MD/PhD will give you an advantage in getting grants and will help teach you how to be a good researcher.  2. Most people doing that kind of research are typically MD/PhD, that doesn't mean you can't, it will just be more difficult. 3. Traditionally, you do your two academic years in med school, do your PhD, then come back and finish your clinical years in med school. It ends up being 8 years in most places (2 years med, 4 years grad, 2 years clinical). It depends on the institution though. You will interview with a bunch of labs you're interested in and you'll do rotations in labs in most places. If I were you, I'd start thinking about what you want to do as far as research. You have more flexibility the broader the department you want to do research in is (eg. Pitt has a ton of engineering research, so that would give you a lot of options). #Looks like others have addressed your questions pretty well. I recommend finding a few leaders in the big data field and seeing what their website bio/CV look like. Atul Butte is one that first comes to mind: http://buttelab.ucsf.edu  If you only want to do research, then pursue a PhD. If you want 80% research/20% clinic do an MD/PhD and go to school for free (2yrs pre clinical, 3-5 yrs PhD portion, 2 yrs clinical). It’s rare to find someone doing 50%/50%... from what I’ve gathered, you almost have to pick one. Financially it’s a wash because you lose 3-5 years of your future salary. If research is a minor interest, stick with the MD. 
cscareerquestions;883xe8;1522349875.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/883xe8/does_being_a_java_developer_suck_so_badly_that_i/;Does being a Java developer suck so badly, that I should never consider being one?;I've worked mostly in interpreted languages for the jobs I've had so far (Ruby on Rails, Python, Node.js), but am hoping to switch to something compiled as the jobs are perhaps more data-centric and backend-oriented. I don't particularly love Java, but it seems that most big data and or other back end jobs at bigger, more mature companies almost always use Java. I suppose the question is, is the language so awful that it should absolutely be avoided at all costs, even though a lot (maybe almost all) big and good quality companies use it? Thanks!;"What's wrong with Java?  Sure beats the others you listed.#What? No lmao. Go watch some online videos or something on how Java works to see if you like it. IMO Java is better than Python/JS because of its type system and maturity, but hey to each their own.#Java is everywhere, whether you like it or not it is helpful on a resume.#Leave Java alone#There is a reason why Java is one of the most popular languages.   If you don't like it, that's one thing but to say that it's an awful language (though it has some flaws, like every language) is just wrong.#Ruby on Rails, Python, Node.js: lucky you!  It does seem that most big data or other backend jobs use Java.  A lot of companies are stuck in the past.  You're lucky that they aren't still using Cobol!  10+-year-old companies chose Java because, back then, the non-Java web servers and web frameworks were non-existent or slow/terrible (and often had to be hacked with C++ extensions, yikes!).  Now, most non-Java languages have reasonably capable, even good, web servers and web frameworks (no C++ needed).  Servers are faster and cheaper, JIT compilers exist and the language just doesn't matter as much in terms of performance.  Database performance tends to be the bottleneck and some of the non-Java web frameworks encourage BUT DON'T REQUIRE non-scalable but easy to use database strategies.  If you forgo these non-scalable database strategies and use/build a highly scalable one and do a good job on your database schema (or whatever is used in place of a schema), Java vs non-Java is a non-issue.  But old programmers don't like to change so lots of new companies use Java.  And lots of Java pros will point out, quite correctly, that modern Java provides all of the clever features that non-Java languages have come up with.  Except that many companies don't use those clever features for various reasons (which is often because Java pros don't like to change and ""classic Java/JEE works just fine"").  I've seen several Java projects delayed or die.  That's not fair because it's not Java's fault that lots of Java devs are slow, ignore modern Java advances and construct silly and errorprone Java architectures.  Lots of new companies choose Java out of tradition or machismo (""keep your toys out of my serious business!"").  Nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM and, these days, nobody ever lost funding or got laughed at for choosing Java.  So, yes, I think that Java is used at a lot of jobs and the way that most companies use it is pretty awful but, if you want those jobs, it'd help to learn Java.  Source: I did Java for 10+ years but I don't do it anymore.#Get off your high horse and head out of your ass. If being a java developer sucked so bad then there wouldn’t be many people employed as them. #If Java were so awful, why would so many ""good quality"" companies be using it?  #Stop reading from wherever you get your language news. Stop believing every word you read/hear when someone talks about language X or framework Y.#I am sad ever time I have to use javascript wish we used gwt or vaadin. I think node.js is an abomination.  Python is pointless and tiresome. Every one has their preferences.   If you don't like java then a java job will suck. FOR YOU. Other people are very happy using java. On the other hand, you might enjoy spending some time with a grown-up language... Who knows?#I’ve never met anybody who hated java. IMO it’s object oriented ness is so heavy it makes you think OOP, plus it powers Android, and a lot of enterprise backends. "

Machine Learning is a great field! Many companies, tech and not tech, are looking into and investing heavily into ML since the influx of Data being everywhere.  The field is growing quickly and lots of smart people from different backgrounds are doing some cool work. Im very interested in the models and algorithms of ML so that is something you could look into. If you are a student then get involved in a ML lab on campus.  Good luck!#Do something in machine learning. You can probaly pick up python quick. Or use Groovy to script since it just sits on Java. Just learn something. #The typical specifications are: IT, dev ops, mobile dev, web dev, UI/UX, backend dev, data science/analytics, testing, IoT project dev, game dev, robotics  The buzz word careers are: data science/big data, machine learning/neural networks/deep learning/AI, cryptocurrency/blockchain, AR or VR, quantum computing, robotics, fintech (/r/algotrading).   Some people glamorize game dev, or whatever they're doing, whatever you think sounds cool you should try to pursue#cloud deployments and infrastructure as code#Container orchestration and data visualization are supposedly high demand skills atm. I'm not sure I'd call either interesting when stacking it up against hot tech like ML, but you can do some pretty cool shit if you know docker and kubernetes

Wellington;859dyw;1521349970.0;/r/Wellington/comments/859dyw/looking_for_it_work_in_wellington/;Looking for IT work in Wellington;"I'm going to be moving to Wellington as of 4th April and wondered if anyone had any tips for me on finding work in the IT industry in Wellington. My experience in the UK IT sector was working within a large government departments data & analytics team. I have experience in SAS, R, shell scripting and Python (much less experience than the aforementioned skills). In my previous role I did a lot of continuous improvement work on live running data services and would love to continue this kind of role or better yet develop my career further down the ""Big Data"" path.I have a bachelor's degree in Network Computing that has gave me a good foundation for picking up new tech or programming languages. In my spare time I dabble in very amateur game design/development.I'm looking to further develop my coding skills as I genuinely enjoy my work. The satisfaction of finding a resolution to an existing issue or problem is wonderful. I've already reached out to multiple recruitment agencies, have contacted some companies that people I've met on the road have mentioned and have a few ongoing enquiries. Any pointers, tips or nudges in the right direction would be appreciated. Thank you in advance for any help. ";"Hey, so I'm not employed as an analyst or anything to do with big data, but that's the avenue that I'm gunning for, so I've done a little bit of research. There seem to be lots of opportunities for this kind of thing in Wellington (hence why I'm trying to get into the field). In addition to an apparent dearth of data analysts in Wellington (or maybe even business analysts given your SAS knowledge?), all of the large government analyst groups are based here. Search for some keywords on seek.co.nz specifically in Wellington, and see what you find. [Here's an example](https://www.seek.co.nz/job/35729304) of a job listing that I was looking at earlier, which seems to suit your background. That's just one I found after literally minutes of looking.   Like I said, take my opinions with a grain of salt, because I'm only hoping to get into this field versus actually having first-hand experience - nevertheless, it seems that you could have chosen far worse parts of the world to try and get a job with your skillset.#A couple more to check out would be Flux (part of Powershop) who have a large dev team- also qrious - a venture “no longer a startup” owned by Spark is one of NZ largest analytics firms as well - good luck... plenty of ex-pat UK types here so you will be in great company.... #Public Sector is generally awash with both permament and fixed term analyst roles, and they are generally all SAS shops running on Oracle servers  so you'll need some basic SQL knowledge to join and extract data from the warehouse, but nothing too complicated.   In addition to Seek, there is also jobs.govt.nz  For the private sector, Loyalty NZ (in their LAB360 division), Xero and Trademe (although they are apparently starting to move away from SAS) are the biggest hirers.  BNZ as well assuming they haven't decided to sack everyone that week.  Contracting opportunities abound as well, I had barely 2 years experience as a data analyst fresh from uni before I was able to score my first very nice hourly rate contract.   If you do want to try recruiters, my personal experience in Wellington was that Hays (Gary Dean) and Hudson (Peter Sing) were the best, both in terms of jobs available and thier effectiveness.  Beyond Recruitment always have a good range, but found them quite slack and slow.#Not often mentioned but possibly worth a look: Stuff.co.nz (the company formerly known as Fairfax). I've been working there for the last 5 months and I quite like it. Not sure if there are any jobs posted, but we've had a few technology team members leave over the last while so there might be some openings. We're not heavy into analytics yet, but the operative word is ""yet"". There's definitely an interest for us to start moving that direction. "

I have about 1.5 years left on an F32, at the end of which I'll be done with the whole post-doc phase of my career. I've been predominantly academia track focused up until this point and a lot of the people around me feel I'd make a strong candidate when it comes time to apply.But very recently, following some very recent life events and changes, I'm giving some thought to alternative career pathways that would allow me greater flexibility in living location. Which would be jobs that could be done remotely (telecommute) and/or freelance. So far what I'm coming up with is ""consulting"" (although I'm not sure what that would entail giving my background) and, based on my strong writing interests and abilities, something like technical writing, medical writing, and/or copy editing.  I'm very much at the beginnings of my contemplation and looking around here to see if anyone has any advice or recommendations for this, resources or organizations to look into, types of jobs that a neuroscience PhD might be able to fill reasonably? I'm toying with some workshops for ""big data science"" and picking up some programming languages and brushing up on statistics, which seems it could be useful for certain types of work. I'm also considering a part-time copy editing or other writing job as an entry to the field, but need to check if there are restrictions against that in my fellowship. ";If you’re interested in science writing, there are companies that essentially translate science jargon into something the layman would be interested in (and donate $$ to essentially). One of my friends with a neuro PhD went into that and he loves it.   He got started by picking his own topics and just writing articles about them on linked in to build his portfolio as a grad student. I can’t imagine how you writing stuff like that in your free time to post on a blog or something would conflict with an F32 even if a real job would. #My husband with a PhD does statistical consultung for small startups.  I did freelance copy editing as a PhD for a while, and despite having worked as a copy editor at a publishing company previously, I hated doing it in academia.#Isn't there a repayment period for the F32 that requires you to stay in research after the grant is over?

Compare it to, say, web app dev world where you have all sorts of solutions,  some very elegant, up and down the value chain -- from lambda-style functions in the cloud to full-on web-based app dev 'frameworks' like anvil and bubble, and everything in between.am i wrong?;"Calling it ""big data' shows you don't understand it, there's no ""big data"", there are various problem where one deals with above-average requirements in terms of data size, performance or data complexity and for some reason people like to lump them into ""big data"".  Personally I think the ""big data"" environment is amazing, at least for my ""big data"", but my ""big data"" usually consists of hundreds of billions of low granularity bid logs... and the way I handle that is column stores.  If your ""big data"" consists of analyzing the text from hundreds of millions of webpages, I wouldn't recommend that as a solution, I would recommend getting a very fast statistics-focused language like Julia and finding a highly parallelizable LDA library.  Maybe you ""big data"" consists of semi-formatted data, outputs from some boxes that had 20 different log formats over the year and can contain thousands of fields and sometime it's the same name but a different meaning and data type... well, than you could go use something like ScyllaDb or Es to analyze that entanglement.  And that's just some completely different problems that fall under ""big data"" based on data type, each of those datasets could be treated in 100 different ways depending on what you want to get from it.  The ""Big data"" ecosystem is ****ing amazing, in what other fields are top-level companies open sourcing their database, languages, libraries and frameworks made specifically for this domain ?  Maybe ML... but modern ML is very intertwined with ""Big data""#> web app dev world  First off general purpose web apps have much greater scope than big data.  It isn't a remotely fair comparison.  The web in 1994 probably had more developers than big data does today certainly by 1996.  I don't think the state of big data tools is much different than the web in the mid 1990s.  A much fairer comparison would be specialized vertical technologies.  Say for example languages and tools for programming SDN.  #You're not entirely wrong, but it's unfair to say that ""big data technologies are shitty"". Big Data is a state, not a trend or whatever you think it is. A state that can vary and change, and it does so a lot. The field is growing fast and tools are getting deprecated a year after they are used in production. But it's not true to say that it's all that bad. NiFi, spark streaming, Fluentd, Kafka are just a sliver of great technologies used today, which I'm quite familiar with some, and less familiar with others. It's like saying the databases field is shitty because people are using ElasticSearch for storing sales data.#From my experience it is because most of the data scientists are not software engineers and most software engineers are not data scientists. This leads to the problem that the systems are usually sh*tty scripts being run somehow in sort of automatic way.  Also the data science and machine learning fields is progressing so fast that software.engineers.have trouble following the needs of the data scientists.  #> web app dev world where you have all sorts of solutions, some very elegant  First of all, most web app dev solutions have some kind of architectural limitation (usually scalability), and have taken literally 30 years of development to get to where they are now, from the days of writing cgi-bin scripts in C.  Also, each single component of a big data stack is usually more complex than a web framework, more like a high performance, fully featured webserver.  >  incredible complexity, low-quality or at least fragile/low-resilience software/systems/configuration, etc  There's some truth to this, but the ecosystem is evolving. In addition, it is *necessarily* fragmented, as to achieve the right type of performance and robustness, tools need to be targeted to a specific set of tradeoffs.  Finally, if you look at commercially sponsored open source offerings like elasticsearch (notably NOT a consulting company), that stuff is as professional grade as you would expect.  Incidentally, the consulting companies are partly to blame here - they create ""me too"" tools and have no incentive to make anything easy to use. #Because:     * the simplest and easiest solutions can be extremely expensive to run when you're talking about processing many billions of rows per day    * big data pipelines, complex data, and analytics are far more complex than web development    * there's still a lot of fairly new bits that are still maturing: airflow, kafka, redshit, etc    * some components are locked in vendor struggles that seem to retard progress: hadoop    * others promise the world: spark, and 80% of what's out there#A few reasons:  * There's a lot of NIH (not invented here) and companies create their own instead of improving an existing one * Big Data is [way more complex](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/on-complexity-in-big-data) than small data * These are general purpose tools and its difficult to make an easy one for all things Big Data * There's a bunch of people's PhD thesis in these projects and that code is (generally) terrible * These projects aren't that old or mature * There's a newer and better thing on the horizon and I'm going to work on that instead of improving the one I'm using now#Let's be clear-- ""Big Data"" is a fuck boy term that was introduced by some fucking dipshits fresh out of their computer science class, because they wanted to play pretend pioneer. every generation believes that they made something up, and because they call it something different than the previous name, they're the creators now. Reading and sorting information has been around for decades. Data logic is data logic, there's no spoonfeeding available to those that have no purpose in the game."

This job is full time and is aimed at recent college grads. I graduated with a  BS in Math and BS in Comp Sci. I have minimal experience and have taken 1 Database class where I learned some basic SQL and database design. The listing is basically just asking for a bachelors degree but then says after a year in this program, the candidate will essentially be promoted to one of the following: **business analyst, data engineer, or big data engineer**. I want to learn more, while i am applying, about technologies relevant to these. I feel like often times when i see job postings, I just see a large list of technologies/languages that may be specific to the company or infrastructure being used by said company. I'm not sure what are the common technologies used across most of these (**business analyst, data engineer, or big data engineer**) jobs. I find it easy to find a listing that says you need to know x,y, & z. Then I go to another listing for the same job and they say you need to know a,b,c. 1. Is there a road map or concise guide so I know what I need to learn? What common technologies and or languages are used across these professions?2. What is core to these professions and where/how can I learn them? Does anyone here have any resources that are relevant to these professions? In short I guess I'm just trying to understand exactly what I really need to learn to be successful in these jobs and what resources/road maps are available?;the tech stack is really dependent on the company, of course. speaking from experience in big data, i can tell you about some trends right now:  Languages: Python, Scala, **SQL**, Java  Tech: Hadoop (HDFS), Hive/Spark, Kafka, HBase, Impala, etc.    I recommend looking at [this free e-book](https://www.jesse-anderson.com/books/the-ultimate-guide-to-switching-careers-to-big-data/). It was a great starting point for me. If you get this job (and you decide on the engineering route), a top priority you should have is to mingle with the data engineers and ask them what tech they use, then getting familiar with those techs.  Honestly, just read that book. That guy has the right idea. Obviously he's advertising his classes, but the information in that short book is pretty high quality.#business analyst = show fancy pie charts to execs  data engineer = do manual preprocessing of data that doesn't crash your excel  big data engineer = do manual preprocessing of data that crashes your excel using super advanced tools that are way overkill and would honestly work just fine in a normal MySQL database if you bothered to configure it properly    Those names mean nothing at all. At one company you are a data analyst, at another a business analyst, at another a developer, at a third a machine learning expert while doing the EXACT same work.

TillSverige;85pujj;1521517998.0;/r/TillSverige/comments/85pujj/dreaming_of_sverige/;Dreaming of Sverige;Me 33m and my SO, 27f, with our two children 7m and 1f are looking to move to Sweden in the next ten years or so. Jobs are hard here because retail/customer service are hard to move up in. I've spent the last year trying to learn Swedish, and I know I have extended family in Jönkoping in but I haven't kept up with them.I currently work in a job much like Bisnode, big Data for companies (credit reporting, industry/financial speculation) and am feeling discouraged. She wants to homestead and live mostly a farm-type life with livestock and gardening while I want to work, but I'm not skilled and have no degree outside of completing all of high school (grade 12) and some University. I am very fit and strong as we live and work on a farm here in Texas as well as our regular desk jobs.Do we have a chance if we look for jobs online? I'm worried that Sverige is not very farming-friendly and she won't be able to fulfill her dreams. We want to live in Sweden as it seems, based on all of what we've learned iver the years, that we'd fit better there socially than in most places here in the US.Any advice, constructive or dissuasive, is welcome. Tack på förhand!;"Can't give you any pointers on finding a job but farming is my jam.   First off, sweden is a pretty big country and the type off agricultural you will be doing will depend on share you end up.  Southern sweden will give you more oppurtunity and yield larger harvests.     Keeping livestock is something you can do no matter where you end up however.    First thing to keep in mind when keeping livestock in Sweden is the high standard of animal welfare laws. If you have little experience with farming and want a good place to start at, pigs are the way to go.  Pigs can be raised almost anywhere, they are easy to care for and yield allt of meat compared to the work you put in.     First thing to do is to read up and the laws concering farming here in Sweden.    If you have any questions about the laws feel free to pm me.#Don't know any specifics regarding your area of expertise, but in general high-tech specialists are fairly sought after.   Degrees (or lack thereof) only really tends to matter when you're looking for you first job (which specialist jobs rarely are). But after that it's all about previous work, so if you got good references from your current employer that can go a long way.  Your biggest issue will probably be finding a company willing to set up an interview with you, you being on the other side of the globe and all. And you *need* to have the job landed before you move here. It's a criteria for getting a work visa.   You can't come here on a tourist visa and start looking for a job. That'll get you kicked out as far as I understand.   So start job hunting first, think of the the rest later is my advice.   Another issue might be if you also need to find an employer who's willing to let you work remotely. Big data tends to mean high info security, meaning work on site only. Can perhaps be hard to combine with homesteading. Not impossible, but might cut down your job opportunities.   For programmer/IT/high-tech jobs in general working remotely is often acceptable, as long as you can come in to the office every so often. Varies greatly between companies though. Make sure you got that cleared before you accept a job (if you are going the homesteading route that is).  On the topic of homesteading, please be aware that we're quite far north up here, the winters are long and the growing season short. It takes some skill. And it takes *a lot of time*, so I imagine it'll be quite a challenge to combine with full-time employment.   But then again, I'm no homesteader so I'm not really an authority on that.    [Here's a good Swedish homesteading channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7GkLSNBmds1DZit_oHk-Fg) you can check out to get a better idea if what's ahead of you if you choose that path.#Hello! I'm glad you want to move here! :)  This is just my experiences growing up on the countryside, so take it with a grain of salt.  Farming is currently in a pretty rapid decline in Sweden, compared to just 60 years ago. This is because of a number of reasons. Competing markets in the EU, the cost of staying on top of all rules and regulations, low prices on produce, etc.  Small towns are experiencing a ""youth drain"" where a lot of young people are moving to the city (like me), leaving the towns with mostly old people and families.  BUT  This means that property and land is cheaper than ever in the rural areas. And the communities there are often very welcoming. Farms are also eligable for a lot of EU grants that help out a lot when it comes to money. I've seen some ""amish"" farms that seem pretty viable, and some farms focus on B&B and café-style models with local produce. It's not going to be easy at first, but certainly not impossible.   One option is to live close to a city, and drive to work, but have small farm too. You Texans seem to drive like 3 hours just to get some groceries, and then back again, so a little commute is probably not a big deal.   Something to be aware of is the winter.  You wrote that you're from Texas. Well, up here we get lots and lots and lots of snow. And if you live on a farm/rural area, you have to shovel it away to even be able to take the car anywhere. Also, the darkness is crushing. 4-5 hours of sunlight a day can really get to you if you're not prepared.  I hope this helped, and ask away if you have any questions. I can check with my family how the financial situation looks out there with farming in mind.#Your safest and most likely option is for one of you two to study a Master's degree in Sweden and apply to bring the family with you. That information can be found on migrationsverket.se. I am a student in Sweden from Minnesota. Because I don't have any special skills or IT skills, this is the only plausible way I can get into Sweden before finding a job. Otherwise, it is true. You cannot come to Sweden to job search. However with a student permit, you may work and find a job that will offer you a work visa. If you find a work visa within 6 months of graduating school, you can stay as long as your work visa is valid (as long as you have work). All that information is on migrationsverket.se"

The goal isn't to convince SJWs their views are insane (imo), nor it should be. The goal should be to convince other people they are, by being a somewhat of a reasonable person, arguing for reasonable points, and demonstrating why theirs aren't. There's some issue with that, and it's a question how much of it will work, but still.  As for SJWs in general, hypocrisy =/= different values. For example, ""White privilege"" is quite racist, and ""male privilege"" is quite sexist, neither are actually true. But same people go ape-shit over, say, someone saying the ""no-no"" word, or ""sexist"" jokes, or for example - something I just saw on Twitter - being afraid for your safety. So, there's this person, he's in an alley. A woman sees him, becomes afraid, and starts running.

conspiracy;85snyk;1521552220.0;/r/conspiracy/comments/85snyk/when_operations_like_cambridge_analytica_was/;When operations like Cambridge Analytica was considered smart campaigning.;[How Obama’s Team Used Big Data to Rally Voters](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/509026/how-obamas-team-used-big-data-to-rally-voters/)> In the 2008 presidential election, Obama’s targeters had assigned every voter in the country a pair of scores based on the probability that the individual would perform two distinct actions that mattered to the campaign: casting a ballot and supporting Obama. These scores were derived from an unprecedented volume of ongoing survey work. For each battleground state every week, the campaign’s call centers conducted 5,000 to 10,000 so-called short-form interviews that quickly gauged a voter’s preferences, and 1,000 interviews in a long-form version that was more like a traditional poll. To derive individual-level predictions, algorithms trawled for patterns between these opinions and the data points the campaign had assembled for every voter—as many as one thousand variables each, drawn from voter registration records, consumer data warehouses, and past campaign contacts.[How the Obama campaign won the race for voter data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-obama-campaign-won-the-race-for-voter-data/2013/07/28/ad32c7b4-ee4e-11e2-a1f9-ea873b7e0424_story.html?utm_term=.7e0cc2313daa)> Early in 2011, some Obama operatives visited Facebook, where executives were encouraging them to spend some of the campaign’s advertising money with the company. “We started saying, ‘Okay, that’s nice if we just advertise,’ ” Messina said. “But what if we could build a piece of software that tracked all this and allowed you to match your friends on Facebook with our lists, and we said to you, ‘Okay, so-and-so is a friend of yours, we think he’s unregistered, why don’t you go get him to register?’ Or ‘So-and-so is a friend of yours, we think he’s undecided. Why don’t you get him to be decided?’ And we only gave you a discrete number of friends. That turned out to be millions of dollars and a year of our lives. It was incredibly complex to do.” What a difference a few years can make! What was once considered smart campaigning has morphed into something illegal. I wonder what changed the perception of the press? ;No one said that was illegal. But, I'm pretty sure entrapping and blackmailing people is illegal. #A lot changed technically between 2008 and 2015 and what CA was able to do went way deeper. Also there is the whole fake news influx that wouldn't have been as effective if they never had the data from CA. Not to mention the other underhanded shit they admitted to in these videos, more of which is about to be revealed in coming days.   The next step in political influence is definitely what CA and companies like it are doing, and you can be sure the other side is going to be using that cutting edge tech as well.   The difference going forward will be disclosure of how the data is used. They'll just put it in the terms of use and keep doing what they're doing. #CA damage control crew in full effect today.#Its a disgusting tactic and its shameful that we've accepted this as the status quo.

ITCareerQuestions;89pfc8;1522848372.0;/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/89pfc8/is_a_masters_in_it_worth_it/;Is a masters in IT worth it?;I already have 7 years work experience as a reporting/BI/database analyst with a BBA from a state school. My goal is to become a fully fledged business intelligence/data/big data engineer, as my passion is anything related to data and databases (relational and otherwise).My original plan was to supplement my BBA with certifications from the local community college in database development to show that I have the technical skill. That plan fell through since the scheduling won't ever work while working FT. The only credible option I've found is a masters in IT that focuses on BI/DB development along with some big data courses. My other option is to learn as much as I can through MOOCs and continue working on vendor certs. Obviously this will be cheaper but not near as credible. Couple other things:1.) Cost of the masters will be 28K2.) Already have $22K in debt for my BBA3.) Masters includes a litany of courses that I am very interested in. Almost no fluff. 4.) School is actually pretty well regarded in the metroplex I live in. 5.) I have a wife, toddler, and a mortgage. So doing any drastic or risky moves is out of range for now. 6.) Employer will not pay for any of the masters (small healthcare company). I'm also afraid I'm competing in a well saturated field, so it makes me wonder about the ROI on the masters degree. What should I do?;I don't think it's going to be worth the ROI, especially if you are hesitant to move around. Experience is going to be more valuable than education is, and while it might help you move up a bit quicker... I can't imagine that it will be easy to juggle that while working and having a little one.#Rule of thumbs here   1.  Any masters that isn't a top 10 should be paid for by your company so you aren't worried about ROI.  2.  You get a masters when you're told you need one to move up  If you're looking for additional items to throw on to your resume look at [edX](https://www.edx.org) and the micromasters / cert programs. They're cheaper, faster, and respected. #>My other option is to learn as much as I can through MOOCs and continue working on vendor certs. Obviously this will be cheaper but not near as credible.   What leads you to believe this is the case?   MOOCs/Vendor certs tend to be more up-to-date in terms of content and industry direction. Frankly, previous working experience in $technology is going to trump either the MBA or a MOOC either way, so why pay more?  #Here is my 2 cents, I am no analyst but it seems to me like the amount of debt you will put yourself in with going after a masters and no increase in salary or is there?   If a company is asking for it and you plan to most likely get a  raise then id say maaaybe. Perhaps a potential employer is willing to pay for the masters...in that case then I wouls day go for it.   If expereince will outweigh the masters degree then don't do it. Experience is key.

Normally, with a typical user, with a singular hard drive, having an unrecoverable read error just means whatever was in that sector is now gone and the file is corrupted/bit rotted away. Why is it here, with the same level of data corruption, the rebuild cannot continue due to one failure that your standard user might not even notice with unimportant, resilient or rarely accessed files?Despite the rant about pretentious pseudo-intellectual dick swinging at the start of this post, I wont pretend my data dick is terabytes big or spans multiple locations with 3 iterations, but Il give my layman's theory just so perhaps potential big data swingers might have an idea of the type of answer/level of detail Im looking for (its really closer to eli5 than a complex introduction to the inner workings of raid magic/alchemy).My ill informed theory: Due to the way raid rebuilds (constructed through magic assortments of secret data pheromones spread cross the fields of your data land), one ure means that the rest of the data rebuilt after that will be off, breaking the pattern similarly to a building without a foundation rather than missing I frame in those *linux iso* videos you keep on your secondary nas.Anyhow, hopefully this was entertaining enough a read to warrant trying to process the question into one that makes sense and actually uses the correct terminology and then the will to formulate a response that isnt a colourful rendition of the gospel of 3-2-1. Thanks in advance.";">Why cant raid5 rebuild upon discovery of a URE  It can and does.  It depends on the specific implementation, but some will just lose 1 stripe and continue on with the rebuild.  There is nothing secret or magic about his RAID 5 works.  It's just the XOR operator.  0 XOR 0 = 0   0 XOR 1 = 1   1 XOR 0 = 1   1 XOR 1 = 0    So if you have a disk and the bits go like this:  11001...  And disk 2, the bits go like:  00111...  Then you calculate parity like:  11110...  So if you delete any of the 3 disks, you can recreate it by just doing the XOR operator on the 2 that remain, and the result will be the missing one.#>Why cant raid5 rebuild upon discovery of a URE on a technical level?

Rebuild time might take a while. Though I personally don't think it's a big issue for a private media box. You can still watch movies and download torrents while the rebuild happens.  Oh, and also because of that one CNET article from 2005 :))))))#We've been able to rebuild a RAID5 through URE for at least a decade now.  The original problem was lazy programmers who won't give us a ""continue"" option.  Now pretty much all SW and HW RAID lets you plot through a RAID5 rebuild.  You'll just end up with a stripe of bad data.#RAID-5 (or, more generally, parity-based RAID) can, by its nature, recover from up to P of the N+P disks involved reporting an error on a given stripe. (For RAID-5, P=1, RAID-6 P=2, and then N+P=number of disks, more or less.)  There are at least two caveats, though.  * Not all errors are going to be explicitly reported errors - some sufficiently bad drives may return data that is not the data you thought you wrote out to them, without throwing an error, and if the RAID implementation doesn't have some way of figuring out which disks are ""right"" and which are ""wrong"" (say, checksums on the blocks on each drive in a stripe), it can't necessarily figure out which drives told it something incorrect, just that something is wrong. (And that's assuming the RAID implementation even checks the parity parts of a stripe on reads where there's not an explicit error reported by the drive  if it doesn't check, it definitely won't know.)  (In theory, all hard drives and SSDs have checksums and more complicated encodings underneath what you see as the actual data you wrote out to the disk in order to detect+correct getting a single bit wrong in a read, for example, but I've encountered hard drives that were bad at this before in the wild  you could also simulate this by just writing random bytes to parts of the raw disks underneath the RAID.)  * Disk density has grown much faster than disk throughput or disk reliability, so unless you're doing periodic ""patrol reads"" (or patrol scrubs, for ZFS, or whatever your RAID implementation du jour calls them) to actually try reading all the stuff on-disk regularly, you're likely to run into parts of a disk that have read errors that you didn't notice before doing a rebuild because the data wasn't looked at. (In addition, the amount of time it takes to do a rebuild, and thus the window in which you're operating at reduced redundancy, is naively upper bounded by [data on disk] / [throughput of single disk's writes], and since disk throughput has grown much slower than density, that window keeps widening.)"

I'm really looking for anything right now, but I'd prefer data on junior players since I want to play around with machine learning and prospects.I have access to EliteProspects' API, but that only lists G, A, PIM, and +/- for players, not SOG or anything else.;CorsiCa. Best data set out there#Data on the Junior players is very limited. To be honest data from most leagues is really bad compared to the NHL. Most sites I've seen with these data have roughly what EliteProspects has.  For NHL stuff http://www.corsica.hockey/ is pretty boss as /u/Buskea22 said. You may want to scrape your own if you're looking for all the data possibe.   If you're wanting massive amounts of data in one go https://github.com/icambridge/hockeystats/tree/master/stats/player has all the players in the NHL and more from 5 months ago. With some badlly written code to allow you to scrape again. #[Flick through this rack](http://www.hockeyabstract.com/thoughts/completelistofhockeyanalyticsdataresources)#Why not use the NHL api? /u/syini666 [did a great job in creating documentation for it on Github](https://github.com/dword4/nhlapi).

A lot of the basic concepts have been around as long as digital data has. But still, there is a large focus on collecting and using data in industries that haven't traditionally done so. It seems to me that it breaks down in to two areas: storage/access and analysis. I work with distributed storage systems and their component parts - S3, ELK stack, etc. - but not much on the actual use and manipulation of the data to solve business problems. We have a programmer on staff that does the latter. That's similar to what I see in other small-to-midmarket operations - The sysadmin/infrastructure folks end up learning how to build and maintain ""big data"" systems and the programmers learn what their users need from that data and how to manipulate it for that purpose.  If you were getting in to the field, one of those two paths might make sense and would leave a lot of other opportunities open along the way. On the analytics side, there's tons of resources out there for relevant skills, lists of popular apps to learn, etc. but a big complaint I hear about is the lack of *actual mathematicians/statisticians* in the field.#It's mostly statistics.

artificial;89mpg6;1522819453.0;/r/artificial/comments/89mpg6/are_there_less_data_intensive_ai_approaches/;Are there less data intensive AI approaches?;In the last few years, with the advent of big data and cloud, the world seems to be moving towards a data driven model. And all forms of Artificial Intelligence we see, comes from training on huge data sets before it can be put to use(correct me if I am wrong). So my question is, is this vast amount of training data a pre requisite for all AI approaches, or there are approaches which don't need such huge data. If yes, how effective are those and please point me to the research in those areas.P.S. I am a beginner only in the field of AI with not much know how. Please excuse if question sounds naive.;"Yes, AI long predates the big data explosion and there are plenty of models that do not require training on data to work. Basically any non-learning approach has no need or use for training data, since it doesn't change.  Search problems (and those that can be converted to search, like logical theorem proving) often do not need a learning approach, algorithms like Simulated Annealing, Hill Climbing, A*, or even Depth First Search (and it's variants) can often solve these kinds of problems just fine. The obvious example being pathfinding for NPCs in games, which really don't make sense as a learning agent, they just need to find a path to get from point A to B.#Outside of machine learning (ML) but still under the umbrella of AI, there are many methods that don't really require any data because they don't learn (see chatterbox's post). Instead, they tend to have (domain) knowledge coded into them by humans.  Within the ML domain there are also a wide variety of methods that vary in how much data they need. Look for methods that are ""sample-efficient"", ""data-efficient"" or ""small data"". Most methods are more efficient than (most) deep learning, but it seems linear methods, SVMs and ensemble methods get mentioned especially often when I search for this. You can also look at methods for ""zero-shot"", ""one-shot"" or ""few-shot"" learning, but in my experience these tend to be semi-supervised methods that still require a lot of unlabeled data (but not that many labels), so I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for.#Maybe [this](https://en.chessbase.com/post/challenging-studies-automatically)?#Maybe not what you are after, but transfer learning can dramatically reduce the amount of training data needed for a particular task."

Halp?;"I recently re-acquired a 95-96 Squier strat I owned for about 10 years after parting with it for a few years. The intonation was awful. I tried adjusting it myself, but I ran out of screw and the 6th string, 12th fret was still 1/4 of the way to an F.I took it in to a Guitar Center and asked the tech to take a look. He acknowledged that the intonation was really bad and also noted that there were some wiring issues. The volume knob doesn't work (it's stuck at max), the tone knobs don't work, and the pickup selector is borked. He then offered to trade me a Peavey Raptor that he's repaired and modified. Here's what he said about what he's done to it:""It had a broken spot on the body where the tremolo meets the body so I had to glue that back down, completely rewired, set up, and converted to a hardtail, which I would recommend keeping like that being that it was repaired there. I also have some better pickups I could give you, and then put in later for free (outside of [Major Guitar Retailer]) if you want to change out but I'd listen to these first because it does sound pretty good. The other pickups are alnico. I can modify it at that time as well if you'd like again at no charge.""He said he wants my guitar 'cause he doesn't have one of this type, he likes the color, and he has the parts to replace it so he wouldn't have to spend any money on it.At the surface, it seems like a fine deal. Trade a half-broken guitar for a working one. I know Peavey's are lower quality than Squiers, but I'm not sure how much it matters at this point?Anywho, I'm going to see and play it tomorrow, so that's obviously a big data point to consider. I'm also considering just fixing my Squier. I've never done guitar repair before, but I'm generally pretty handy. I do most of my own household and car repairs. I know basic soldering. So, two questions:* If I decide to trade, am I missing something huge here? Obviously if it sounds awful or doesn't work, that's a no. But I'm not sure what to look for other than just how it sounds and if the knobs/switches works.* Am I crazy for considering on fixing it myself? Any advice here would be greatly appreciated!*Note: I'm super broke right now and could barely afford the $50 for the intonation fix, so ""save up for a better one"" isn't really an option for me right now.";"While it's not a sought after brand, Peavey make good guitars. I have an older Peavey Predator that has one of the slickest necks I've played on.#Assuming that the new guitar is fully functional and will intonate, why wouldn't you take it? #A 20-year-old busted up squire is really not worth very much, so the worst case here is that you're losing $50 in exchange value or so. It really doesn't sound like he's trying to rip you off, though.   Play the other guitar. Do you like it? Is it going to inspire you to pick up and play the guitar?   Then go for it.   If you pick it up and the guitar just doesn't speak to you, then don't. #I say go try it out, see how it feels, and go from there. If you like it, might as well if you ask me. Theres nothing ever really 'bad' about a guitar unless its broken or extremely poorly made, the one i painted myself is a cheap ltd beginner model, barely cost me $150, and it feels almost like my most expensive guitar.#Electronics are just about the easiest thing to fix when it comes to electric guitars.  You have basic soldering skills, so honestly you could probably completely re-wire your strat in about half an hour. You'd need to shell out about $15-20 for a new set of potentiometers and a switch, but that's about it.  The tech *was* able to fix the intonation issue eventually right? So all you're dealing with is the electronics issue?  I'd 100% recommend trying to fix it yourself over trading it for a guitar with a structural repair.  I'd never consider a guitar with wonky electronics ""broken"". Electronics issues are always fixable. On the other hand, a guitar that was cracked, glued back together and is recommended to only be used as a hardtail... that's ""broken"". I'm sure the guy did a good job with the repair, but when it comes down to two guitars of about equal value, I'd always stick with the one with less damage.#A lot of tone/vol pot issues can be fixed with a good spray of switch cleaner, and sticky ones often respond to a bit of WD40 where the shaft goes into the body of the pot. #One way to look at it is, which one could you sell if you needed to? A repaired Peavey may not bring much in terms of sale price, but any guitar that can be played will bring more than a broken Squier. "

But there isn’t a very active data pipeline subreddit that I’m aware of.I am looking for suggestions on how to avoid a script soup mess to setup a pipeline to send files down through a processing. Unstructured files in my case are binary files which in this case are proprietary CAD files.pipeline.A 30k foot view currently.The CAD files are in a PostgreSQL database that have table references to all the metadata and a file pointer to the actual file on the file system. What this pipeline needs to do is:1. Read each record and do a conversion to a standard (non proprietary) format (we already have a tool to do the actual conversion of the file).2. Insert a record into another table with references to the part on the FS along with all of its metadata (filename, hash, log of conversion etc.)3. Take each record from part and do CAD extraction on the data (again tools already built to do this extraction of the data we want it just needs to be called through the pipeline).4. Insert the extracted data into the database (keeping references all intact through the process).5. Lots of other extraction/conversion/calculations...that I won't go into. Once I can get an architecture/pattern working, I feel adding on to this will be fairly trivial.We are doing all of this in Python and unfortunately has to be on Windows.I built a pipeline with Luigi to do the conversion before we had the database and it worked, but after about 5-10k tasks it started to choke under its own weight. Once we started putting the metadata and stuff into the database I figured out that its a LOT harder writing tasks with Luigi when dealing with the database.I don't think NiFi gives me any benefit. Would something like Kafka provide the structure for a pipeline of what I'm wanting? After reading about it, but seems like I could still end up with a bit of script soup potentially?For example I was thinking something for step 1) have a producer sending each record to a Kafka ""step 1 topic"". On the other end, I could have a python script (could there be something used in place to manage these scripts?) as the consumer reading the topic and processing each one as it hits the queue? At that point just sending messages and having producers and consumers processing items as each their respective topics.Would there be a better way of doing this? Managing this? ";All but the windows part I think is a really good fit for Xcalar.   Where are the CAD files / postgres database stored?   I don't think Kafka will help you, this seems like a batch job, not a stream. PM me if you want to talk about It. #Take a deeper look at Apache NiFi.  It should be able to handle your use case.  There is the ability to run python code in a processor, if there is custom tasks not handled by the built in processors.#Silly question, but is there a reason that keeps the work from being split up and batched? Does one part of the work require access to all of it? or can you just break up the task and restart/clear the memory at certain points? Interesting problem, thanks for posting.

sysadmin;85zgt0;1521606999.0;/r/sysadmin/comments/85zgt0/so_many_options_so_little_experience/;So many options.. so little experience;Hello all,New sysadmin here at a 250 person financial company. I’m looking into moving non-mission critical workloads to Azure, AWS, or Google, and was hoping to draw on the expertise here.My requirements are simple in the sense that I am only wanting to build small/medium VMs at the best price per GB/cpu/RAM. I am not looking to build or deploy custom code, cloud databases, machine learning, or big data.After my initial research, Google is winning. Their flexibility and available options for storage are incredibly attractive (high HDD performance per instance, 64 TB persistent disks, multi reader mounting) and the price paid for compute looks to be better than the competition. The option for VPN also appears to be 1-2 times faster than what is offered by the competition. However, the Windows licensing pricing seems immensely high compared to Azure and I have no clue why.AWS is the big kid on the block and has a huge suite of offerings and great support/KB, but they seem to nickel and dime you for every little thing and have a complex pricing structure. Windows pricing is also higher compared to Azure. The performance of disk appears to be much lower than google and marginally less than Azure if memory serves. Azure is nice as we have an EA and they roll in SQL/Windows licensing into their monthly rates. Their storage offerings are limited in terms of managed disks and the baseline performance is less than Google. Azure also looks to make every last penny off of the customer as they can with micro-billings. Azure does have some sweet benefits in terms of backup and their archive storage pricing is much less than the competition. Some background: my on-prem infrastructure runs exclusively on a flash SAN. The workloads I want to move are a mixture of file archives and email archives that are infrequently accessed, but still accessed several times daily. This also includes several database servers. We have no option for cheaper storage so I want to give that storage back to the mission critical servers and services.There’s so many factors, and it’s making it hard to pick. Has anyone done a thorough cross comparison from the compute/storage aspect and come to any conclusions? Tl dr - wanting to move to Google, Azure, or AWS. Lots of options and not sure if I’m missing something. Google appears to be winning.Thanks in advance!;AWS pricing is really complicated but if a VPS fits in your requirements you may use Lightsail and you'll have a fixed monthly fee.#At such a small scale, and given that you will still have in house hardware, I would be very surprised if putting a few services in the cloud makes any sense.  Both from a financial and from a technical point of view.  What problem or you trying to solve?#Only pay for compute cycles if you really need them. If you used each platform's native database service, you wouldn't need the VM (and thus the 24/7 compute bill). Each platform should also have simple storage that can be nearline.   I think you owe yourself the opportunity to learn what you can do with the platform tools  building VMs is a bit dated approach.#All of the cloud options are geared towards pretending to care about you while fleecing you for the maximum amount of money that they can.

Data storage could benefit from infrequent reads (cold storage), heavy and continued writes (redshift databases) and large disk space (Amazon EBS).  Computing doesn't need persistent disk space, but lots of RAM and compute resources where data storage doesn't.  Buying one resource that has all of that may conflict with another (trying to write all the time, and compute) but in this case you can do batch reads and compute seperately. #In the old days of High Performance Computing you would separate compute and storage.  This reduced the storage overhead of duplicating data. This worked best for datasets that could fit in memory.  Hadoop changed the paradigm by moving the compute resource to the data.  This works great for giant datasets that would be prohibitive to move over a LAN to the compute nodes.  Although the amount of storage space increased... but storage is cheap.  Now the pendulum is swinging back toward separation with very fast network fabric and GPU computing becoming more prevalent.#You can scale each independently according to the needs of the workload#Decoupling storage from compute allows you to treat your compute infrastructure as completely ephemeral.  Leave storage to highly available services such as S3, and spawn compute infrastructure via configuration management tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc).   Then your only question re: storage/IO comes down to how much disk you need available for staging/shuffle.

india;89bg1t;1522743367.0;/r/india/comments/89bg1t/data_or_neta_why_big_data_is_of_little_use_when/;Data or neta: Why big data is of little use when it comes to elections in India;;^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.    ______  **Data or neta: Why big data is of little use when it comes to elections in India**    ______  So, if we are to believe loud political rhetoric and even louder news television programmes, some people, including ‘foreigners’, armed with ‘sophisticated digital technology’ have subverted and/or will subvert India’s democracy.  Rubbish. The big data/subverted  elections  claim is as fundamentally flawed as Congress’ and other Opposition parties’ claim on rigged electronic voting machines (EVMs). Let’s rescue some key facts from the blizzard of political and media sound bites.  First, the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica (CA) controversy is about user privacy and dodgy ways of collecting personal data. That’s a matter of policy regulation, not electoral process. Whether tech giants that depend on advertising revenue generated by loose privacy controls can find another business model, if regulation makes data hoovering tough, is a crucial question. But that’s not related directly to elections.  Second, if firms such as CA are, indeed, willing to provide cash and other equally attractive inducements to subvert elections in various countries, that’s not a matter of big data, but old-fashioned election corruption. Outfits that don’t use data analytics are also guilty of such practices.  Third, fake news riding on social media networks owned by tech companies that want news-driven advertising but don’t want editorial responsibility is also a problem, a big one. But that, again, isn’t directly and solely an election process problem. It is another, larger regulation issue for tech giants to face up to.  Fourth, and related to third: are we seriously going to argue that before social media, election campaigns didn’t see dodgy, dangerous untruths being peddled as facts? And that voters are so gullible that rubbish circulating on Facebook and  WhatsApp  groups will mostly determine voting decisions? Now, with these facts rescued from fake views, one major question remains: is micro-targeting and voter profiling through data analytics wrong, in the sense that it delegitimises voterdecision-making? Answer: absolutely not. Here’s why.  **The Tools of the Tirade**  First, ours is an electoral democracy where caste, religion, regional and linguistic identity, and urban-rural divide have always been key inputs for campaign strategy. So, the difference between mohalla speeches that target a small subset of voters and targeted messages created by data analytics is a matter of different tools, not morality.  What’s the difference between reaching out to Rajputs through Whats-App or a small jansabha? The former is, possibly, more efficient as a messaging tool.  Second, that modern data tools can help isolate voters or individuals for very specific messages matters much less than critics will have you believe. US critics of data analytics have given examples of how social media campaigns helped political parties or lobby groups tailor messages for voters in small areas, or decide which venue in a locality would be better for a campaign rally.  Examples have been cited where social media preferences can be analysedto predict a voter’s political leaning and ethnicity. Much hand-wringing has also happened over the fact that in social media, users can’t see views contrary to their own once the platform learns enough and starts providing tailored content. All this, apparently, is subverting voter choice.  That’s an extraordinary claim to make. It assumes that the voter in any modern democracy is a helpless wretch who can’t access any other source of information other than what he gets from tailored content in social media.  If you spend 50 minutes a day on a social media platform, you apparently are unable to remember that there are multiple information sources, many offering views different from your own, you can access. Or, if you look at campaign messages targeted at you while posting vacation photos, you apparently are robbed of basic powers of thought. This silly assumption is at the heart of the big dataelections scare.  And it’s worse than a silly assumption when you consider the most basic fact of elections: no party wins a poll solely, or mostly, on the basis of the technological efficiency of its messaging. So, our third and last argument is that big data by itself can never swing a verdict and, therefore, it can’t subvert voter choice.  Why did BJP win in 2014 general elections? Because in  Narendra Modi  voters saw a viable alternative to Congress’ apparent governance drift. But we in the mainstream media were also guilty of making heroes out of data managers. We were taken in by their novelty.  However, those data managers and tech and management grads working in war rooms were simply spreading a message. Data analytics didn’t create the Modi wave. Political circumstances did. The medium was not the message. The message was the message.  **A Shah &amp  a Modifier   **  BJP subsequently lost Delhi and Bihar and swept in UP. BJP’s data use proficiency didn’t dip when fighting Delhi and  Bihar assembly elections  . And the once much-talked about data manager who worked for BJP in 2014 and for JD(U) in Bihar was plying his trade for  Congress  in UP.  What does this mean? Minus Modi and  Amit Shah  , two formidable politicians who have transformed the party’s election- fighting ethos, BJP wouldn’t have won so many elections. Without a clever alliance between Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav, two veteran and wily Bihar leaders, JD(U)-RJD wouldn’t have defeated BJP in the state.  So, big data can’t subvert elections. Because the role of neta is far, far more important than the role of data.     ______   ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.

Is there any chance to switch to gamedev without starting my career from the scratch?;Hello reddit,Right now I'm working as a business analyst for 3 years in a bank, and I really want to quit.Here are some concerns I have:Problem #1: I have no idea what I could do in gamedev since I’m not quite sure if business analysts are actually needed in this area. I know that several companies are looking for data analysts and I actually have masters degree in big data, but it was a while ago and I don’t quite remember anything except for general definitions and code languages’ names. Also I really can't lower my income and start as an intern. I'm open to learning new stuff tho.Problem #2: I live in Russia and I doubt any employee outside of Russia would be interested in me if i’m not a developer lol. Meanwhile, Riot Games (my current dream) has 0 open vacancies in Russia. Do companies hire analysts from abroad if they don’t have resident permit?Another option I’m looking for is working in tech support related area in gaming companies since I have some working experience as 2nd-3rd line support in the past. However, the same problems are relevant in this case (again).Did anyone experience such transition?;I know this probably isn't the best option but many dedicated server hosts hire remote support staff. That could potentially be a gateway since those servers are generally used for games such as Minecraft, Battlefield, etc. #They need QA analysts and shit.   I wish I had better advice but those are low level roles in gaming. That and - hell, those people need data analysts too. Esp. in something like Tableau (at least in the U.S.).

We have many data analytics classes but the focus is from the view of the manager.  The courses are designed to teach you how to interpret analysis done by data scientists and how to manage a data scientist or data analyst.  The courses are not designed to teach you how to code in r.  Our courses use a watered down SAS version to teach us the fundamentals and how to ask the right questions.  Frankly, you go do a masters in data science to become a data scientist. You go do an mba to make business decisions using data reports given to you.    I would look into MIT or Stanford’s courses as they may be more analytics heavy.  However, I don’t imagine the coursework being super in the weeds.

If my data in column F is blank I would like to automatically populate Worksheet 2 with the rows that are blank.   Ideally I only want a select few columns to populate over to Worksheet 2.    Let's say A,B,D,E as an example.  The idea would be that if Column F is blank I'm missing testing on a weld, and I need to contract out the testing.    Columns ABDE are the data my contractor needs to do his work.  Extra columns would be clutter on a report to him. Basically I'm building a printable report if some cells are blank. Thanks!;Something like this in A1 of Sheet2. Enter as array formula (control shift enter)       =index(Sheet1!$A$1:$Z$9999,small(if(isblank(Sheet1!$F$1:$F$9999),row(a$1:a$9999)),row(a1)),1)  Now drag that to the right 4 cells. Adjust the 1 to give you the columns you want (remember control shift enter). In your example it'd be 1,2,4,5.  Now drag down. You might want to wrap it in IFERROR to make it blank when it's done. Let me know if there are issues, typed on phone so there might be mistakes.

But as of now, all three systems are immature and very far from that limit. Substantial efficiency improvements to either of those systems (when applied to a specific use case) are possible in a matter of a few engineer-months of work. I don’t recommend to compare performance of the subject systems at all, choose the one which source code you are able to understand and modify, or in which you want to invest.  > Among those three systems, ClickHouse stands a little apart from Druid and Pinot, while the latter two are almost identical, they are pretty much two independently developed implementations of exactly the same system.  > ClickHouse more resembles “traditional” databases like PostgreSQL. A single-node installation of ClickHouse is possible. On small scale (less than 1 TB of memory, less than 100 CPU cores) ClickHouse is much more interesting than Druid or Pinot, if you still want to compare with them, because ClickHouse is simpler and has less moving parts and services. I would say that it competes with InfluxDB or Prometheus on this scale, rather than with Druid or Pinot.  > Druid and Pinot more resemble other Big Data systems in the Hadoop ecosystem. They retain “self-driving” properties even on very large scale (more than 500 nodes), while ClickHouse requires a lot of attention of professional SREs. Also, Druid and Pinot are in the better position to optimize for infrastructure costs of large clusters, and better suited for the cloud environments, than ClickHouse.  > The only sustainable difference between Druid and Pinot is that Pinot depends on Helix framework and going to continue to depend on ZooKeeper, while Druid could move away from the dependency on ZooKeeper. On the other hand, Druid installations are going to continue to depend on the presence of some SQL database.  > Currently Pinot is optimized better than Druid.

For instance, Ravanture (or something like that) is good for folks without strong resumes, yet folks here aren't taking anything less than a Big 4 with 200k+ in RSUs. Yet, I can think of no one who needs to attend a big data course worth so much  just take one at a local school for at most 5k.   When you do the math, they are pricing the course above the cost of a bootcamp (and well above the cost of any undergraduate or graduate course). In today's dollars (assuming a 2 percent inflation rate per year), the present value of the 24k cost is still about 23.26k. There aren't many bootcamps charging more than 20k, yet those charging a cost that high have a long history, proving themselves to be worth while.  If this firm were trying to convince me, I would demand some alumni salary data along with comparable folks that didn't attend the course. I suspect that they don't have this data. As such, they're trying to turn a larger than normal profit on you - unless you value their promised job as something.   Just take a big data course on the side, get any tech job, then network your way into the big data industry.

He is also incredibly smart and has proficiency in a lot of different technical areas such as *nix, networking, Windows systems, etc. etc., so at first I thought that his abrasive tone was due to him just being smart, but I'm starting to feel like he is on a power trip over me and sees me as a perp. Whenever I do something he doesn't like, he comes up to me and shows me exactly how I messed up and tells me how much it's made his job more difficult (and, mind you, it is very MINOR things). It has gotten to the point where he interrupts me when I'm talking to someone else on something he knows just so he can tell me I'm wrong. So, is this guy putting me in the mindset that I'm a threat to his authority and treating me like I'm a suspect? And if he is, how can I politely and respectfully tell him to stop treating me like I'm going to commit a crime?

Don't get me wrong, I have invested in number of coins myself with the idea to make quick money and with the hope that maybe some of them will deliver something valuable. Guess what? I did good money but when it comes to value I'm still waiting and I believe you all do. There are some interesting infrastructural projects but this is infrastructure for what?What is crypto all about? Let met think! Is it about efficiency? I don't think so! Let's consider the following: if I invest $Xmln in a new data center I will get computational power which will allow me to perform ""Y"" number of operations per second. To achieve the same over the blockchain I'll need to have access to huge number of CPUs in full power. That would cost as capital expense paid in gas over the time of the asset full amortization plus included all operational costs many times more. This is valid to the same extend when talking about big data storage. Decentralized solutions will always be less efficient then centralized because of the CAPEX and OPEX savings due to economy of scale. But is that all about efficiency? In the crypto world people always speak about decentralization. Why is that so important? Let's look at the human history via the perspective of decentralization of control and trust management. In the rise of the humanity at the end of the last ice age humans have been led by tribe chieftains. The chieftains have been accepted as the fathers of the tribe. They have been treated with respect by the others thus being the ultimate governing body for the whole tribe in all respects. They were all nomads governed by the laws of the nature. About 11000 BC - 9000 BC the first settlements appeared at the Levant and China. This led to highly populated villages that needed to be protected by the roaming nomads. The leading chieftains took the responsibility to protect the villages but for that they needed to stop working with the others. They also needed to gather an army and feed it as well as to build defence facilities. For that they ""kindly"" asked their yesterday tribe fellows to turn into farmers and start paying taxes. The rise of the centrally governed countries and the ruling elites was just about to begin. During the entire human history that followed the ancient times, the dark age, the renaissance, the industrial revolution and the current ""democratic capitalism"", humanity was constantly democratizing by decentralizing the control of the ruling elites. Is blockchain the next step in control and trust decentralization? The blockchain revolution is all about decentralization of power and interests, which brings freedom and equality of human rights to the next level of its natural development. During all of its history, people were striving for freedom and equal human rights. With every single step we are getting better in our endeavours to improve and make our society less dominated by the private interests of the few. The result is that we have never been more free then now. But why is blockchain so important in this process and its future? Blockchain is math. In the beginning the trust was delegated to different commodities and then gold and ""the gold standard"" appeared. Then ""trust"" was monopolized by the authorities run by individuals and there was no longer gold standard. We moved  the ""trust"" agency from ""something"" to ""someone"". Central and even private authorities like banks, health and other insurers, pension funds, notary offices, different clearing houses and others turned into the ultimate source of trust management nowadays. But what is ""authority"" and how it works? Central authorities are institutions created by the people and run by selected individuals empowered to take decisions on behalf of the crowd. Private authorities are centrally regulated private business companies with similar rights. Governments, tax authorities, banks, insurance companies and many others are all regulated by the law with the idea to act in best favor of the community but does that really works? Let's look at the human nature. Do you believe that people are born honest and with the time they learn dishonesty? Sounds logical doesn't it? Babies are clean as a mountain drop of water, right?  Here is the big surprise. Watch this video http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/u/kc4y0fvFHeBLVPkWJyLkHsalFs9GZuvlNIU76qyf3oHQgXObUqm5zA/. People are genetically programmed to lie for survival. Lie is one of our core survival instincts same like running or fighting depending on the situation. Lie is deeply incorporated in our brains. With the time our family and social pressure is programming us that telling the truth is a virtue and it really is. Truth is an essential component for the society to continue its development up to the next level. So we do become more honest with the time but what if it is about a bigger stake? And what if we are given the power to avoid retribution for our ""wrong"" behavior.  What if our decisions are coming at a price of high importance to us. Every person have a price at which he'll break. It might be a particular amount of money, or a bigger amount or maybe huge amount. Some people would not sell the virtues they believe in at any amount of money because they just don't value money this high but they are vulnerable when it is about something they care about more. Something of high value to them.So can we trust the authorities run by people or they would act in the best interest of....... ""them selves"", whatever their interest might be? When it comes to decisions related to their own interest people are emotional and subjective. Then how shall we shape the future of trust? The answer is hidden in mathematics. We'll shift the trust this time from ""somebody"" to ""maths"". Blockchain and more specifically the smart contracts are mathematical algorithms that helps us to avoid being in conflict of interests when we have to interpret a particular private or public agreement. Where do we need such solutions the most? If it is all about trust let's look at the industries where trust is a real challenge. This research http://www.insurancenews.com.au/local/financial-services-least-trusted-industry represents the industries and organizations enjoying the least level of trust by their community members. And the gold medalist is........... ""insurance"", followed by the entire financial sector and then the marketing is coming. Let's have a quick look at insurance and its roots.Insurance roots can be followed back to 3rd century when ship owners in ancient China came to the idea to collaborate in small groups collecting premiums to be paid in case of event thus reducing the individual risk for each ship owner. This whole concept got corrupt when the need to be scaled appeared. Less then a century later insurance was already known as ""An affiliation of pirate-gamblers who accept bets called premiums. The dollar amounts of the premiums are non-negotiable but the amounts of the claim settlements, should the company lose the bet, are rarely delivered without argument"". Nowadays insurance companies are in deep conflict of interests with their clients. Have you ever been worried that if you get hurt and have to claim insurance the insurer may try to find some reason and avoid paying especially if the amount is big? Expensive health problems abroad or at home? Real estate or car accidents, etc? Do you know how the claim payment is called in the insurers books? It's called ""loss"". Nobody wants to loose money and this is also valid for the insurance company managers and shareholders sooooo, they are ready to do whatever is needed to save the next quarter profit and if there is a way not to pay for your valid claim, they will just not pay. Remember the kids with the candies from the video above? The general idea of insurance is that it should be there when you really need it the most. But the reality is that at this very same moment you fall in deep conflict of interests with the organization that is supposed to be there when you are in trouble. This is not because insurers are bad people or their insurance math is wrong nor it is because the idea of sharing the risk between many is bad. The reason is hidden in the claim processing abuse opportunity. The claim processing in an insurance company is the procedure of collecting information and deciding weather to pay or not. But who collects the information and who takes the decision? All people getting such decisions are on payroll at the insurance companies and so they follow the instructions from their managers. Guess what happens if the company financials for the quarter doesn't goes well? But what if there is fully decentralized and transparent decision making process for the insurance industry with clear rules encoded in smart contracts and executed over the blockchain? This is what blockchain is all about and it is inevitable. Traditional insurers will not like this new reality coz they will lose the control so new players will arise and then the whales will have to follow. Insurance will be massively disrupted in the next years and in the heart of this revolution will be the decentralized claim decision making process.What about the banks? Notary offices ripping off their clients? I guess you already know the answer, but I'll cover more about that in my next article. ............................Blockchain and the crypto decentralization ideology will survive no matter what and its focus will be on trust, trust and trust only. We're now already able to afford paying the price of the new arising trustless economy by being a bit less efficient. Blockchain technology is not here for efficiency improvement. It is here to help us to decentralise the control of the ruling elites thus let us enter the new era of trustless economy where trust will no longer be subjective matter. Efficiency is important but virtues like love, trust, democracy, and freedom are and will always be way ahead in our priority list.There might be number of fluctuations  for these new arising crypto-blockchain economy within the years but the math behind will let it overcome any obstacles. This concept is next step in the evolution of the human kind and there is zero chance to be blocked by the current ruling elites dominating most of the governments worldwide. The domain will be regulated to some extend but will not be stopped. The long history of human kind is the best advocate for my claim.";That's probably the biggest waste of time you've ever committed to something.#anyway you can shorten this down so I can respond?#Tl dr...#Dead

But I'll vouch for University of Waterloo as a good school for mathematics for one particular reason if nothing else: of all the graduate & undergraduate students on campus, ~21% of them are part of the Math faculty. That's a lot of funding, campus space, lecturers/researchers, and a large peer group to work within if you wish to immerse yourself in a culture of mathematics, and meet others who will do the same.  A comparatively larger and perhaps better-known institution, University of Toronto, has [27 Master's students in mathematics](http://www.math.toronto.edu/cms/graduate-program/potential-students-grad/introduction-to-the-mathematics-graduate-program/), and 139 total graduate students in math when you account for the PhD candidates. By contrast, [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/institutional-analysis-planning/university-data-and-statistics/student-data/student-headcounts) has 44 doing a Master's in *Statistics*, over 400 doing a Master's in the math faculty, and over 750 total graduate students in mathematics including the PhD students. I know quantity isn't everything, but it does serve to show that Waterloo treats its math faculty as a point of pride and focus, which some people find good for their morale. It does make it rather competitive though, and if someone doesn't feel motivated by the prestige, the environment can be pretty taxing at times.  I will say, most people get a pretty immediate reaction as soon as they get to campus: either they feel at-home, or they desperately want to leave and never return. Everyone I've spoken to that followed their gut feeling was happy they did, one way or the other. As such, I'd recommend visiting and talking to some students or faculty if you are even considering it. If you want to message me, I can offer the email of a math-faculty recruiter who can answer any questions you may have, far better than I can. She deals with a lot of applicants from outside of Canada, and she's also a very sweet lady that I've known for years.  Canada overall, and Waterloo in particular is a pretty interesting place to be, but that is very much my personal bias speaking.  Just my personal musing, but bailing on an offer after you've accepted seems a bit rude, but that's about it. On the other hand, any respected program probably has more applicants than they can take, so someone will get offered that spot and be happy about it. The university would probably rather have students that are invested 100% in their program, rather than someone who's there just to be polite. And ultimately, a university is a business that you do not owe anything to, and your best investment in yourself is to seek the best opportunity available, wherever that is. Indirectly though, your success is what brings credibility to whichever institution you earned your undergrad at, so if you owe your current school anything, you should feel compelled to take the best chance at your own success, regardless of what school/job that takes you to after your undergrad. The market value of a university's degree is it's reputation, which is gained from having successful and respected alumni.   That's why I like to speak well about University of Waterloo to prospective students and colleagues even though I am no longer a student. I want my degree to maintain its credibility when I can't shape the academic environment personally, I want the current students to enjoy the same respect I did when I attended, and I feel all warm and fuzzy about giving back some positive exposure to the environment that affected my education (because they certainly aren't getting any monetary donations from me in the near future, still chasing my own success first.)#Uoft, UBC and Waterloo all have very well-regarded statistics programs. If your goal is a Phd, I'd recommend UBC or Waterloo over Uoft since their programs require you to write a thesis while Uoft's is purely coursework.     Disclaimer: I am an undergrad at Uoft and will likely do my Masters here.#I'm at UofT and one thing I tell you for sure is that we have some of the best researchers in the fields of AI and ML if you're interested in that stuff.

This kind of tech workers, who have a passion for the work they do, have a mutualistic relationship with the startups. They thrive in the turbulent and dynamic atmosphere of a new business, as they are usually home to many exciting decisions and opportunities. And if you are an entrepreneur who is currently gathering up a crew for your bright idea, you’re going to need people like them who share your level of enthusiasm.This article is not about merits of such minds, as I don’t think this is news for anyone out there. I will assume you already have a decent gang who wants to create cool things. It will be about one of the possible tendencies of such ambitious craftsmen, something that could pose a risk to the success of your venture that you should be wary about. Simply, **over-engineering**.## Roman Aqueduct ArgumentThe concept of over-engineering, building things in an unnecessarily complicated manner that will give you no benefit regarding reaching your targets  or ignoring **YAGNI** principle, spending time to add features **you ain’t gonna need** are traps to be avoided in every case of development. But for startups on a tight schedule that needs to act fast on present opportunities, these mistakes could be the difference between life-death depending on costs.Let’s go a step further. Think about the Roman aqueducts. Pinnacles of construction, aren’t they? They’ve been standing for thousands of years, while their contemporaries are lost in time. But is it a good idea to build something that you won’t be able to benefit from for the overwhelming majority of its lifespan? Dare I say it, is this a case of bad engineering? I don’t know if that would be fair, but Romans had the luxury to build those just to say fuck you to other civilisations throughout history. As a startup, you probably don’t. So let alone unnecessary complications or unneeded features, sometimes even building things to last, when they don’t suppose to, might be a bad idea.## How Can I Tell Something is Unnecessary?Well, you can’t sadly. Best you could do is challenging your developers for explanations of decisions with an apparent significant cost. Little pieces of complexities that no one can see without looking at the code should be manageable and trusting your teammates should be your first instinct either way. If you don’t have confidence in them to make the right decisions after a meaningful conversation, you’re either approaching things the wrong way or have the wrong teammates. What I’m going to do in this article is to help you out by listing few of the costly attractive concepts that should raise your eyebrow and trigger some of those conversations.# These are Bad Ideas (Except When They’re Not)### 1. You don’t need MICRO SERVICESThis is the big one. Oh yes, you definitely don’t need micro-services. Whatever the reason, you just don’t need it. But, but, to be scalabl- NO! It’s simply impossible for a startup to have microservices as a viable architecture initially. The operational complexity that comes with it, handling of transactions, and all other hardships that are a part of distributed computing are in no way a meaningful tradeoff for their benefits to any company trying to get its bearings. Especially without having a robust dev-ops infrastructure with good monitoring capabilities, you’re **guaranteed** to suffer for choosing microservices.Encourage your developers who are very adamant about using micro-services to create **stateless, loosely coupled** systems. When done right, they could be broken apart into their components in necessity.### 2. You don’t need BIG DATAAnother still popular buzz-word that peaked around 2015 is **big data**. It’s a vague concept in the way that it could mean a variety of things but doesn’t matter. First of all, ask yourself this: do you have any data at all right now, let alone big data? Yes, you have big ambitions. Yes, your venture will one day rule the world, and ruling the world comes with worlds of data. But until you do, you probably won’t need any tools and tech that provide solutions comes under the umbrella of big data.An average new business with a reliable financial forecast usually breaks even around three years. So, common sense says, even in the very rare case of everything going just the way you expect them to, you’re going to have some time until you have some users who will cause some big discussions regarding data access.### 3. You don’t need DATA MININGThis one is a little bit different, in that it’s not just a technique but more of a feature. So this could be thought also as a business decision rather than a strictly technical one. There two things to consider about data mining before going down this road. First, just like in the case of big data, you’re going to need some data to mine. Second, standard features that are enabled through data mining are usually complementary features that feed into your core business. So until you are sure that your core features are working as expected, and there are enough people using them, delay spending some time and money on data mining.Well, of course, there are obvious exceptions. Your business could be making use of already available data. Or analysing other people’s data could be the central part of your value proposition. In those cases just pretend I didn’t say anything.##What Do You Need, Then?You could encourage your IT team to spend some time on a **CI platform**, shortening your feedback loop from the very start. This should be easy enough and should make things comfortable for pivoting. Or make sure everything is **stateless** and **loosely coupled**, as it will make it easier to build on your foundations when things start to get complicated. Of course, there will be a time and place for the concepts in this article to make sense for you. You’ll just need to make sure your crew contains their excitement and waits for the right time.;"I can say as a developer for the 24 years and founder of a *successful* (operative word here folks...my expectations of success might vary from yours) company for the last 11+ years that this piece really resonates with me.    My partner (also a dev and founder) and I wrote our initial MVP software over a period of 8-1/2 months back in 2007.  Back then, we wanted to add various things and always had reign in our expectations versus our amount of runway (it wasn't much - about 13-15 months).  When it's your (or your investors') money on the line, if you don't absolutely need it, don't build it!  If you are able to give your vision legs and the market responds favorably, there will be time to go back and rewrite or augment these things later.    I would add another caveat to this list:  don't chase trends when it comes to technology.  Pick a technology stack you are familiar with that is capable of doing the job and stable.  Make sure it's got an established community if open source with some release history.  A fledgling company can't afford to invest time rewriting major systems in every flavor of the month.  Pick what works and again, once you're successful, you can stand up a new environment to demo or prototype cool new languages or libraries.  Your only goal should be getting that MVP finished and stable without incorporating every Silicon Valley tech flavor of the rainbow...    I was fortunate in that we got our MVP released (it was close to failure a number of times) and our business established.  Years later, I've got a development staff and huge amount of resources to play with so I can do R&D with some of the newer stuff but it rarely makes the transition to our production code base.  I always think back to those early days and all the things we thought the market wanted and then ask myself ""Will this feature sell?  How many of our customers really would use it?  Is it something the salespeople can understand and sell?  Will marketing be able to distill this new feature down to a coherent message?""  Your message is spot on... #One of the worst companies I ever worked in was one where the project manager was obsessed with microservices. We were constantly building stuff that never got used  constantly deadlocked by other developers' work. Eventually, half of the staff left.  The CTO of Uber gave a really interesting talk about how much he regretted going with microservices. They also had the problem of hiring too many engineers too quickly, so that might have played into it as well."

The best thing you could do is try to find a position that gets you exposure to database development, ideally working with someone who's been doing it for a while and likes to teach.#Not necessarily. I work as a database developer and don't have any degree or certs. Anything is possible.#getting a degree in data science to work in database dev is like going to med school to give someone a bandaid  data science is waaaaaay more than database work.  do you want a degree in data science? or do you want to teach yourself SQL?

I've dabbled into various other things like BI, C#, javascript stuff but I always anchored my core in databases. Unfortunately I didn't follow the times close enough and I think the real fun and valuable work now in 'data' are either big data, data engineering or ML/AI/data science work. Now I'm thinking of switching and it's not been that easy. I've got 3 options for me (1) chug along my current job and get some management experience (2) switch teams to our internal big data team (3) get a foot into a real tech company.Option 3 is the most ideal but also hardest without any relevant experience in the subject. Also likely a pay cut since it will be a more junior role. Option 2 is the next most ideal but I'm beginning to dislike this company so wanna get out if possible. Option 1 is the most socially acceptable path and money wise it's there best for now but I've come to terms that I'll care less about this for now. I've been broiling over this for the last 3 months and trying to self improve from coursera, side projects, self learning python, applying to jobs, schools and bootcamps, talking to mentors on top of my day job it's really taking its toll. What should I do?? My main focus right now is just to remain hireable in the burgeoning tech fields.;What is your current job? Also what isn’t your current industry and what are your degrees in? Data is incredibly expansive and vital. I think you should continue to learn, work on your side projects and keep covering the different areas. It seems like you’re already well versed in data engineering and data governance. You may have to commit to one data area in terms of the industry. Ml/AI/ and data science is all more on the analytics side and separate data engineering and etl. Also it’s crazy competitive. If money isn’t an issue I would still try to build up my skills in all these areas but try to have a central focus as to which Side of the entire data ecosystem you want to focus on. Because you may get hired for a specific data role, let’s say in big data just as an example, but you’ll be able to integrate some of the other areas like analytics and applications development.  Also, don’t go to a data boot camp. Unless it’s  more of a fellowship than a bootcamp(like what insight does) or its free(unlikely).

We are in a new era of big data, one which we don't even know the true extent of. Google likely collects data on every search anyone has ever made and more...FaceBook likely knows every publicly visible aspect of its users' social lives...Amazon likely knows every transaction ever made on its site, and has an understanding of basically the entire US economy as a result...And even if they don't know everything, someone else will find what they're looking for soon enough.

What about if one of those companies sells that data to another company so that that company can manipulate the public into voting for a particular canadite?#Hi,  Okay, the basis of this proposition is about **cost**.  You don't care about what happens to data, and you don't want to do anything different to curate your data going out because it is not **worth** the extra effort, OR the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.  &nbsp   I agree on the ubiquitous and super-saturated aspect of big data, but let's consider some things that can go wrong on some levels. This is the opposition of your view, and it's up to you if you **value** the following levels.  &nbsp   #Personal level  On a personal level, your data leak (and even data permanence - your data remaining on the internet for the end of time) can be quite bad for your security and reputation (companies will use data like that to discriminate against you, or if not them personally, the algorithms will) and you will be at a disadvantage compared to never posting online at that day. It's a chance, it might come back to haunt you. It's not even paranoia, just do this experiment at work: Google the name of a person at work, and see just how much you can find. Also, google your name.  Not to mention if you have people that are malignant towards you that wish to cause you harm. You don't have to go in politics for this to be an issue, and make you uncomfortable.  As a summary, the ""commodities"" here are:  - Privacy  - Security  - Reputation  They are not impacted HEAVILY, but slightly, and gradually.  #Manipulation level  I think people grossly underestimate the impact of algorithms in their live, and just how easily we are manipulated by the choices we make.   A note here, a product that has good marketing and good use of your data is not necessarily a good product for you, the consumer. So the argument that you like seeing ads, is questionable from my view. If you wish to buy something, you know what you want, and you will get it.  #Future level - AI  This is a threat that will start to ramp up slowly but steadily, but we have seen its effects.  Even if big data is tremendously big, so will the processing power and methods to parse it will grow bigger and bigger through AI tech. That AI tech will only grow in the power it has over you, and we don't know if this AI falls in the wrong hands, or if the AI itself is benevolent or not. It's risky in the long term, since we have evidence of it ramping up during our lifetime.  &nbsp   Overall, in my view,  I think it's good to put some little effort to develop good data behaviors and habits, so in this sense it is advantageous for your development to ""care"" a bit about these issues, in order to avoid potential risks.  How much effort is the best match, that depends on many variables, but I am pretty sure it is almost impossible for the right answer to be ""0 effort"" (meaning, not caring at all)."

For example, I can't even find a simple reference for the supported options for ""parquet.compress""I know Hive supports compressing parquet with at least Snappy and Gzip (maybe bzip2 as well) but I can't even find the list of supported options. Where do I find this type of information? Am I just totally blind or are docs just non-existent for all of these open source big-data apps?";Are you on CDH or Apache Hive?  The docs for CDH 5.6 state UNCOMPRESSED, SNAPPY, and GZIP.  In general I start with the distribution docs first (Hortonworks, Cloudera, MapR) as sometimes there is variations from the Apache Docs as all distributions are forked from the trunk.  https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-6-x/topics/cdh_ig_parquet.html#parquet_hive#In [this book](https://www.bookdepository.com/Hadoop---The-Definitive-Guide-4e/9781491901632) at page 372 it is written that the possible formats are: UNCOMPRESSED SNAPPY  GZIP and LZO.  Yes, there is a problem with the documentation in Hadoop related projects. Some of them are even abandoned.#Yeah.   It's a pain in the ass.   Lots of features in parquet you can configure.

I am a novice at big data techniques but did the following:1) compiled a dataset from biodistribution literature with restrictions (same injection mode, balb/c mice, quantified the same way) 2) normalized the data within each paper so it could be compared (due to different units) 3) did a PCA in MATLAB. The PCA states that all the data only depends on the first component and literally cannot decimate the data by type of virus or other factors we thought influenced biodistribution in balb/c mice. Is anyone here familiar with datasets and how to pull out which factors are important?;Without knowing anything about your data, one important thing that you need to do before do the PCA is to scale the features for the PCA.

Your existing creditors (credit cards, loans, etc..) can continue reporting your balances and payments.  It's possible enough has remained the same with your credit reports that your score hasn't changed.#Freezes only affect new tradelines/queries.  Existing business relationships can pull/report through freezes.  So the thing with your FICO continuing to be reported and updated is normal.

On one side, you have [We Counter Hate](https://wecounterhate.com/), a new campaign designed to flag and counteract hate speech on Twitter. On the other, you have the shady electioneering of Cambridge Analytica.The platforms themselves are beginning to take the bulk of the criticism. But is that fair? Or are they technologies that people should be able to use as they want?**[Podcase link here](https://soundcloud.com/connectedanddisaffected/s2e18-countering-hate-ft-jason-carmel)**;The platforms have an ethical responsibility to ensure the data they collect and make accessible is protected in a way that minimizes harm (which means they probably need binding contracts specifying how and when data can be used by developers, and they need to be far more clear with their users how and to whom this data is being released). That doesn't inherently make them responsible when the data is misused, but their hands aren't completely clean in this. They (along with just about every company these days) do a pretty terrible job protecting user/consumer data.  This is the new reality, and yes, we need to adapt to ensure data is secure and not misused. The people who hold the keys and who have the pragmatic capabilities to monitor how the data is being used should do that voluntarily  alternatively, they'll likely be forced to by some regulatory agency.  At the same time, organizations like CA have ethical responsibilities too. At the end of the day, the platforms themselves are just middlemen. Where there is demand, there will be supply. If not Facebook, it will be some other platform. We must also put the light on people/organizations that are hellbent on manipulating people unethically for disproportionate gain. I would put my focus on these organizations over Facebook or other platforms, because they're ultimately the ones with unethical intentions.

The difference between a masters thesis and a PhD dissertation are pretty significant though and I wouldn't suggest a PhD unless you are passionate about research and ready to spend many years on the same project with minimal supervision and help.

somethingimade;88tj5k;1522612618.0;/r/somethingimade/comments/88tj5k/i_wrote_a_nonfiction_book_and_i_liked_it/;I wrote a non-fiction book and I liked it;About a year ago, I set off on a mission - to write and publish a book. On the 1st of March this year, I achieved my goal! It was a satisfying, frustrating, enjoyable, nightmarish experience - but I would do it all over again. I would be absolutely thrilled if you'd take a look, and if you'd like to review it I'd be more than happy to send an electronic copy.Here's some blurb:This book explores some of the big subjects in technology and human life today in a light-hearted, humorous yet detailed fashion. The history of where technologies came from, how they have influenced our lives and where they might send us in the future are all considered. If you have ever wondered about artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, cybercrime and hacking, big data, robots, fake news, personalisation, search engines, the deep and dark web, how the Internet works, 3D printing, social media or a myriad of other topics, this is the book for you.Paperback: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bamboozled-Guide-Technology-Modern-Perplexed/dp/1980449678Ebook:  https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bamboozled-Guide-Technology-Modern-Perplexed-ebook/dp/B07B699LXH;Hey pal, I did exactly the same late last year. I sold a few copies which was a pleasant surprise. Not a huge amount, but more than just my friends.  Anyways, because I know what it means, I bought a copy and I'll get around to it and leave you a review
Drugs;89g812;1522776420.0;/r/Drugs/comments/89g812/the_big_data_have_the_potential_to_be_a/;The Big Data have the potential to be a treacherous weapon against drug users;"Please dont read this if you are high right now, you could potentially get paranoid. We are not in danger today, but could be in the future. Its all hypothetical, not yet a reality. Big data is basically a giant amount of data stored of virtually anything, including social media and search engines. Together with data annalists and artificial intelligence, it can get conclusions that would be impossible to simple human beings. If done right, it can conclude and deduct things about someone like [potential illness](http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/01/pf/data-consumer-health/index.html) or [things that not even your loved ones knew about it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#65c5ce6b6668).Hypothetically, if you are reading this you are probably a drug user. If you are a drug user, there is great odds that you have/had anxiety, depression or adhd.If an AI could potentially learn about someones: *disorders + your search history + your behavior on social media + data that for us humans don't seems to have no relevance but actually says a lot*, it could, in theory, safely deduct that you use illicit drugs, therefore a criminal in the eyes of law.You can argue that if used like this, the Big Data would be used against dealers and cartels only. But in the War on Drugs the user is the main victim. And if it were used this way, the user would be targeted as well.We are totally safe for now. Obviously its not a ""conspiration"" against us or anything like that. But just imagine this power in the hands of a [blood thirsty assassin like Rodrigo Duterte, president of the Phillippines](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/senator-rodrigo-duterte-drug-war-killed-20000-180221134139202.html).

(Help);[deleted];"Standard for early stage advisor would be somewhere in the 0.9% to 1.2% range.  And it sounds like you've done more work than an advisor, and have more unpaid work to come.  Remember, these are lottery tickets.  Don't forget to negotiate actual cash money and benefits and a time when they will need to be paid.  You should be accruing pay NOW, even if they can't actually afford to pay you.  And when they get their series A they need to cut you a check and continue to do so.  If they don't make series A, whatever...they are bankrupt and that debt is as useless as your equity.#You're getting fucked. You're a co-founder. You should have been cut into it as a co-founder from day 1. Waiting how things shake out and then ""negotiating"" how much equity you get is retarded. What if they offer 0.1% and refuse to go higher? Are you going to quit and get $0 for your effort?

The full post can be found here: http://inspirationpub.com/2018/03/18/7-big-data-and-confirmation-bias/;It gets so messy with the power that comes from such large data sets. It almost requires one to approach all situations without assumption or bias in order for the phenomena to present without the influence of preconception. In addition, the data points that are tracked can create bias where there previously was none. I try to account for the maximum amount of variables so I can at least accurately understand my own bias or the bias of the frame I have constructed to tease insight from data.

It wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if using firms like this was already the political norm. That said, this shit is completely reprehensible and we need to set a strong deterrent against using these kinds of tactics. The entire senior team of this firm + whoever in Trump's campaign set this up should rot in prison to set a message imo.

I am from Sweden and working for a medium big Big Data company mostly administrating Hadoop and Elastic search with surrounding applications to work with that.I have worked here 11 months now with decent salary, but last week I got a phone call from a recruiter in UK again (When i got this job i was contacted by a UK recruitment firm) This time was different tho, they are looking for someone to work as a Big Data SysAdm in London with a pay that is 2x more than i have currently.This would involve a move from Sweden to London since i am single and don't really have any commitments here it would be possible but it is kinda ""Scary"" to just move to another country to work without being 100% about everything.So what I am asking is tips, have any of you moved like this to work? Tips and tricks? Questions to ask to be sure about everything, and how is it to move to London of all places.I already told them to even think of it I would need a Moving Package from their side and from the sound of it that would be no issue.";Go  with your gut feeling. how much will this new job potentially benefit you? Are you leaving family and friends behind? Is that important to you in life?  Do not just go chasing the money, chances are something with good pay will happen in your current country.

Does a program exist already?;"Is there a website that lets us view a year or more temperature/humidity sensor data from a CSV file?              It sounds like something someone may have already written, given the number of available sensors on the market.I've got a SensorPush model it has a data viewer Android app, but it's lacking a ""select a section"" zoom, and an overlay of weekly results. It's also not on my PC!         So I exported the data - and it's in the CSV format of:               >""Timestamp"",""Temperature_Celsius"",""Relative_Humidity""                ""2017-05-06 12:34"",""22.99"",""36.45""                ""2017-05-06 12:35"",""23.34"",""43.53""                ""2017-05-06 12:36"",""23.39"",""43.04""                ""2017-05-06 12:37"",""23.38"",""42.83""                ""2017-05-06 12:38"",""23.35"",""42.74""                ""2017-05-06 12:39"",""23.30"",""42.68""                ""2017-05-06 12:40"",""23.24"",""42.71""                Hah, quotes around the floats!So the data:           It's an ASCII CSV file.         There's a years worth of data - 500,000 items, sampled ever minute.           Each record is : ISO standard date and time, and two series.                      I'm hoping there's something that can navigate a chart of that data as one long linear one... and zoom in to places of interest.     Another display the program should do is overlay the data into week chunks so I can compare temperature changes.If not - I was thinking of putting together a website that lets anyone with generic sensor data to upload it!So my other main question is - what JavaScript ""Big Data"" charting software does anyone recommend?Thanks for your time!";Spreadsheet programs like MS Excel or Libreoffice Calc are made for this and will happily load your CSV.  The standard JavaScript library for charting is [D3](https://d3js.org). There are many others a Google search away.

I have interviewed some people who works in Big Data in local banks and IT. Now I'm looking for an expert outside my country to complement my work.Here are my 5 questions:1. How often do you see Big Data in companies? It's used widely or in very specific companies?2. How much has improved a company after implementing something related to Big Data?3. Is there any requisites for a company to roll out a Big Data architecture?4. What software / hardware do you work with5. Do you think we'll get, at some point, to a volume of data that obliges companies to use Big Data?Thank you in advance, and sorry for my English its not my native language. ;Hello!

I've set up a home server to do data storage for my wife and me, a Ubuntu Server machine running ZFS with about 6TB available space. This works great for in-place data integrity and storage, and I'm really happy with it.However, I'm trying to figure out the best way to do off-site backups for our data. If our apartment burns down, I'd be really upset if we lost all of our photos, financial docs, etc.Obviously this is a big amount of data for a home backup solution, so I've done a bit of research into personal cloud and more exotic pooling filesystems. One hard requirement is encryption, at least for some of the data (I don't really care about encrypting photos, but documents I do).I've boiled it down to two options (but if you have another idea, please let me know!!!):* Backblaze/etc ""traditional"" backup using their $5/mo unlimited plan -- can select a folder on the server and back it up.* Backblaze/etc ""cloud"" backup using their paid/per/GB cloud service, with a tool like Restic which does file deduplication and compression, snapshotting, etcWith ""option 1"", the benefits:* Easy restore -- no custom tools required. In 15 years if I die in a fire and my wife needs to restore, she doesn't have to be looking up Linux command line arguments* Encrypted, with the additional optional of a user-specified key* Relatively cheapCons:* No pooling/compression automatically* No snapshotting, file-level versioning (I don't think)* Encryption key managementWith ""option 2"", the benefits:* Really nice features like file-level versioning, pooling, etc* Personalized, non-Backblaze-managed encryption which is independently vetted* Charged per GB, and is actually cheaper than their other optionCons:* Custom software (Restic) relied on* Encryption key management* No ability to ""view and download"" easily -- restore requires a linux box to handle the pooled filesystemSo, my specific questions/suggestion requests:* Of these two options or styles of options, what makes the most sense as a family data off-site backup solution?* How should keys be managed? I was thinking of writing it on a flash drive and a piece of paper and storing in a bank lock box, but is there another way?* Any other gotcha's that I'm not thinking of?";If your wife is not tech savvy or you cannot just let her instructions on how to restore a Restic Backup from BlackBlaze then what I would do is to buy a HDD big enough to store all your data, format it and encrypt it with LUKS or something like that and then make periodic backups with rsync (using -va option so it will not delete old files and it'll actually act as a backup and not sync) to this HDD. This way you can just store this HDD in a safe place where you can just grab it in a case of emergency and if you do at least weekly backups, in the worst case scenario you'll just lose one week of documents. However, I personally don't trust in just one backup method. My computer is setup to backup hourly with Back in Time for documents, a second full backup for my system, a third backup with Borg for not just documents but also VMs and everything and another online backup with Restic.  Restic does not have compression option  however, it does have deduplication and in some cases is even better than compression. I don't really trust on companies doing the encryption. If you trust it, then also there's Mega. Mega have Linux client and claim to be end to end encrypted. Also there's Spideroak that also have a backup tool. Mega don't have a backup tool I think but I read recently that they're doing file versioning.  Restic is a great tool. I think I would do the Restic option. If you're using Restic maybe you could consider another option for storage that can be cheaper, like Google Drive. If you don't care if a service can see your photos unencrypted, then your solution is Google Photos. You can backup all your photos there and if you convert them into their format it doesn't consume any space from your plan. Doing that you can dramatically reduce the size of your backup. Maybe if you have 6TB of data and your photos are 3TB or 4TB, then you can pay for just 2 or 3TB for your documents backup, which will make a really big difference in the price of your online storage.   Overall, like I said, Restic is a really great tool and with simple script and a cron job you can have an excellent and secure tool for your backups.  About managing keys, I don't know why you need to store it in a bank but if you do that, then print it. You don't know how much time that will be there so... You don't know if a USB can be reliable stored for years maybe.   Also, it is worth checking out rsync.net for cloud storage. They also have backup solutions and if you have your own tools, you can ssh. One great tool that I really like for backups is Back in Time. Back in Time is really easy to use, I use it for my wife and I know she understand it well, it support encryption but is Encfs and some people say is not reliable. I've been using Encfs for years now with Dropbox and it has never fails me but it does not hide size of files. I don't care much about that but some people do. Anyways, Back in Time is awesome for documents and pictures, it has ssh option and I thing rsync cloud with back in time would be like having the dead crash plan but you actually have your own encryption method. As far as I know, rsync is really awesome in support. I don't know think I've wrote too much. So good luck.

To put this in perspective, consider the fact that famous theorists always use courseware to overcome this obstacle. With EKBOW, we are seeking forward-thinking submissions that demonstrate the technical unification of DHTs and DHTs, which embodies the robust principles of embedded electrical engineering. Thusly, game-theoretic technology and object-oriented languages offer a viable alternative to the understanding of Boolean logic.Important dates:Drafts due: April 8, 2018Notification of acceptance: June 5, 2018Final submissions due: August 2, 2018Conference date: September 25, 2018Keynotes:* Prof. Bennie Ali - University of WyomingA understanding of IPv7* Sandi Webb - University of Western AustraliaImportant unification of DHTs and Markov models* Dr. Katarina Fuller - University of FloridaA understanding of courseware* Claudine Villa - Colorado School of MinesUnderstanding of courseware* Rebecca Parrish - Shiraz UniversityKey unification of web browsers and agentsTopics:Cloud-based networkingIndependently noisy hardware and architecture, and partitioned e-voting technologyMarkov high-performance computingProgram Committee Members:Laurie Glass - Nanjing Agricultural UniversityGuo Dalton - Aarhus UniversityPast EKBOW locations:Mingguang, ChinaGenova, ItalySteering Committee:Noam Phelps, Chiang Mai UniversityAs one of the appropriate conferences of the 2015 conference on heterogeneous, vertical modalities, EKBOW is committed to being a colloquium for answering the key challenges in the emulation, synthesis, and evaluation of the understanding of the memory bus and collaborative modalities. Certainly, cutting-edge revisions are asked for on steganography, randomized electrical engineering, and high-performance computing. The symposium also tries at rendering a colloquium for interchanging groundbreaking works from information theorists and futurists on technologies to evaluate game-theoretic big data. Obviously, this special issue intends to explore a multimodal tool for enabling public-private key pairs, disproving that kernels and IPv4 with 64 bit architectures are regularly incompatible.We are delivering you this accouncement, anticipating that you will consider submitting several revisions to EKBOW. The special session happens in Shizuoka, Japan on October 13, 2018. But, exceptional works taken by EKBOW will be provided as manuscripts in the volume of the workshop on concurrent, scalable, knowledge-based complexity theory.;Welcome to THE PURGE.

artificial;9lpr59;1538770175.0;/r/artificial/comments/9lpr59/third_wave_of_ai_could_ai_reason_abstractly/;Third Wave of AI - could AI reason abstractly without depending on massive computation power;I’ve been thinking about this for a while — saw an article that presented a similar thought... Seems like most people in AI — big chip developers especially — are banking on the assumption that the future of AI will require exponentially more computational power than what is available today. Basically just a big data and computations arms race. But what if that’s like thinking in 1901 that the only way to improve transportation was to figure out how to strap 40 horses to a wagon, instead of 4? What’s the AI equivalent of the internal combustion engine? As this article points out, assuming AI gets more and more computationally intense is full of many problems. From the costs to the inefficiencies to how invasive the data is, it doesn’t seem like the only path forward.Would love to hear people’s thoughts on where AI might be headed, and your take on the other types of data structures that might be out there, like the ‘canonicals’ mentioned in this article. Does AI need to be able to reason abstractly? https://medium.com/mind-ai/what-if-the-next-breakthrough-in-ai-doesnt-depend-on-massive-computing-power-cbdf9740a8f1;"I think AI on the contrary will need less data in the future.  \- Why do people say it will require more and more computational power ?  It is clear that today a lot of companies are talking up the goods of combining big data and artificial intelligence to make better models, and a lot of research done by these companies try to improve the way we manipulate huge data resources and the computing power. But ... as you pointed out, big chips developers like to say that, and big data sellers like to say that. Because it makes their business. Nevertheless, we can only enjoy the fact to have more power at our disposal, but we certainly don't want to use this power at it's maximum for basic applications. We, ( as people who does not have interest in selling chips and data ) can only hope for better algorithms that require less data to be efficient.  \- Why do I think it will require less data ?  Because our brain requires so few data to be efficient. There are no reason we can't do better with AI. This being said, the paths that could lead toward it are certainly numerous. To my mind, it is a matter of better linking different mathematical point of view that'll make us see the big picture.  1. I think understanding the whole learning process of different algorithms as bayesian inferences could help us compare the algorithms with our brain ( as a lot of successful research compared the learning process of our brain  to bayesian inferences -> see Stanislas Dehaene work ) and maybe give us hints on how to learn with less data. 2. Develloping general paradigms for learning like reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning ( today only a few companies seem to be interested in reinforcement learning because it is hard to apply in real world applications ). 3. Better understanding the differences between how a neural network learns and how our brain learns. We saw through different failures of neural nets that they weren't quite acting like our brain (i.e adversarial examples that fools networks are absolutely well identified by us !). Some of these failure certainly shows that we miss something big.  &#x200B   It will be an exiting journey !#Dont get me wrong, i love thinking about this stuff but by no means do i know anything real about it.  I feel like it could, but do you want 100% accuracy or do you want to mimic human intelligence.  Organic beings tend to skip a ton of steps once we have learned something but will often make tons and tons of mistakes, the majority that you dont even realize because your senses wont pick it up or they will just tell you that you were right and keep on going forward. However, as explained in a different comment, ""AI"" today does stats really well and more flops means more data processing and if statements which is basically what it does ( i think). also, these computers need to store this ""learned"" info so there it tons of storage issues that we are going to need to figure out too. Im not sure what the human data storage for the brain is estimated at but i bet a big room of AWS servers is exponentially more.   So to end my rant i feel as if we can get the skipping steps part down it could be ""easy"" but do we really want that in a computer AI?#I think this is a misleading question, the article is mainly a piece explaining why we should focus on AI away from computional intensity. The question whether or not it is possible is a completely different question. It seems that AI is moving to push for computational intesity to quickly try and develop the technology after which it would then probably will try to decrease the actual computation cost after the AI goals have been reached.  &#x200B   I do see the need to move to less computation power need in AI but I m skeptical on the actual timeline.#> that’s like thinking in 1901 that the only way to improve transportation was to figure out how to strap 40 horses to a wagon, instead of 4?  Not quite. The difference is that advances in AI/ML are helping us build faster, more power-efficient computer chips (which, in turn, helps us crunch bigger AI/ML problems, cheaper). So, it's a virtuous circle. In the short term, yes, we are going to just throw tons and tons of compute cycles at AI/ML. The reason this is a big deal is that businesses can calculate the total cost-of-ownership (or amortize through a dedicated compute-services provider, such as AWS) of compute hardware. By contrast, calculating the total cost of paying web developers to design and roll out a new web service is a lot like astrology. When a business can take a problem it needs to solve and turn it into a sliding scale of an objective measurable versus dollars... that's a big deal. And AI/ML packages + raw compute horsepower is enabling businesses in many sectors to begin doing just this.  In the medium-to-long term, yes, the pressure to optimize AI/ML hardware/software stacks is going to become immense, precisely because the demand to utilize these systems is skyrocketing, and will only continue to skyrocket going forward. Just look at Nature, whether physics, biology or whatever -- demand for compute is absolutely unlimited. Where compute used to be locked up in the temple of pocket-protector-wielding uber-nerds who speak and dream in binary, compute is becoming accessible to less and less specialized people, even businesspeople.# AI an artificial intelligence machine will need more computation powwr if not it would  only produce the  same output for the same input at all times as regards to it bin referred to as an intelligent machine. AI has to be improved over time continously, for new updates.#I think that yes, down the line some AI computation will be optimized to use less computation and it will also probably be based on some sort of shared models.  MindAIs overview reminds me of the OpenCog atomspace hypergraph.  I think that it's hard to envision a really general purpose AI that only has concepts without them being built from the ground up including something like sensorimotor input.  The grounding seems necessary for true understanding of abstract concepts.  One thing that seems tough is that the real world is fairly complex and data intensive so at some point there may be a limit to how much you can simplify your processing and still accurately react to the environment.  One could imagine that perhaps higher level reasoning might take less computation.  But again to be accurate there seems a need for some type of grounding, e.g. an abstract geometrical reasoning process might be very efficient in one way but involve a bit more computation for visualization to confirm.  But I think that yes there are many optimizations coming down the line, in terms of perhaps not-yet-invented data and parallel compute structures, common models, hardware optimization, specialization, etc.#I suspect the next breakthrough will come from neuromorphic chips.  Check out SPAUN at Waterloo. Neuron dynamics, integration, inhibition, and leaks all may have rich semantic encoding properties.  Numenta meets SPAUN on a neuromorphic chip. SPAUN already has a library going for Intel's new chip.   Semantic encoding and structure recall need major improvement. This is probably key to transfer learning, strong semantics with easily determined relationships.   GANs are simulating our suggest and criticize half and half brainstructure already. I think strong critics mixed with the strong semantic and determining will form the next step.   Although, Ilya's speech at NVIDIA indicated that openAI taught a honey bee (sim) brain to win at Dota using RL over a mellenia. Apparently, you can teach a been to play vids if you have 1000 years to do it, so brute Computation will continue to yield staggering results.  On the brute side, I think that cross training of sufficiently large and sparsly weighted NN may be capable of strong transfer learning.  Both paths really come down to brain electrogeometry simulation on full scale. I think we are heading towards biomimicry no matter what.#It will be interesting to see if the AI industry will be open to follow the path established by the work of miners in distrubuted networks in postioning the computational workload not on super computers but on incentivizing the masses to contribute to a protocol on a network. From an economic standpoint its already been proven to be quite an effective alternative strategy, its just a question of which projects are willing to take that risk and be able effiectly implement a protocol that can harvest the insight and contributions of a distrubuted group rather than really on in-house supercomputers. #For some reason I am now picturing a steam-powered robot furiously driving a giant train of horses from the cab of a porsche.   But this is a good question. More of the same rarely brings about the next big breakthrough. #Don't really know of the cost of AI could be reduced to become more affordable in the future. For the Data needs always need updates don't know what kind of network could bring about a definite solution for A I #Abstraction can be boiled down to nlogn time, possibly more.  But it atm is an unsolved problem.#Aren't people afraid of AI?  With AI,  - Why do I think it will require less manpower?   This is because people with limited knowledge have to be laid off because all the super computers will be eating up their jobs. I am really sure they won't be creating as many jobs as internet did.  People with not so niche skills will be on road searching for job.  &#x200B   &#x200B #But you don't need to take chances or come up with scary new ideas in order to strap more horses to the wagon!  It's a nice simple arms race that every CEO and investor can understand.  The ""AI"" in the news today are essentially complex statistics.  They have their place, and scale well with computational power, but they're not intelligence and they will hit a wall sooner or later.  Just as food for thought, the brain can do around 200 sequential operations per second.  Take a moment to think about that, and how in order to get anything done in realtime, it has to compensate by essentially doing every different computation it can, in parallel, and then discard almost all of it continually.  An optimized architecture with more sequential speed could be trillions of times more efficient than what evolution came up with, simply by virtue of being able to think about what to think.#So far, how many tools do we have that are dramatically more energy efficient than the human equivalent, and are those gains in pure mechanical leverage? For example, do cars run more efficiently than humans (distance per kJ)? I ask because I'm wondering what our expectation should be. The human brain consumes a ton of energy, and that's without turning on the juice.  #Wallah, I really like the article and I am reading it thru all the comments now.  This is just to begin with I guess. I hope I get in notification for new articles too. #John McCarthy (one of the founders of AI), decades ago, said that one day ""the simplest computer"" will be able to play grandmaster-level chess using ""cleverer algorithms"". He still hasn't been proven wrong (but we've probably stopped searching).#A future that could one day be as tied to the state of artificial intelligence as it is to the state of the crypto markets today.#Similarly in fields such as planning and search, reasoning and theorem proving, contributions from both A.I. and complexity researchers have been of major importance. There are, however, many examples of A.I. specialisms which are only beginning to attract serious attention from theoreticians. This workshop should provide not only a platform through which participants can report on recent developments within fields where Complexity Theory and A.I. already interact, but also heighten awareness of A.I. disciplines in which a foundation for such interaction can be constructed. Its main focus will concern a select number of topics where interaction between complexity theory and artificial intelligence has been particularly fruitful. Among these are: search, planning & scheduling problems, knowledge representation and reasoning  theorem proving techniques, multi-agent interactions and agent systems, Argumentation and Dialogue Games  phase-transition phenomena.#comparing humans to machine intelligence aside, the fact is that we are taking a highly invasive approach to machine learning which is not 100% necessary.  Right now most of the corporations are using massive amounts of data and pattern matching algorithms to extract ""tags"" or categorize data based on thousands or millions of examples.  This is an approach that works most of the time, but the downside is the computing power necessary for training.  Another major con to this method is the limited number of patterns that can be recognized while everything else is treated as garbage or noise.  The overall example of this being imagenet, using millions of examples tagged by humans.  Outside of object recognition in images and video, other systems like the ones that facebook and google use are also based on the same idea: train on big data, find interesting patterns, exploit those patterns on the other side.  It all comes down to statistics using these methods.  But perhaps there is another way.  For instance, take the case of object tracking in a video.  To track an object, the system must first take a frame of video and then scan it for known objects.  After finding the location of each object, it goes to the next frame and finds the location again.  Given that prior training was given, the system is pretty efficient.  To recognize a face, a current ML system needs at least 100,000 training examples which takes a lot of time to gather and process.  Even then, why are there no self driving cars in India?  Because there is no way to categorize the chaos that is an Indian street.  Even some reports say that rickshaws (which are as common almost as pedestrians) are so customized that a self-driving car cannot recognize them.  The way I see it, there are way too many new types of possible patterns and objects to recognize in any data set that is using real-world data.  If there are an infinite amount of possibilities, it means that there is no upper-limit as to how much processing will be needed in order to successfully categorize everything.  Ever since I was a kid, I hated tags.  It seems everyone has to dumb someone else or something else down into a category so that their brain can stop working on trying to figure things out.  Why can't you see another human as simply who they are?  Why must you label them as whatever you label them as?  Even then, many different cultures have many labels which have many different meanings. So with the ""categorization"" approach, MI pundits are trying to put everything into a standardized category which is not realistic.  All I'm saying really is that with properly formed AI, you won't need a cloud to process your data for you and return an answer.  Current smartphones and computers could run the algorithm with little CPU power and generate more impressive results. #On my part, the big advantage if we adopt AI will allow people to do new and interesting things that have never been done before. That’s the fun part, so don't look it bad in our human race.#We know that computers are themselves simply machines that implement functions. And so, according to functionalism, mental states are like the software states of a computer. In theory, then, it is possible that a machine running the right kind of computer program could have mental states, it could literally have a mind. It could have beliefs, hopes and pains. And, if it could have a mind, then it could also be intelligent and that is Artificial Intelligence.#Oh... I read comments and articles on AI. What comes to my mind is the future of AI. I read about a subset of AI called Machine Learning is also taking AI to the next level. Machine Learning provides systems or machines the ability to learn and improve without being explicitly programmed. In other words, the capability of machines to learn for themselves including the ability to analyze extensive volumes of data to identify patterns and predict outcomes without the need for human intervention. And the question that came to my mind was what if the machine malfunction? What if the outcome(s) were totally wrong? I don't know if I'm thinking loud or may be I don't know much about AI#Familiar with a prediction use case where the customer had 14 sensors per asset and after ML analysis, what they wanted to predict could be done with 4 sensors. Savings of $25K/asset in instrumentation. #Interesting. Surely such an AI would have some limitations, what you are saying seems like sweeping lemon juice out of a rock..    But again to your point, I might be thinking of it more like the horsemen in the 1900s.   This is a new concept, I would be curious to see how much success it has and the drawbacks as well.  Overall, a good read. I'm open to learning. #People call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us.#Computing power has increased dramatically over the last couple decades, while its relative cost has dropped. Likewise, data storage. This puts the compute and storage resources necessary for AI within the grasp of even small businesses. AI technologies make it possible to analyze enormous data sets much faster and more accurately than humans.  #How likely is it that Artificial Intelligence  will become smarter than humans and eventually take over and control humanity.#> and your take on the other types of data structures that might be out there, like the ‘canonicals’ mentioned in this article. Does AI need to be able to reason abstractly?   This is clearly an AGI question.   You should realize that the author of the principle college textbook on AI  (Peter Norvig) has said in public *""I don't want to build a human, I already have two.""*   Norvig was referring to his children.  The speedy-reasoning approach can be seen in the work on ""Atom Spaces"" in openCOG   https://wiki.opencog.org/w/OpenCogPrime:AtomNotation    See also  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_logic_network  Another example would be the Godel Machine of Schmidhuber, which contains a theorem solver which can overwrite itself.  http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/goedelmachine.html   "

We recently switched to Zabbix from Icinga, and I was really surprised that a feature like this was missing from an otherwise extremely well polished project.

AskAcademia;9my86e;1539167026.0;/r/AskAcademia/comments/9my86e/phd_student_im_supervising_wants_to_change/;PhD student I'm supervising wants to change project - any advice?;[deleted];"I think your annoyance and exasperation is understandable, but it has no place in the academic/lab setting  You voluntarily gave your time to answer her questions, but this was done with no strings attached  she is not forced to continue working with you and you shouldn't be angry about it. She is free to change subjects, with the respective cost of doing so (writing new proposal, starting over, working with someone not so helpful, etc). Plans are constantly shifting and people should adapt to it.  From a practical standpoint,  don't try to pressure her, as then she might do a half-assed job at your project, and it could be even worse, as you will have to be over her ass for things to get done. Similarly, don't be hostile towards her (telling her that ""she should just work on another project""), building a hostile environment in a lab is a terrible thing to do, and will make a disservice to your own mental health. Have a sincere and friendly conversation on what she would like to do, and from then onwards decide a polite course of action.  In academia we are constantly doing things that are ""rewardless"", we review papers anonymously , we take PhD students that might fail for random reasons (or go to industry, gasp!), we help colleagues with their questions, we answer anonymous questions in reddit, etc. At the end, you have to decide what are you willing to do, and accept the losses of doing so.  Take this as a lesson, next time try to waste less time with your students, for instance teach them find answers by themselves or limit the questioning time (hey, I have just 30 minutes, what would you like to ask?).  And be kind to her, remember she is just starting and she doesn't really knows what are the implications of what she is doing, how it affects you, how your time is going to be wasted, etc. She just wants to be happy and follow a fulfilling research path that is in accordance with her interests.#I agree she should talk with other members in the lab about their work.  But also the struggles they had getting their project to the point they are at.  Molly may have been going along with what the PI told her would be her project and didn't really think about what she wanted to do.  But since she's having so many troubles with cell culture, which is pretty basic thing in a wet lab, she could be feeling she can't do the project and is bailing before it gets even worse.  Now if she really wants to change her project, I would ask her want she wants to work.  The project question and basic design.  Similar to a PhD proposal but without all the experiments laid out.  Anytime I wanted to start a new project, my PI always made us come to him with the question laid out and a lit review already done.  This made us really know if that project was viable and gave him the info he needs to okay it or not.  But while you do this, you still have to keep working on the original project he gave you.  It's something to think about having Molly do if she wants to change her project.  Just handing her a new project may result in her bailing again when things get difficult.    I know you put a ton of time into training her and it would suck if she changed projects and left you with this one.  It may mean putting this back on the burner until other student comes that can help.  Depending on the project, it may make sense to have her work with other labmate who then gets all her questions.  #>If she changes project entirely, then I am so upset at the amount of time I ""wasted"" with Molly - not only just training her in the practical aspects, but also time spent answering the huge pile of questions.  That's a sunk cost fallacy. It's only been a few months. But if she continues, she'll be around for several years. Or worse, she'll drop the project cold turkey after another semester. Maybe you'll get a better suited and more interested student for this project and then training them won't take that much effort either and they'll produce better results.   Let her go. If she wants to continue in your group, make it clear that this is an irreversible decision and she can't switch projects another time. If she doesn't like whatever other project you come up with, she has to go to another lab. #I've often seen this with new students: after a few months, they're frustrated because ""their research doesn't work"". They're used to success, because experiments designed for teaching labs do work, and generally you can apply some ""recipe"" to get a good grade, and they have trouble handling what they see as failure when things become a little more difficult.  That's especially true for more ""bookish"" students, who receive good grades because of their theoretical knowledge but fail to adapt when more practical things are required, which seems to be Molly's case in your description. I'd try and tell her this, that it's normal that not everything works in the beginning, and that it's not failure, it's research. I always tell students at some point in their Ph. D. that if they didn't struggle with the research, then it wouldn't  be research. Nobody needs anyone to work on questions that solve themselves on the first try, they're often not scientifically relevant.   Now Molly seems to be quite immature and to be expecting a dream job where everything will always be perfect. If it were me, I'd tell her that there's no such thing as a dream project, as she seems to believe. In every project in every field of work there are boring moments, frustration and sometimes disappointment. But you need to overcome that of you want any kind of career. She's lucky enough to have a good project cut for her by you, many students would envy her. She'll likely be sorely disappointed if she thinks she'll do better with a project of her own. And then what will she do? Run away again at the first difficulty? (If she does that then her leaving is a blessing in disguise for you). You could also stress the fact that it puts you and the rest of the staff in a difficult position.  Those are the points I would try to convey if I were you. Of course I come off as harsh and if I had to tell someone this I would do it way more gently, but you get the idea.       #I am willing to bet she will get bored of a new project as well. When I was in my PhD I was also easily distracted from the hard slog of following through on projects by The allure of shiny new ideas. Until my advisor told me firmly no new projects until you have finished your old ones. And now I see the same thing in my students: Wanting to start new projects when the first project isn’t even near completed. And I feel comfortable insisting they follow through on what they started. If they do not enjoy the hard slog of completing research, it is better that they realize that sooner than later.#Time to get the PI involved? #Does the student have some low hanging fruit side project while she works up these cells? I find these difficult times much easier when I have a couple side projects I can move along. #>Molly joined and started her work in August.  It's really been 2 months. Sure, there was time invested before, but in the grand scheme of things when you act like there's a huge sunk cost here, on the time scale of a 5-6 year degree, it's not that much. Sure it's a big inconvenience to you, but it's her *entire life* for the next 6 years. Nobody should have to be in a place they're miserable for more than half a decade.   You should certainly try to encourage her and understand if there's something deeper that you just don't know about. Find out what about the practical work or literature she doesn't enjoy. Try to find if she has something in mind and understand why that appeals to her more than what she's working on (possibly there's rose-colored glasses toward something else and you might be able to dispell misconceptions). But don't trap her in something she hates and don't resent her for trying to be happy.#I would suggest applying encouragement. It could be that she feels uncertain about the difficulties in the lab, and is looking for reassurance.#I'm out of academia now and I would like to bring in a slightly different perspective. Essentially, in almost any job in the US there's freedom for the employee and the employer to end the contract. So anywhere you work, there's always a chance the employee will leave at an inconvenient time. Don't take it personally.  Your student has her reasons for leaving, and she has wasted some of your time, but she's also wasted her own time, so you have to accept her decision to move on from something that isn't working. It probably wasn't easy... it might be a mistake, but it's not your call to make.  You shouldn't take it personally but it's fine to be angry and frustrated. I had someone who took over a postdoc project I worked on who applied to a job at my current company. She had the interviews, we flew her out and put her up to meet everyone, we talked to our lawyer about immigration... in the end she said she couldn't take the job because it was in a different country. No shit... it was always in a different country... that was the job you applied for, interviewed for, etc, etc... that would never have changed. I'm still upset with her... she never even contacted me to apologize or explain anything.  And I just got word that someone who told us for three months that she was negotiating her resignation (taking a long time because she owned stock in the company) had changed her mind. That messes up a lot for many people in our office. What can I do, though?  Any way, it's a common thing. Don't take it personally. Hopefully you'll find someone new who will be interested.#Some of the other comments make me think of the Imposter Syndrome.  &#x200B   Would it be rude to bring that up? Not as an accusation but as a way to let her know that many people in academia experience it - if that is indeed a part of what is going on here.#There's two separate things here to address. One is your exasperation/frustration with this student, which has likely been building for a while, and two is the student switching projects.  It sounds like this student was genuinely leaning too heavily on you as a resource, and this is probably a good lesson to you on teaching someone how to find answers instead of giving answers right off. Really work through why you're frustrated. Lots of things in science feel like you're pouring your energy into something that always wants more, and you've likely worked through that feeling in the past with a project that required lots of late nights and still went nowhere. Why is this one getting to you?  Second is her switching. Right now you're sick of dealing with her and wouldn't mind her leaving, I get that, but that would do both of you a disservice. If I were you I would sit her down and try to work out exactly why she's finding this project unrewarding. If she worked through a lot of literature, she probably found it interesting at one point. How can you encourage her to rediscover what she liked about the project? Is she just discouraged by the lack of progress or has she been going along with what everyone wanted from her this whole time?   It might not be bad for her to have more than one project to work on, so that when something is failing on one she can still feel like she's making progress. Is there any way you can encourage her to split her time instead of dropping it entirely? Could she help with one of your collaborations as well as the project she was initially on?  Finally, consider trying to encourage her to start seeing a mental health professional now, rather than later. Grad school is stressful, and finding no joy in a project you used to find interesting enough to make it the core of your thesis is potentially an indicator of depression.#Doesn't this student have a thesis advisory committee?  At my institution, Grad students have to present their research plan in the first-year(ish) quals and then show the progress on that plan in every advisory committee meeting.  The PI and the advisory committee discuss and approve plans to deviate - this often happens (as when an avenue of investigation looked promising but turned out not to be).  Tell her to talk to the PI first - it is his/her decision, not yours (unless you are officially a Lab Manager). "

learnprogramming;9p5kcn;1539833493.0;/r/learnprogramming/comments/9p5kcn/how_ive_learned_how_to_shortcut_learning_an/;How I've learned how to shortcut learning an additional programming language;"Hi guys. Over the past 12 years of programming professional I've distilled a lot of my experience into logical steps to learn a new language quickly and thoroughly. I hope you get something useful out of this. If you have any questions let me know below.Here are 5 ways you get shortcut your learning process.* Use knowledge that you know from other languages* Nail down the fundamental knowledge* Resources that will help you learn fast* Find what you don't understand and work backwards* Try first, then ask# Use knowledge that you know from other languagesThe fastest way to learn a new language is to already know at least one. Use what you know from a previous language to learn a new one. For that I use, [http://hyperpolyglot.org/](http://hyperpolyglot.org/).What I love about hyperpolyglot is the table format comparing multiple languages. It's easy to see relationships between what you already know and how you'd implement them in the new language. Want to see how you'd do variable interpolation in Node.js, but you only know Python? No problem. Have a look at the reference sheet under ""variable interpolation"".Sometimes what you know in one language doesn't translate 1 to 1 to the new language. That's okay. Just learn the differences. For instance, in PHP you have class property visibility, such as ""private"", but in Python there isn't an exact translation. Private class properties in Python are denoted by an underscore or double underscore (which mangles the instance variables name). The manipulation of them are more left to convention. If a Python developer sees an underscore, they know that by convention they should avoid manipulating it directly, but nothing really stops them from doing so.**Added 10/18/18** Although transliterating one language to another is definitely an easy and fast route, each language has their own idioms which will force you to think in new ways. Idioms will also make it easy for other developers to quickly understand the code you wrote. That being said, if you learn something in one language there’s nothing wrong with implementing some flavor of it in the new language if it’s still concise and clearly understandable. For instance, JavaScript wasn’t intended to be a functional programming language, but it has language constructs such as functions as first class citizens that allows for it. Someone thought they’d try programming in the functional paradigm in JavaScript. It turned out just fine. This isn’t always true, but do what’s best for the project.We could go one step further and learn the differences between the languages. For instance, learning channels in Go for concurrency is pretty unique to the actual language, but the general concept of concurrency and shared nothing is pretty universal.## Nail down the fundamental knowledgeI think a lot of learning problems come from jumping into the deep end too early. They rush into coding, say for instance, from a tutorial without truly understanding the fundamentals.*Do not* skimp on the fundamentals. Yes, it can be a bit difficult to understand. Yes, it's not as fun as going straight into coding, but it will **shortcut** and **accelerate** your learning. It will, **reduce** your frustrations. When something doesn't work, you'll start to realize and **understand why**. Now please don't take it as me saying don't learn by coding. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying don't jump into coding while winging the fundamentals. Don't jump into learning Rails while ignoring learning Ruby. Don't jump into Vue.js without learning Javascript. Don't jump into Postgres without learning data modeling and indexes. Don't jump into writing an HTTP API without learning HTTP, TCP/IP, Caching, RPC, and REST.Understand variable scope before you use them, understand closures and its relationship to variable scope before you use them, understand generators before you write your own, understand promises and its association to asynchronous programming. If you skip these fundamentals in a language that has them, you'll see yourself often confused.## Resources that will help you learn fastThese resources will help you learn the basics of a language quickly:* [http://hyperpolyglot.org/](http://hyperpolyglot.org/) * [https://learnxinyminutes.com/](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)# Awesome EverythingA few years ago someone started curated links around certain languages and frameworks and posting them as repos on Github. I'm not sure who it was, but I am grateful to that person. If you've ever seen the icon on the left, you've undoubtedly experienced an Awesome List. There's pretty much a curated list for everything: CSS, React, Go, design patterns, scaling, big data, machine learning, and the list goes on. If you want to learn say Python, just go to Google and type in ""awesome python"". Try it now with whatever you're trying to learn: ""awesome \[PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE\]"". Sometimes there will be multi repos with awesome lists on the same topic, but perhaps with separate links. Pick and choose resources from those lists that help you learn fundamentals about that language.## Find what you don't understand and work backwardsHaving a particular difficulty? First, realize what you don't understand and that scope of it. Work backwards by diving deep into the fundamental concepts around the problem that you're having. For instance, if you are writing an anonymous function in a loop, you're trying to use a variable that's in the same scope in the anonymous function, but you see that it only ever uses the last value, learn what closures are and how they work. You'll learn that the anonymous function is actually a closure (not in all languages) and apart from having access to variables inside of the closure it also captures a reference to the variables outside of the closure. Learn more about closures in Javascript. Read as much as you need to to fully understand the problem you're going through.I find that reading as much code that I can, mostly open source repos on Github in the target language I want to learn, uncovers pretty much most things you need to know about the language. Find what you don't understand and work backwards as described above.## Try first, then askWhen trying to learn a programming language and anything else such as a framework or a paradigm, it is my opinion that you should try to make an effort to learn on your own first. There are plenty of resources available that you could search on Google that there's no excuse in this age of information, to not at least be able to find information first, read it, and try yourself.Now after trying on your own to learn you get stuck and not able to find information online that helps you get unstuck or you need fundamental knowledge that isn't anywhere, then go ahead and ask experienced people questions. This shows that you've done your homework and that you value their time. There are many places to find these experts: Slack communities in your particular region or ones around a particular topic, the trusty IRC channels, Reddit, forums, Gitter, and sometimes even Twitter.Keeping all of the above points will help supercharge your learning, not only in your beginning stages of learning an additional language, but throughout your career.If you liked this article, please share it with those that you think would benefit from it.As I've mentioned, if you have any questions around the learning process of learning a new language please let me know below.";\+1 for mentioning hyperpolyglot.

You had the great idea in the first place, you should run with it.  But here's my suggestion anyway (feel free to ignore)  Why not 2 options each month?  Fiction and Non Fiction?  There's not a TON of conversation about the books each post, I don't think it would be that confusing to have people discussing one of two potential options in the thread.    With an online book club, people are either interested in the book or they aren't.  If they aren't they aren't going to bite the bullet and read it anyway, they just aren't going to participate.    2 books, one Fiction and one Non-fiction.  I would expect this to encourage more participation in general, as opposed to a half/half situation where people who like one side will ignore the thread for the month when their side isn't up.#My only thoughts on the matter is it's good to see a non fiction representation, a bit of expanded thinking never hurt.#I have never read a nonfiction book for pleasure.

Hare>Most people are both repelled and intrigued by the images of cold-blooded, conscienceless murderers that increasingly populate our movies, television programs, and newspaper headlines. With their flagrant criminal violation of society's rules, serial killers like Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy are among the most dramatic examples of the psychopath. Individuals with this personality disorder are fully aware of the consequences of their actions and know the difference between right and wrong, yet they are terrifyingly self-centered, remorseless, and unable to care about the feelings of others. Perhaps most frightening, they often seem completely normal to unsuspecting targets - and they do not always ply their trade by killing. Presenting a compelling portrait of these dangerous men and women based on 25 years of distinguished scientific research, Dr Robert D. Hare vividly describes a world of con artists, hustlers, rapists, and other predators who charm, lie, and manipulate their way through life. Are psychopaths mad, or simply bad?

Can we get something with fiction? Most of these choices are just studies put inside of a book and expanded on #City of Thieves should be considered at some point  - Written by a man  - Masculinity is a big theme in the story  - Main characters are male  - Cyka blyat#Seriously who choses those books.  I looked up the second one and I don't like what I read about at all, it seems pretty faulty in it's science.#Storm of Steel is one of the better war memoirs I’ve read, and it stands out to me particularly among WW1 memoirs in not being poetically antiwar like Goodbye to All That or All Quiet on the Western Front, but Infantry Attacks by Rommel is a little better paced and more engaging. If anyone wants to experience something similar to those two, also check out Over There by Henry Evans, an American artillery officer. Also on my list are The Burning of the World by Hungarian infantry officer Bela Zomboric and a book sitting on my shelf aptly called Poilu which is an autobiographical account by a French infantryman.#Oh, hey. I read Junger's *Storm of Steel* about 6 years ago, and I picked it up again at a charity shop.   See, I always liked it, but fuck me sideways, Junger was a maniac. It makes an incredible contrast to Erich Maria Remarque's *All Quiet on the Western Front*, which depicts the trench warfare in all its' bloody misery. The big difference is, Junger served as a stormtrooper on the frontline, while Remarque didn't. *Storm of Steel* is autobiographical!  You bloody well wouldn't think that! Junger seems to revel in his accomplishments, describing injury, loss, and torment with equal detachment. I've heard some people call him a 'born soldier', but he seems to just never record his own emotional reactions. Descriptions of the Somme are factual observations, as are the burying of the dead, and the pain of his injuries.  It's a really good book, but it gets boring as fuck at times. Seriously, Junger manages to make an artillery bombardment sound like a shitty day in an underground shelter. His prose gets kinda flat, so after the first few chapters, I usually just weep and set it aside. Wouldn't recommend it as a binging book, but one you use to chill before bed or on the toilet.  It's one of those weird books that is authentically real, yet bucks expectations. I don't recall a single passage where Junger moralises or waxes lyrical about how terrible war is. His opinion seems to be 'I was there, this was what it was like, I had a job to do, I did it'.  Anyway, not an easy to read book, but definitely interesting.#These selections sound like interesting reads as far as my own personal taste goes, but I feel that they will have a hard time being picked up by a decent majority of the regulars here. I agree that perhaps there should be a fiction/non-fiction/wildcard kind of choice.  &#x200B   EDIT: lol at the near 3 way split#I don't know about these books but I'd highly recommend Unbroken. Outstanding book and personally made me think about how I face challenges in life. #I would like to recommend you replacing one of your choices with *Lonesome Dove*.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Lisk;9p6fwe;1539841579.0;/r/Lisk/comments/9p6fwe/liskecosystem_is_supporting_gny_project/;LiskEcosystem is supporting GNY project;Hi guys,&#x200B as  [u/John\_Muck](https://www.reddit.com/user/John_Muck) announced yesterday on reddit, [**LiskEcosystem**](https://twitter.com/LiskEcosystem) is supporting [**GNY HQ**](https://www.gny.io/) by signalling the intention to forge on the network.There are many reasons behind the decision. First of all, GNY already has experience in the field of machine learning, which is not a common thing these days, especially for ICOs. Most of the time, people have very less experience in the field they are starting to have their ICO, so this is a big plus. Also GNY team have developed a working product in the past, so the prerequisites are there, I would say.Speaking on a technological level, I really think that there is an immense potential for many fields by combining machine learning with blockchain and big data. Besides this, a big pain point in the blockchain industry is having a reliable cross chain protocol. Today there are two options at least for Bitcoin, the 2 way peg or by using lightning network.GNY tackle all these issues and I personally think that blockchain ecosystems in general would benefit from combining them with machine learning. By having a working Lisk Machine Learning within our ecosystem I can only say that we will have a big plus to offer for the projects interested to build on Lisk.As I'm personally quite interested into blockchain and machine learning technology, I decided to support GNY project and that is also the time for me to go to the next level.A more detailed view over the potential of combining blockchain with machine learning/AI and big data will come in as a blog post on medium. I will share it here, when is done.&#x200B Also don't forget to follow [**LiskEcosystem**](https://twitter.com/LiskEcosystem) on twitter and visit [http://liskecosystem.io/](http://liskecosystem.io/) from time to time to check the latest state of Lisk ICOs and tools.&#x200B Best!&#x200B &#x200B ;A little confused here... I see no issues with GNY proposing to forge on the Lisk network (becoming a standby delegate with the intention of getting enough votes to be a single slot within the 101 active delegates). A sidechain group actively forging on the mainchain, would actually be a good move and would ultimately benefit Lisk entirely. Is LiskEcosystem proposing to become a forging node on a GNY sidechain? If not, then why/how would LiskEcosystem 'support' GNY? - Perhaps I need to read the u/john_muck post to understand it better...

I wonder how that biased early research.;[deleted];The acronym WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic) was coined in reference to the bias believed to have been introduced into psychology by the heavy reliance on convenience samples of nearby college students used in psychological experiments.#It's likely it influenced Freud and co, because their approach to psychology was very philosophical without much concern for falsifiability. However, there was a psychologist who was around at the same time (potentially a bit before, but I'd have to check that) who were running experiments using the scientific method with basic statistical analysis.  So I think it depends on the school of thought.#The psychologist Carl Jung was greatly influenced by his trips to Africa. He writes about his experiences and his conclusions in Modern Man In Search of a Soul, and came to some interesting conclusions, attempting to dispel a lot of misconceptions at the time that whites were very different than blacks.   He comments on the superstitions of the Africans, which whites would find ridiculous, but then speculated that, provided with experiences that are out of the ordinary or unexplainable to us, an educated European would very quickly become just as superstitious.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/0156612062/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_FuqSBb23WEP3N

The old Enigma story shows what can (and will) be done to break cryptographic algorithms if the motivation is big enough. Back then, it was WWII and the threat of extinction. Today, it's control over the economy and information, which is probably the ultimate power. The governments deployed the brightest mathematicians and best resources to crack the codes. Today and tomorrow, they will deploy super computers, big data, quantum computers and AI together with advanced hacking infrastructure. It's going to take some heroic effort from the Monero project to stay on top of all this.;This is a good reminder.  We need to reflect on this every once in a while lest we get lost in the buzz of icos, black market shennanigans, fancy new mathematics named after fortnite dances, etfs and wtfs...    This is life and death.    Not just life and death for the individual members of our species who need it to escape oppressive regimes and to enjoy the basic sovereign rights that all humans deserve.    Neigh, in fact this is life and death for our entire species and known sentience in the universe.      Stephen Hawking, rest his memory, is gone.  So is John Nash.  So are countless other geniuses.  Our rarest spawns, they gifted us with a wealth of advanced discoveries in how we (as the universe) understand our own selves.    And if we don't get this cryptocurrency thing down, and transfer humanity onto a standard of value exchange that can't be corrupted by the whims of the short-sighted oligarchs... It will have all been for nothing.    We, and this entire planet will die.  All trace of our advanced discoveries and near singularly will tumble into the abyss and for fucks sake - it took hundreds of millions of years to get our saved game this far.    We may not (speaking as the universe as a whole) get another shot after this.  The conditions for a sentient space-faring species that develops cryptographic monetary standards are apparently so rare that we can't find evidence any other part of this universe has even gotten close.     So don't lose sight of what's important through our journey.    We're in this for the species, boys and girls.  We're in this for the entire sentient cosmos, and you can damn well bet the entire gaze of history and the wishes of all our ancestors are resting on our actions at this very moment.  Make it count. #Pretty neat. I’ve always wondered about an asic for brute forcing the keys to a bitcoin wallet. It would be expensive and it would take a ton of parallel computing power. But with a public blockchain like bitcoin actors know the value of the prize. So I pose the question:    1. Are there any single wallets valuable enough to create and implement an asic for this purpose?      This could be used for nefarious purposes to steal coins but could also be used for recovering wallets which contain large sums of lost coins for one reason or another (lost keys, forgotten passwords, broken hard drives, etc).

msp;9l5p6a;1538603167.0;/r/msp/comments/9l5p6a/are_we_proposing_azure_file_sync_over_fileservers/;Are we proposing azure file sync over fileservers yet? (Little humans big data);Edit: i took out my comments in regards to $$. Edit : The situation is described below but whats curious to me is if anyone has experience with azure file sync and if it would be appropriate for this scenario. Basically using it as a fileserver that downloads only needed data and keeps the rest in the cloud. A cloud based DAS in my opinion. Looking for insight, experience, suggestions, questions, comments and criticism:Situation:I’ve got a client who runs a newspaper with a circulation of ~20,000, with fewer than 15 active users. Due to the nature of their work, they’ve got about 4TB+ of media, are currently working off of a NAS along with a portable hard drive (connected to the owner’s PC) with even more data. These both are backed up with at the file-level to a cloud repo.We’ve recommended placing a server in their office to perform as a domain controller to centrally manage the users, and once we’re doing that- secure remote connectivity to their office with an RDS server and replace their NAS and other unmanaged data with a File Server.Two issues:We’re trying to tackle increasing (rather IMPLEMENTING) network security with this solution.Another major consideration is their data. They’ve got lots of data they use, need, access, share, etc. I’m looking at attaching a DAS to this server- effectively expanding this server to a super-large storage device, run this in a converged system placing the hypervisor on the server and all the VMs on the power vault, and either utilizing storage spaces or simply RAID.Assumptions:Based on our conversations with them, we’ve concluded internally (assumed, really) that this data is active, needed and wanted:• All their data is actively used and impossible to use an HSM tiering solution except for something that is purely automated. (Storage spaces creates a heat map every day and places frequently accessed data on the SSDs) I’m not just looking for tiering but I wish I had ground to assume a retention policy that can keep them (their data) small. I don’t believe that will be possible here.• This data is critical for the business to run. It’s hard for the IT Pro to pinpoint what kind of data will be needed for the next printed issue without input from users that are fully involved with that data. Getting this kind of information will be very difficult and most likely inconsistent and inaccurate since they don’t have policies or the manpower to provide this information.• They want to keep all their data and will refuse to implement a retention policy to delete old and unused data.Assumed Comparable Scenario:Studio/Photography/Marketing. Somewhere where you’ve got large files, lots of them, and not so many people.Cause for hesitation:Are these assumptions reasonable?Should they be specifically defined by client?I’ll add here that they’re not technical and have in the past explicitly let me know that they “don’t know, don’t care and hope that it’s good”. I would only push back and force them to make a decision if the impact of that decision has a financial factor.With so many ABCDEFGaaS flexible, fast and secure solutions available, is it completely OVERKILL to suggest physical corporate-grade hardware that will have to be professionally managed, serviced, and eventually replaced at the end of its lifecycle? The server along with the DAS approaches $20,000 and will require an additional purchase for a backup solution. I’ve been looking at Azure File Sync but on the flip side- why tie my client in to a monthly and expensive solution as opposed to the DAS which might require just setup and minimal maintenance?;"$25k for a server is outrageous for 15 users, why is it so high?   Supermicro or Norco 24 bay 2.3"" drive with SAS expander and nice hardware RAID card set to RAID10 (or 6 if speed isn't much issue).  You can run 22x4TB drives for data and 2x240 or 500GB Flash drives, with everything else should put you well under 10k with server licensing and everything else.  Setup Veeam B&R server with cloud connect repository for a couple hundred a month and you're set.  #Dude, there are plenty of good servers that have 12 or more drive bays.  Add in a good RAID card, and a fast tier (smallish SSD) for VM boot disks and a slow tier (they don't need anything more than SATA or 7.2K SAS disks for this) for storage.  With current disks you can easily do 20TB or more in a single server without dealing with external connections to other devices.#Would like to hop on this thread with my question, per favor.  I got a little bit lost with all the options here.  \-------------------->  What do you think is the best solution then?  My customer has 5 sites and about **14TB** in their File server.  It feels like staying with an on-premise solution is the best thing.  Having a local file server and backup with Windows shadow copy or similar.  What do you reckon?  Ta!#Tailor maid for Datto NAS. I just implemented a 6tb Datto NAS for a newspaper that sounds uncannily like what you just described. #Have you looked at SharePoint + OneDrive? The new sync client on 1803 with on-demand files is pretty fantastic.   That may allow you to take care of the file share needs and shift some of the budget towards the security initiatives."
tmobile;9n24dm;1539196251.0;/r/tmobile/comments/9n24dm/tmobile_suffers_too_much_of_a_good_thing/;T-Mobile suffers too much of a good thing;A couple years ago I switched to TMO because the taxes & fees included pricing. And their data speeds actually were pretty good at work. Which sadly is where I spend most of my time. Even though the company I work for have contracts with AT&T and Verizon. AT&T seems to have some sort of repeaters or DAS, as their speeds are nothing spectacular but usable. Verizon must have a full on antenna array as panel antenna can be seen all over the place (It's a big building). And as soon as you walk in you get full bars and over 50 Mbps speeds with Verizon.    But many must of caught onto to the price point and usable speeds of TMO as now they seem to be suffering from congestion during normal work hours, full bars but dismal speeds. And then after hours speeds return to what I was getting when I first joined TMO. Heck, a couple coworkers in my immediate work area recently made the switch to TMO. But either of them are big data hogs.   Oh well, I'll keep on with TMO for a time. But I suspect nothing will be done to improve the congestion in this area. TMO sure have been racking up the customers but at the cost of degraded data services at times. ;They seem very stingy with DAS deployments and rely way too much on macros.#It ebbs and flows. Technology improves, and people hop on. And one of the side effects may be congestion.  I totally know what you're talking about. I think with the sprint merger and deployment of 5G, itcan help with that congestion...until the numbers get too high and there may or may not be issues with congestion. Again. Lol  Wait it out, if you can! It only gets better from here.  I feel you, boo. #I must be lucky.  T-Mobile has done nothing but improve in Phoenix, AZ over the course of the last three years I've been with T-Mobile. I get and still get three to four times the speeds I used to get on Sprint and I average 18-70 down, depending on location. Coverage is everywhere I go. Hell, my iPhone 5 which is 4G only on T-Mobile gets 10-12 down on 4G.  Sorry about your congestion issues. I did 16 years with Sprint so I know your pain.#Just a thought. Why dont you use your office's Wifi while at work? I mean Im not debating about the congestion, but I always wonder why people dont do this. #I'm finding out that more and more of my immediate co-workers have switched to T-Mobile. Making more sense as to why speeds have gone down.  #[deleted]

If you are getting multiple rejections the common factor might just be you and how you present yourself. #Reading this post, it's hard to sympathize with you.  First off, as a non-degree'd developer, let me just say that your military experience is not a replacement for a CS degree.  Nobody is jealous of you. Sorry man, most of us who went into tech don't give two shits about the military. This is a mostly left-leaning industry where military experience grants you 0 brownie points anywhere that matters.  As for your failure to get selected, this will always either be your lack of technical skills/experience or your personality. Judging by your post, I would say probably the latter, but considering your arrogance, I won't rule out the former either.  Amazon is a Big N.

I wouldn't want to work with you either.#[deleted]#Military veteran with no degree here. Currently working as a swe at a tech company. From my experience, ive always felt that i got preferential treatment as a veteran. Military experience is not a degree so stop comparing them and no one is jealous of us being veterans. Stop whining and go apply to other companies.   #I would say it’s your superior attitude that puts people off. And the paranoia that is so apparent in this post probably does not help either. You think you are better than everyone else because you have served. That may be true, but those who you look down on (and assume malicious intent to) will decide if they want to work with you or not. And if your attitude does not change they will not want to. It’s that simple. You don’t respect them and they can feel it. And if they have to decide between someone friendly and you, guess who they will select. #There is a lot that's unknowable here. I can conduct a mock interview on $VOIP_SERVICE_OF_YOUR_CHOICE and give you feedback, if you'd like? Let me know...#Based solely off this post, you come off as somebody who feels entitled and blames other people for their problems.   >Jealous about not having served in their youth, and now regretting that decision.   You also demonstrate a poor understanding of other people. Do you really think a bunch of tech nerds wish they were in the Marines? I feel like you convinced yourself that this is true.#people are being unnecessarily hard on you here. But I agree with them that there is no proven equivalence between 4 years enlisted and an engineering degree.  They both have their ""not a lot of people can do this"" spotlights. I would probably cry and/or pee my pants if a drill sergeant was screaming in my face, or I had to get up at 04:30 and run 5 miles (or had to deal with an actual crisis, like, you know, enemies shooting at me). A lot of jarheads can't get past basic arithmetic, let alone algebra, calc, or trig. Let alone learn how to code, or write a coherent essay. And of course there are people who have done both, and that is you.  Personally, I think more employers *should* treat 4 years' service the same as a degree, simply because both are proof that someone stuck with something challenging and completed it. That's 99% of what a degree does. It distinguishes people who can ""pass the test"". The test isn't perfect, and degrees have a whole fucking slew of things wrong with them, but they serve their purpose. Service, however, has a huge difference in that it's *compensated*, whereas most of us have to *pay* for school and it's goddamn expensive. So bottom line it's the employer's discretion if they want to treat 4 years armed forces as a degree, and I wish they would.  As for discrimination, that's a very specific civil law matter. And if you really feel that strongly about it, I suggest you get an anti-discrimination attorney and have him/her monitor your applications and interactions with employers. If *they* see bona fide discrimination, they can leverage very powerful federal laws that will either force them to hire you, or allow you to collect a princely sum as a penalty for overlooking you.#\> So, now, I sometimes notice clearcut discrimination from companies despite all of this experience/skills.  &#x200B   That could easily be a lot of other things, too.  &#x200B   \> Strangely enough, a lot of the people whom I experience this from appear to be jealous for whatever reason. Jealous about not having served in their youth, and now regretting that decision.  &#x200B   Assuming it's jealousy also seem hasty.  Why would people who already have cushy tech jobs be jealous?  &#x200B   \> I have all of the requirements they're asking for, references & certifications however I constantly receive a ""Not Selected"" status. Why?  &#x200B   It could be your personality or many other things.  Maybe there's better candidates for the job - a lot of people seem to not realize they are weighted against other candidates, that's it's not an 'all checkboxes checked and you're in' thing.  Maybe you come off as too gung-ho or too much of a drill sergeant.  Who can really say?  It's really easy for other people to read others wrong.  I've gotten soft-balled by people before and it sucks, but I can't honestly say it had to have been discrimination.  &#x200B   You could find someone who will do an interview and give you honest feedback about everything.#Basically your entire post is a rant without any substance. You bring up your 'veteran' status while it is in fact **completely irrelevant**. You're just assuming you didn't get hired because you're a veteran. You don't know. This bit on the other hand shows why you didn't get hired:  > Jealous about not having served in their youth, and now regretting that decision. The other half involves some sort of (1) astonishment at my knowledge/skillset/experience, (2) jealousy, and (3) gatekeeping.  You didn't get hired because you're an asshole. Plain and simple. The people you got interviewed just smelled it a mile away. #I am a veteran with a degree (software engineer) with 20 years experience and I can tell you that you will be discriminated against in the workplace.   If I could do it over again I would leave anything about being a vet off of a resume and not discuss it on interviews.   You may be able to get in the door of a company (and they can check a box and get a tax break) but where I work vets go to the back of the line for promotions behind women and minorities.

So now I try helping my girlfriend see gradients. It's in the grey are that I think people can find genuine relief. However I also do not believe in giving meaningless advice. So I do not tell my girlfriend to just feel better for the sake of feeling better. Reasons for feeling better must be grounded in things that deliver efficacy.The above chart does a few things. First, it turns Epilepsy from a big unwieldily monster that hides in the dark into manageable stages that can be worked on. By staging things, it becomes less scary. Working on multiple stages is easier and also has a synergistic effect. This defeats the idea that a silver bullet is needed and anything less is worthless. Second, it shows how defeating earlier stages prevents later stages.I believe framing is important when discussing problems. Framing allows us to view wins and defeats differently. For example most people want to address problems at stage 1. However if problems could be addressed at stage 2 or stage 3 , then even though Epilepsy is not solved, you are effectively treating the issue and can have significantly quality of life improvements. But let's suppose stage 2 or 3 aren't applicable, then you have stage 4. The probability of someone somewhere in the world solving some stage is high, even if it's not the lowest possible stage.When it comes to technology I'm an optimist. I work silicon valley and I see new tech all the time. I strongly suspect that things like big data will create hugely impactful solutions at stage 2 and 3 in the next 5 years.I know some people are in the deepest darkest well of despair. And I know that in such a place the above chart will come across as asinine advice. This too is how my girlfriend reacted at first, but then she gradually opened up about trying new solutions. So I do not mean to act like this solves your problem. But if it helped my girlfriend, perhaps it can help others.I will provide links to some things in the list.[\[04\] Epistemic device](http://www.epistemic.com.br/)[\[05\] RNS/VNS Device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFlsk8pnmho)[\[06\] Ribcap](http://www.ribcap.ch/)**UPDATE 10/9/2018:**Made some changes based on comments and new thoughts.[https://imgur.com/pZPVmoQ](https://imgur.com/pZPVmoQ)&#x200B ";"There's one main thing I think you should change: Medication is NOT A BAD THING.

Iota;9l2ztw;1538586025.0;/r/Iota/comments/9l2ztw/cloud_computing_vs_blockchain_vs_iota/;Cloud Computing Vs Blockchain Vs Iota;"So cloud computing is a thing. What is it used for? A lot of things! File Storage  Email  Blogging  Website Hosting  Disaster Recovery (offsite records don't burn)  Moving data between jurisdictions (bulletproof hosting)  Big Data  Advertising Servers  CPU/GPU intensive applicationsNow, of all of these applications, the only one that cannot be truly replicated by blockchain + local software is CPU/GPU intensive applications. If you want to make an ecommerce site, go for it! You can have all of the data hosted on the blockchain, and when you take a payment you pay in ether, and a smart contract notifies the shipper, and an escrow agent and everything just happens. The only problem is that blockchain grows. And grows. And grows. Until like a cancerous tumour it has grown to completely fill your hard drive. Now into this fray steps Iota. Iota can do everything that blockchain can do, but it can also handle cpu and gpu intensive applications through qubic. It can take the very best parts of cloud computing- the access to raw industrial computing powerhouses, and combine that with the best parts of blockchain- smart contracts and decentralization.But after that, the tangle- the fundamental foundation of iota actually shows promise for so much more. Just like bitcoin and ethereum are simply apps that live on blockchain, so too Iota is simply an app that lives on the tangle. It is the first tangle app, and that makes it special. However, there are innumerable use cases where the tokens represent not value, but physical objects. There are also use cases where the traded tokens are stablecoins that fluctuate with the real world value of national currencies. &#x200B some project ideas:  A DAI forex exchange (but on iota) In this exchange, no traditional cryptocurrencies are traded. The ONLY cryptocurrency that is traded is Iota. The rest of the currencies are DAI style cryptocurrencies that are pegged through the DAI methodology to the price of national currencies. The market itself has a 0% charge for market makers, and a .025% for market takers, capped at 25 miota. An Escrow and Item registry. You can register any serial number as a token, and record a description of that item, including a picture of the item. If the item is electronic, and has any electronic lock system or encryption system, the token that represents that item contains a set of methods to use a recorded lock or encryption key to activate the device. Transferring the token transfers ownership. As such, atomic swaps of sale could be performed, such that you could buy (and legally own+control) a car without ever having seen the owner, signing papers, or taking any action aside from dealing with the sale. In the marvel movies in the ironman vs hulk fight [https://youtu.be/FdWJ-Njeaig?t=3m](https://youtu.be/FdWJ-Njeaig?t=3m) tony stark asks an AI ""how quickly can we buy this building?"" as he throws the hulk into it. Notice that ownership of the structure is assumed to be transferred to him on the fly. This is what object tokenization allows for, except in the real world. Point, click, buy. But more importantly, it allows you to place buy and sell orders on all kinds of objects. Ever need to sell your car? Many people have ""For sale"" signs sitting out on their vehicles. In the future, people can register their vehicles at point of ownership, and the instant they feel like they want to sell their vehicles, they look for all of the buy offers that other people have placed on their vehicle. Dealership AI's, AI's run by normal people wanting to buy a car, and so forth. The deal is finalized, and the other person comes to take possession of it. No papers signed, no weeks of For Sale signs, nothing. Just one and done boom it's sold.

What I don't see is discussions about the Mosaic Effect and big data. This is where one data set has a data element, another data set has a second data element, and so forth. With enough different datasets one is able to put together enough information to determine information about a person that they are actually not entitled to see. #Turns out that data, particularly *easy access* to data, is very, very valuable indeed.  Decades ago information gathering wasn't really a big deal. Your answers would go on a slip of paper, into a box, and stored in a warehouse. The only time anybody bothered to put the effort in to find that slip of paper was if there was a very compelling reason to spend time and money on investigating *you*.  But now data collection is near-zero cost - and correlating historical information about you from nearly infinite sources is also near-zero cost. Which means you have NO privacy any more - and worse than that - you can be targeted purely based on your data, not because *you* were a person of interest.  Everybody wants your data - from insurance companies who want to push the odds in their favour, to pharmaceutical companies that want to target susceptible people with fear campaigns to buy their products, to governments who want to fine/tax you more because they can, to hackers who want to impersonate you for any of a million purposes - they all want to store everything about you so they can automatically come to any conclusions they want.  So - your data is *valuable*. What do politicians, companies, and countries do when there's something valuable for the taking? They legislate it, they steal it, they demand it, they threaten you for it.  If history tells us anything - our data is going to become like any commodity - raped and pillaged. And there's nothing we can do about it. Except die and hope our data doesn't fuck our children for generations to come - which it almost certainly *will*.

bigdata;9lzdia;1538858649.0;/r/bigdata/comments/9lzdia/data_lake_questions/;"""Data Lake"" Questions";Hello Big Data Gurus - Kind of got into a project wherein the manager wants to create what is being referred to as a 'data lake', but really doesn't have any semi-structured or unstructured data in it, just plenty of relational data.  One of the peculiarities here is that data aggregators upstream have the ability to modify data attributes that *should* be unmutable, and when this data gets tweaked, my clients can face regulatory concerns with 'bad data', when in fact, it was a function of data being changed outside of their control.  Given that, the client would like to understand how common this is and be able to report on instances of change. So what was described to me as a desire was to take a snapshot every day of pertinent data and put it into a 'data lake'.  To my reading of the available literature, a little bit of a different beast than what most people are doing when they say data lake, but I can see the rationale.  But it seems like we'd have to do some level of manipulation to get here  i.e., I'd need at the minimum to add new random keys and datetime options to any affected tables so as to allow for uniqueness and date grained discrimination at report time.  Again, kind of violating the 'just put the raw data in there' idea that I have generally seen associated with a data lake.  This shop is running sql server 2008 though migrations to 2016 are possible for this component of the project if I understand correctly.  They are a fully vertical MS shop creating an ETL solution with SSIS / stored procedures if that is of any help.  Their existing databases are on premise, though I have asked people to kick the tires on the feasibility of moving this component to a cloud environment (probably azure).  All of that being said, does anyone here have any insight for me on similar efforts?  What went right, what went wrong, the right architecture, etc?  I would be very appreciative.Thanks! ;"Have you seen temporal tables https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/temporal-tables?view=sql-server-2017#>  the manager wants to create what is being referred to as a 'data lake'  That's a problem.  When the manager tells you what the solution will be rather than providing requirements and letting you determine the best solution to meet those requirements, you're going to end up building the wrong thing.  Collect the business requirements for what they need and how they will use it, THEN determine the best solution to meet those requirements.    Who is the upstream and how do they send their data to you? Do they send a daily file?  Is it a complete file or just the records which have changed since the previous file?   #I think the problem is that ""data lake"" is more of a marketing than technical term - just like ""data warehouse"" before it.  So, management wants a data lake since they've heard of that, and it's easy to get it funded. But Data Lakes tend to have very little validation, transformation, and curation.  Many people describe them as a dumping ground where users make sense out of raw data at query time.    As you've discovered there are many challenges in addressing data quality problems post-load in a Data Lake that supports schemaless data.  I'd suggest getting more ideas from Data Warehousing - where heavy validation, transformation, curation, deltas & versioning, and auditing are the rule rather than the exception.  A few more suggestions:     * Use an ETL process to manage data, schema consistency, auditing, etc.  If you have programmers then I'd write a custom one, rather than using SSIS/pentaho/informatica/etc, but only after doing a research on what works best.    * Versioning: you don't need a *temporal table* to manage data versioning - since data warehouses have been doing it for 25 years.  You just need a diff process and a timestamp that's part of your primary key.    * Original value columns: can be stored on regular production tables and make it easy to see rejected/modified values.    * Quality level - every row should be tagged with a quality_level that identifies how bad its issues are.  There should be a way to decompose all quality problems with any given row - whether via audit tables, logs, or columns that can be expanded for analysis.    * Raw & transformed tables: keep both if you can afford to    * Auditing tables: that keep track of records in & out of each step, as well as reject reasons    * Idempotency: You should be able to reload data - using new transform rules, perhaps handling changes to interpretation of incoming data without producing duplicate data.  This often involves diffing data, and some kind of batch_id that can tie the data to a prior data set, extraction, etc.  #I'm guessing there aren't project managers, or they aren't being allowed to gather requirements.   Terms are a flippant thing, but knowing what you should build is [half the battle](http://jp2.r0tt.com/l_edff8ce0-78a5-11e1-85a7-b54c7b500002.jpg). #The trick here is to monitor change in schema each schema of data has incremental version number. Now views are coming created on top of all these table versions to get the latest data aka snapshot."

Blockchain 3.0 will not only change the traditional relationships in an economic system, but also will overturn old classical economic system, and rebuilding world’s economic structure. The current change will make most crypto tokens obsolete.At the end of 2016, Tomi Wen, CEO of Beijing Digital Engine Technology Co. Ltd. and the founder of DBXChain, chose to get into blockchain market by working on the underlying system of public chain, data infrastructure in the blockchain world. Tomi Wen holds a bachelors degree from Renmin University, and is a tech geek. He developed software DIY-Page at age 15 and became “the software author that made Baidu changed its algorithm”.With DBXChain, Tomi aims at exceeding Ethereum and becoming the first large-scale feasible public chain by introducing the first public blockchain with real business use cases and projects integrated already before listing its token DBX on any exchange. For Tomi this is a statement about validating DBXChain as a credible blockchain among the so called “archaic blockchain”.“Archaic blockchain” refers to the projects that do not have real operations as support, but simply aim at attracting people to invest by issuing cryptocurrency. This became known after a recording was published where a prominent Chinese investor in the field revealed that many blockchain companies have no valid business goals. In the archaic blockchain era, majority of the projects are “illusions”, so that everyone swindles other people’s money. The recording event marks the end of “archaic blockchain” age. The new age of blockchain belongs to practitioners, not braggers. This kind of game will be aborted eventually. In the new age of blockchain, those people who work with technological and business progress in mind way will win.DBXChain has not only their blockchain testnet already available, but it wants to introduce an ecosystem that allows for true decentralisation. DBX’s main goal is to provide unprecedented blockchain products or services to redefine data exchange ecosystem. This new value-based ecosystem is a decentralized community that provides a platform for users to explore and exchange data. This exchange process is safe and users are able to own their data with rights.A decentralized ecosystem is able to attract interested investors and developers. DBXChain uses a consensus mechanism D-DPoS that they spent more than a year developing. It has two key features: first, transaction capacity is greatly improved by a representative system and sharding technique so that it meets the requirement to make an application feasible. Second, security issues, due to oligarchy and centralization by a representative system, are solved by using a real-time fluid “super role” to replace regularly elected “super nodes” and by balancing the importance of subjective choice and objective contribution in an election mechanism.DBXChain’s main business is data infrastructure that releases data’s value and “atomizes” data transactions. A connection that were impossible to release value has been made possible in a new blockchain operation system. Artificial intelligence (AI) will also benefit the ecosystem from big data accumulation and better computing powers.DBXChain aims to build a business model that emphasizes on revenue from applications. DBXChain will support many developed businesses, which already have a large volume of data on classical internet. These data will test the capacity of DBXChain networks and its security.For example, DBX will offer a convenient data sharing tool in the form of DApp so that users are able to share their data with public selectively and voluntarily while keeping their privacy. For example, the popularization of mobile payment has generated massive transaction data. Users can share their transaction data by uploading screenshots of receipts voluntarily. This way users actively choose if they want their data to be collected. Additionally, these data might be used by many different parties with users’ authorization: a financial institution needs to sell credit products  a market research group wants to understand consumption. User get benefits every time data are used.DBXChain is also in cooperation with the app SuperFans. SuperFans allows stars/celebrities to connect to their fans by decentralized communications achieved by DBX. It reduces the costs of communication between stars and fans and explores more interesting and effective business models for fan economy such as more personalized fans service and engagement etc. It shows a possibility of blockchain reforming future entertainment economy.By the end of 2018, DBX aims to have 50 projects available online that goes beyond finance field. DBX has been actively developing projects in the fields of game, social, IoT, AI etc.;I think it is necessary to mention that the team works really herd to update their social networks. There are a lot of information not only about the project, but so other interesting information #As far as I understand, the team presented a technically rather complicated project which is based on its own file structure, am I right? #What are the distinctive features of this project? I want to know why such a large number of participants join the project? How is it useful to people?

cscareerquestions;9nqxfn;1539403023.0;/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9nqxfn/a_senior_colleague_of_mine_compared_programming/;A senior colleague of mine compared programming to Ruling over a country..;"So, I don't get along at all with this guy at work. I have less than 1 year of experience and he has over 20 years. He is objectively the smartest person in the team. Holds a masters degree in Mathematics from Cornell. Everytime there is any sort of issue in the team, the team lead asks him for his advice. He is legitimately one of the smartest person I know. He is horrible at communication though. Like me he is not a native English speaker. He is barely audible, he hates repeating himself. Starts screaming, when confronted. His plans are pragmatic but less glamorous. I like glamorous technologies, I like big data stuff.  He hates big data technologies. All in all, what he says makes sense, yet it is not immediately obvious what his plans are, but if I give it sufficient time, his plans become clear to me.Every now and then, I feel bored with what I am doing and defy him and involve Apache spark in the project or use X technology/library to solve a problem when it is not needed. Most of the people in my team have at least 10 years of experience and I am the youngest person in this team. Everyone in the team detests me for it. They have been very vocal about it. My team lead likes the fact that I am pulling all the new technologies into the team. He even wrote about it in my latest performance review. His words were ""One of the advantages of having him on the team is that he likes to try out different technologies and challenge established order. But he also needs to realize that once a decision has been made, he has to stick with that decision even if he doesn't like it"".Now, about a week ago, I got into major trouble with him. My team primarily deals with Python and we inherited a Java code base from some other team. We had to integrate that code base into out systems. I was told to write a Python wrapper for it, using command line to invoke it. I really felt it was a bad idea and modified the code base and made it write directly to the entry point service. My team lead was okay with this and two other guys in the team were okay with it too. Even my team lead's boss was okay with it too. But this guy lost his shit and started screaming at me, told me that I need to be open minded and listen to other people's ideas. He went on to say that he has been doing this job for 20 years and he went through all these phases of experimentation and learnt these patterns that could streamline the development process.. etc.. etc.. His argument was that what he was suggesting would take 1 day at most, would be fairly easy to maintain, but what I did took me more than a week and a half and if there is any problem with the inherited code base, it wouldn't be obvious if the code I introduced caused the problem or if it is generally a bug in that code base itself.I kind of felt offended by the way he said it, but I can understand why he is angry and I do agree with him. He told me an interesting analogy, where he compared a server farm with a country. Each server is like a state in a country and we have to look after the memory, cpu time disk space etc., He says that in 2018 a lot of these things are automated, but we he started programming he had to be aware of the internals of a lot of systems. To become a good ruler, you have to study the methods of previous kings, understand the culture, actively try to gain experience.From today, I candidly want to put an effort to become better at my craft. I want to become more pragmatic like him. To this end, can someone recommend me books, articles, blogs, youtube channels that I should be actively reading/watching? Anything from software design to performance tuning to security! I want to diversify and deepen my knowledge. I have a masters degree in Computer Science, so I can handle fairly complicated material.";"There's a fine line between pushing the envelope and trampling all over institutional culture. I think you're doing important things for them, but I suggest working on your ""soft skills"" so you can get more of the entrenched personnel on your side than against you.  ""We've always done it this way"" is certainly toxic, but you also need to pick your battles, yes?  I've heard good things about the book ""Soft Skills for Programmers,"" but I haven't read it myself.  Good luck!#I don't agree with him screaming at you, but from the limited information I have, I agree that the last thing you want to do is modify the Java code base unless absolutely necessary. I would avoid doing that at all costs. I'm assuming the Python wrapper in this case would communicate to the Java code base by running it and reading/writing data from stdio.  If something was wrong with that Java code, you'd want to be able to blame the other team for it, by saying that you never even touched it. Plus its Java. Once you modifiy the code base, you're kind of taking ownership of it.#You can always learn from these guys...#There's nothing grizzled old dudes love more than sharing their personal wisdom with you. If you can figure out how to get him talking in that ruling over a country vibe whenever you get a chance I promise he'll like you more and you'll get along better and you'll probably learn some stuff.  The fact that you wrote this in a way that pays service to both of your viewpoints in an emotional situation already puts you ahead of 95% of people imo. Whatever you do will probably be on the right track.  I know you asked about books and we're all kind of ignoring that, but whatever.#> Every now and then, I feel bored with what I am doing and defy him and involve Apache spark in the project or use X technology/library to solve a problem when it is not needed.  > My team lead likes the fact that I am pulling all the new technologies into the team. He even wrote about it in my latest performance review.  I strongly dislike when people do this. That new hotness you're importing is shit I have to deal with in 2 years when no one knows how it works and you got bored and moved to a new job. If there is a compelling reason to use something, then use it. But you being bored is not a compelling reason.  Angry guy is very likely correct on this.  >  I was told to write a Python wrapper for it, using command line to invoke it. I really felt it was a bad idea and modified the code base and made it write directly to the entry point service.  I no care, I do what I like is not acceptable in a professional setting. If there is a agreed upon design, then you should do that. If you disagree with the design, then propose a new design and get it signed off on. Angry guy is correct on this.  > My team lead was okay with this and two other guys in the team were okay with it too. Even my team lead's boss was okay with it too.   They were okay with it as in they don't care you can do what you want, or they agreed that your proposal was a better solution? There's a pretty vast difference between the two. Angry guy is likely correct on this.  > Starts screaming, when confronted.  This is not acceptable from angry guy.#Book recommendation: The pragmatic programmer. I'm still reading it, but it's pretty good so far.#Whether or not he's toxic or you're toxic or he has bad soft skills or you have bad soft skills or whatever, the fact that he's sitting down and giving you this talk means that he wants you to improve.  He doesn't want to play games and fuck with you, he just wants you to listen.  I've been in situations like this before and they're a fantastic chance to consciously change your behaviour.  They will notice if you do this and the level of respect from your colleagues will improve dramatically.  If the old guy really is good at his job and you want to continue the relationship and get mentorship from him, first thing you should do on Monday is tell him that he was right.  Next time you have a crazy idea, ask him whether he's tried doing something similar in the past.  You don't have to agree with everything he says but you do need to respect his experience and listen to everything he has to say.  It's easier to spend 30 minutes talking about it than a week and a half implementing it then realising it's bad."

Over the months, I taught myself a new programming language and build a working prototype of a program that intelligently finds data, ingests it, transforms it, and models it.  In theory, the output would be useful either to businesses or investors in those businesses to make them sweet, sweet $$$$.&#x200B Problem is, I didn't follow a cardinal rule of startups: I didn't identify a problem and build a solution for it. I have no actual proof that anybody even wants this service/product/whatever. So I've hit a point where I don't know a way forward because I don't know what anyone wants it to ultimately do.&#x200B My question is how do I find the right people to talk to about what they're looking for and what I can do for them. How do I move past the ""Does anyone want this?"" stage and get a solid answer to that question? Do I find a mentor? A professional representative? Do I just start cold calling someone? And who?&#x200B What's my game plan from here?";The reason you are supposed to find a problem then make a solution is that there is a much better chance of success that way. Hopefully, you enjoyed learning the programming language and building the prototype and learned something transferrable from doing that.   You might be able to push forward here but you are going to have to get lucky and spend a whole bunch of time marketing and interacting with people to find those in need of your solution. It's hard to say whether a mentor would help or if you should reach out to groups, if you should launch and offer the output, if you should try selling the tool or if you should ally with a company without specific information about the product.

And that requires data-exchange.First of all, for all current applications and services, data plays important role to conduct data analysis and make business decisions. Investment banking staff have to know the financial data of the IPO company  a luxury brand has to collect data showing by how much proportion household spent their income on luxury goods. All industries are surrounded by data, we can not live without data support. Beyond the need for Data to conduct business, the very technical aspects of applications and services involves the management and exchange of data. Hence, to allow Blockchain to compete against current systems, but most of all to be able to integrate and functions with these systems  data-exchange will need to be in its core.The essential spirit of DBXChain is data. No matter the future applications, the already launched “Data Game”, or the ecosystem community in the final step, all those functions are data based.However, it does not stop there. The reason why DBX wants to build up a public chain which main focus is data is that traditional systems and services have major shortcomings in their way of managing big data that neither are fair to data suppliers, nor efficient to data demanders.Let’s discuss this further.**The need of Blockchain in Data**How Data has been access, stored and shared in the classical internet & Big Data industry have almost been in the form of oligopoly. Data of you is used by big internet companies to generate huge amount of profit without your control. For example, Facebook can collect and export all data about you from your interactions on their platform. However, you are not able to get any reward by providing your information or data to Facebook. In fact, your information could be used by so many companies for different types of purpose through variety of ways without your consent.Additionally, there are several conundrums existing in the traditional data exchange approach. In macro point of view, the supply side is much heavier than the demand side. Tons of data, in so many ways, are generated second by second in our daily life but people in a certain industry might only need a small section of the whole data, leaving the remaining part aside. This is no doubt a kind of data waste, namely we do not utilize the data fully or effectively. Among different types of data, it lacks of logic to connect each type of data, resulting more and more data islands.Furthermore, traditional systems have great issues with data precipitation. Data precipitation refers to the issue of an original data supplier inability to benefit from any following transaction on his data. Imagine three people A, B and C, try to trade data between each other. A owns the data demanded by B and C. Initially, B comes to A and successfully purchases data. Then, he extracts the specific data section he needs just as to precipitate the data of A, and forms his own data with a more attractive charge. In this way, C could naturally go to B instead of A, the original data supplier, to trade. After purchasing data from B, C precipitates the data one step further and trade with other people, which has nothing to do with A and B. In such business model, every intermediate trader tends to precipitate the data and the original data supplier cannot benefit from any following transaction on his data.However, Blockchain, characterized by its decentralized encrypted and open spirit, serves as an ideal solution to the problems existing in the big data industry. DBX Foundation, as a leading public chain company in the blockchain industry, is established just in order to solve the puzzles mentioned above. DBXChain provides unique distributional data storage on its side chain and data analysis and computing online service to satisfy specific need of companies from different industry, which is not quite available by other blockchains. On DBXChain, you can find whatever data you ask but also be able to analyze the data. DBXChain will will let data owners benefit themselves by their data  a more advanced data exchanging approach which could target at certain section/field of data  and an incentive mechanism to stimulate data owners to keep participating in exchanging their data on DBXChain.;Sounds like how Chainlink will bring Data into smart contacts.#This technology is contrary to what is used by many companies now, is not the transition to such a platform difficult for many?

ITCareerQuestions;9pbdmz;1539883760.0;/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9pbdmz/fastestbest_way_back_in_for_me/;Fastest/best way back in for me.;Hello. I've spent the last five years as a teacher in public schools. I'm burned out totally and education is a big mess in my area of the country right now. I want to go back into IT. I do have a bit of a background but much of it is in my past. It started in HS when I helped install the area's first Windows 3.1/Banyan Vines network at our school. After graduation I left for the Army where I was a medic but upon returning I got a job doing T1 HelpDesk at HostGator. I did that for about a year until I was included in a round of layoffs. I went and started my own reseller web hosting business that was ultimately unsuccessful. I would say the best skill I took away at the time was the ability to build a PC, install a Linux distro, make it a server, and get it on the internet. From there I worked as a QA engineer for MediaFire, testing their desktop and mobile apps for bugs and putting together and maintaining testing environments.  Unfortunately I was laid off again about 18 months into the gig with the rest of my team. I was frustrated and sought stability so I went into education. Five years later and my passion for computing has been rekindled and I'm looking at my best way back in. I don't hold any certifications and I have a non-IT bachelors degree. I am also in my 40s and believe with my knowledge, experience, and grit that I can attain a non-entry-level position in IT. I see myself as a network or big data guy, there is a Level 3 data center nearby that I'd love to work at one day. What is my best way back in? Thank you so much for your responses.;You must prove your worthiness in a trial by fire at the gates of Mount Maoola.#[deleted]#One non-conventional way back in without starting at entry level might be to look into company training positions, so that your teaching experience directly benefits you, then start getting into teaching more technical courses.  Really, though, I think the suggestions already made like getting your CCNA and then applying for junior networking positions are more likely to get you back into IT more quickly.#How rusty is your Linux experience?  Based on the way my phone rings, I would say if you can get a RHCSA and put together decent Dice and Linkedin profiles you would have a 6 month contract (that would pay more than some teachers make in a year) before Christmas.  Once you get an IT title, it's not hard to get another, just contract jump until you find somewhere to stay.  &#x200B   Before Reddit freaks out, to make more than the annual salary entry level teacher in Oklahoma in 6 months, you would not need to break $30/hour (if you were at least full time).#With no degree, you're going to be fighting an uphill battle as those mid-level positions usually get hundreds of applicants with a large majority having degrees and/or significant relevant experience.   While you probably are above an entry level position, it may be the best way to get your foot in the door. You may see if that L3 data center has any NOC positions, which can be seen as entry level, but you can usually work your way up as it's a larger organization with many arms.

CryptoMarkets;9ks31x;1538497415.0;/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/9ks31x/challenging_ethereum_dbx_public_chain_offers_a/;Challenging Ethereum — DBX Public Chain Offers a New Business Application Model;**DBXChain**As many of new public chains became available on mainnet this year and openly compete with blockchain product like Ethereum , 2018 has been known as ‘the first year of public chains’. Public chains have been drawing lots of attention in blockchain markets. DBXChain might be a main competitor to Ethereum in the near future.DBXChain, released by an internationally well-known public chain research team named DBX Foundation, is a value-based ecosystem of data based upon blockchain. This new value-based ecosystem is a decentralized data community that provides a platform for users to explore and exchange data. It provides a safe data exchange process and users are able to own their data rights. This new ownership with data is based upon blockchain technology.**Original DDPoS optimizes the consensus mechanism of blockchain**DDPoS is a new consensus mechanism that is created by DBXChain for the first time in the world. It helps resolve oligarchy and security issues from DPoS consensus mechanism by EOS. As everyone knows, DPoS consensus mechanism is similar to a shareholding system and its problems are quite obvious: first, it has a low voting rate.More than 90% shareholders never voted. It is because it takes time, energy and skills to vote, which are what most investors do not have. Additionally, there are many challenges dealing with bad nodes. If interfering nodes can’t be checked during a community election, it will put web security at risk.Then, how does DDPoS help resolve security and oligarchy issues while keeping its capacity at the same level? DDPoS makes the whole node selection system “fluid” so that block producer becomes a role, not a node, and this role can be transferred to other candidate producers at any time.With continuous data exchange at the bottom level of DBX public chain, the coupling level between a node and the whole ecosystem will be counted into an election system using weighted algorithm. During this process, users can vote at anytime, and DBXChain thus helps dodge potential bribery and security issues under DPoS system.**Enhance TPS and improves consensus efficiency**Blockchain is a distributed system, and a main factor that affects TPS is networks. Due to a large amount of nodes in a blockchain network are scattered around the world, the web state of each node is uncontrollable and it is hard to set a requirement to their bandwidth or to make sure everyone have access to stable network. This kind of situation is absolutely a disaster to TPS.Compared with underlying systems of “classic blockchain” such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, DBXChain is able to support more nodes– more than ten thousand nodes, and allows users to sign up and quit at anytime. The algorithm uses a voting system among potential block producers and cryptography techniques to improve algorithm’s efficiency. Similar to PBFT Prepare/ Commit, the use of aggregated signatures reduces the size of voting signature from nodes and therefore reduces the use of bandwidth. It also requires to exchange data twice for a block among all confirmed nodes. In additional to provide a good security, it efficiently improves consensus performance of BFT.**Building a win-win ecosystem base on big data**DBXChain has massive data, also many users and clients as resources for support, which make this program special. Many projects invested by Top Venture Capitals had ecological cooperation with DBX. Thus, DBX Chain is able to merge a large amount of support and resources from these projects, which is absolutely a good starting point.As it shows, the consensus mechanism by DDPoS has a promising future. These well-known resources in China chose DBXChain because they all needed internet that not only had high capacities, but was also highly secure and was able to prevent manipulations and bribery. All these requirements were met by DBXChain. In fact, DBXChain will support many developed businesses, which already has a large volume of data on classical internet. These data will test the capacity of DBXChain internet and its security. It is also why the new consensus mechanism of DDPoS and its public chain can outperform Ethereum and EOS in terms of democratization and security.**DataGame benefits its participants**DataGame is a DApp for crowd-sourcing data collection , where DBX demonstrates capacities and feasibility of its public chain. Every data collector can launch a data collecting game using a certain amount of DBX coins in areas such as AI, purchases and IOTs. Owners of data can get rewards by participating in games. They can also search data needed with high accuracy and pay for a specific amount based upon data size.DataGame has largely lowered prerequisites to participate for data owners, making more valuable and long-tail data available for sharing. Additionally, DataGame has also reduced costs to obtain data so that more users are able to achieve goals and get a brand new experience in data exchange in the blockchain world. As we can see, for DBX to build a new data infrastructure, the first step is to use DataGame.Obviously, the third generation of big data ecosystem will be more common, but this area will eventually become the most competitive among blockchain tycoons. In the face of big rival, we are looking forward to seeing if Ethereum will still be a leader in the public chain competition.;There is no doubt that it is a really good idea and this project will have a successful fund-raising campaign. Wish everything good to developers. P.S. The design of your web-site is nasty. I have spent more than an hour watching this animation #I think it should have been this way, because the project is implementing an unusual technology that its participants will use in the future.

I’ve read some stuff online, and almost each one of them say soemthing different. If I am entering Uni and majoring in Big Data, would that be similar to a Data Science major (I am specifically interested in AI and ML)(also, out of the 3 unis I am applying for, 2 of them have a Big Data major, and only one has a Data Science major). One concern is that I have read that there are a lot of statistics and commerce components involved in Big Data, which kinda makes me think that it might be more of a business related subject.;"Data Science has varying definitions, but generally it means statistics plus some programming.   Big Data refers to working with data that is ""too big"" for conventional databases. Think of Twitter data or all credit card transactions. I'm kind of surprised this is a whole major. I've only ever seen it as a course.#You should also look into what classes you’d be taking and the program in general. The data science degree at my school started last year and seems like pretty much a frankenstein major where they just pulled certain CS courses, statistics courses and a few others. At my school I’d say it would make more sense to go with one of three options: CS degree and aim to take all the data science related courses, CS degree with a math minor or math degree with CS minor.

Two months ago I started a new job where my life became a living hell. Some software engineer made the initial investigation for the project and it turns out that the plan he made was not very accurate. It is very tight and now we have to fulfill his plan. Not only that but also the projectr is a fixed time / fixed amount project so we dont have a lot of leeway in the amount of time we can use for our own learning. In my last job I was given a lot of freedom with the time in the first six months because I was new and they gave me time to learn the domain. But in this job they are already asking me when I go a day over my current tasks in the sprint. I am constantly late due to lack of my knowledge and my task estimates are always wrong because I dont really know the existing domain/software. **Thankless guy to ""help"" me**Recently they added a new guy to help me. The guy has 20 years of experience so I thought to myself ""Great, finally I will get some help and this will take some pressure off of me"". Well, this has been totally opposite. The guy literally does not know a lot about the programming language we are using and I have to tell him basic things like why there is an error with the ""precompiled headers"". Yesterday I told him how to add a new class to the project. He is taking a couple of hours away from my day every day. That is all ok but what pisses me off is that  he is thankless and says things in the meetings like ""it takes a couple of hours for me to explain things to him and do basic things like add a project"". This is because I have to do magic things with Jenkins, xml and other infrastructure things to get things ready for that ass. When I started two months ago then no one was there to help me. But I am there to help him with every question he has. They probably planned him as a replacement for me because I was going slow due to lack of domain knowledge and I am a temp employee.**Health**The last few weeks have been terrible for my health.

When my girlfriend comes to my house I am thinking about how I can speed up my task or how I will manage the delayed tasks in my meetings.**tl dr**I am tired of my current high pressure/tight deadline/no time to learn domain job and I want to change to an easier position where I can also enjoy my life.

There are terrible jobs out there too- you just stumbled upon one.  This is a temp job, you have free healthcare and stuff so just quit and start looking for new jobs at other companies.  #You could try working for a large corporation (outside of Big N), they are usually pretty chill and relaxed but the software is usually a little bit more outdated (stable).  It sounds like you might be working at a startup if you are dealing with tight budgets, fixed plans, and other stressful things like that. This is why I have recently avoided startups.#update your resume and apply for another job. do not say anything bad about your current employer during interviews.   i dont know what you are asking. this is a standard i dont like my job. look for a new job. #this is definitely more about personal issues between you and your coworkers  that being the case, just apply anywhere else. try and 'interview the company' and see if you like the people / team dynamic before joining your next one

After all, more than half of the world’s population is connected to the internet, and everything from social interactions to currencies are finding digital expressions that are as captivating as the real thing.According to a March study by the Pew Research Center, 25% of American adults report that they are online “almost constantly,” and nearly half acknowledge that they access the internet multiple times a day. They are not alone.Worldwide, more than 200 billion emails are sent, five billion Google searches are executed, six billion YouTube videos are viewed. Last Christmas, online shoppingsurpassed in-store purchases for the first time. In total, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created from the flurry of online activity that never ceases.Ultimately, the internet is driven by data. It’s both the outcome and the result of the digital age, and it’s incredibly valuable.In fact, its value is both the thing that makes it problematic and the reality that can make it fixable.At the same time that the internet is experiencing one of its most troubling times in recent memory, the blockchain has arrived as a differentiating technology that utilizes a distributed network and a decentralized ethos to redefine data management in a way that’s effective for our modern, digital ecosystem.https://bluzelle.com;

I think for most IT infrastructure type jobs there’s a lot of communication and service that companies would rather have someone locally for.   Also it would be really hard entering into IT and trying to work remotely as you don’t already have the built up skills of people that might be allowed to work remote #While they are out there, I think finding a remote job for one of your first IT jobs is not only extremely rare, but also not the best choice. Simply put you learn so much, and pick up so many things from simply talking to people around in an office setting. Beyond this you get your name and face out there for people to begin to know which can be really helpful for your future career.  I think it’s possible you could find a remote job, though very hard, and I wouldn’t recommend it. If you do look though, help desk, technical support and programming jobs all tend to be big winners in terms of finding one that lets you work remote most/all of the time.   Goodluck!

PAX received  regulatory approval from the New York State Department of Financial  Services early in September. Paxos claims that PAX has, “achieved the  fastest, wildest institutional adoption of any digital asset.” So far,  six of the ten largest cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and  OKEx, have listed PAX as a trading pair.  * DocuSign, a San Francisco-based company with over 400,000  customers, announced in a press release this weekend that it would begin  to integrate the Ethereum blockchain into its electronic signature and  transaction management service. DocuSign will offer customers an option  to have evidence of a DocuSign agreement listed on the Ethereum  blockchain. According to Ron Hirson, Chief Product Officer at DocuSign,  the record on the Ethereum blockchain will act as “tamper-proof evidence  for the transaction” that “enables any completed document to be  validated independently.”* Following an announcement yesterday by OKEx that the cryptocurrency  exchange would list 4 stablecoins, Huobi has announced that it would  soon begin listing four US Dollar-pegged stablecoins on its  cryptocurrency exchange. In its announcement, Huobi detailed that it  would list TrustToken’s TUSD, Circle’s USDC, Gemini’s GUSD, and Paxos’  PAX. Huobi Is currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange in  the world by daily trading volume.  * Kenya’s government is planning to leverage blockchain technology to  manage its government housing project responsible for 500,000 units,  according to a report by Kenyan news outlet, Star. The housing project  entails the construction of 500,000 housing units by 2022 and mortage  assistance for Kenyans making less than 100,000 Kenyan Shillings  (USD$992) who cannot afford mortgages. Blockchain technology will be  used in the project to evenly distibute the housing to deserving  participants.  * Notable investor and creator of Galaxy Investment Partners, Mike  Novogratz, has pulled back his forecast for Bitcoin, telling Bloomberg  on Monday that he does not believe Bitcoin will surpass USD$10,000 in  2018. In explaining his forecast, Novogratz said, “I think Q1 \[or\] Q2  \[2019\] if the institutions start coming in, we’ll put in new highs.”  Novogratz happened to be speaking while Fidelity Investments announced  the creation of a new venture, Fidelity Digital Asset Services. In  regards to Fidelity, Novogratz said, “They’ll probably be up and running  in January or Q1.” * Peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading volume levels in Argentina, Venezuela,  and Egypt have hit all-time high levels so far through October 2018. In  Argentina, citizens have flocked to use Bitcoin as a result of the  recent economic crisis in the country -- Argentinian regulators have  even relaxed regulations to allow for more Bitcoin ATMs in the country.  In Venezuela, citizens have been gearing up for the November 5th launch  of the state-backed Petro cryptocurrency, although reports indicate that  there is little pointing to the Petro’s existence in the country.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin transaction volumes in Croatia and Switzerland have  hit 2018 lows.  * Ping An Insurance, one of China’s largest insurers, is pursuing  innovation in blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and cloud  technology. At Ping An Insurance’s Investor Day last week, top Ping  executives delivered presentations and analyses of Ping’s business in  relation to the innovative technologies. Chief Finance Officer, Jason  Yao, said at the event, “We will further improve the strategy of Finance  and Technology and pursue Finance and Ecosystem. By leveraging five key  technologies, namely AI, blockchain, cloud, big data, and security, we  will keep improving efficiency, lowering costs, optimizing user  experience, and strengthening risk control, to enhance competitiveness.”   * While speaking at the Institutional Crypto: Laying the Foundation  conference in New York City hosted by Bloomberg, Gary Gensler, former  chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said that most  cryptocurrencies sold through initial coin offering (ICO) should be  classified as securities. Gensler went on to say, “I think  cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin need more protection, and probably more  protection than even the oil markets.” When asked about blockchain  technology, Gensler replied, “we should be technology-neutral.”**Sources:**r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/paxos-says-it-has-issued-50-mln-of-recently-launched-dollar-backed-stablecoin    r/https://www.coindesk.com/paxos-claims-50-million-in-price-stable-cryptocurrency-issued-in-first-weeks/    r/https://www.ccn.com/docusign-will-add-ethereum-blockchain-integration-to-verify-signatures/    r/https://www.docusign.com/blog/follow-docusign-fall-18-release/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=Blog_Fall18Release    r/https://bitcoinist.com/argentina-venezuela-and-egypt-post-record-p2p-bitcoin-trading-volumes/    r/https://www.coindesk.com/another-top-10-crypto-exchange-is-adding-4-stablecoins-this-week/    r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/kenyan-govt-to-use-blockchain-in-new-affordable-housing-project    r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/mike-novogratz-institutions-will-get-into-bitcoin-in-q1-q2-2019-bringing-new-highs    r/https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/10/16/novogratz-bitcoin-will-breakout-in-2019-but-institutions-still-want-crypto/    r/https://coinjournal.net/chinese-insurance-giant-ping-an-bets-on-blockchain-ai-cloud-in-fintech-push/    r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-cftc-chairman-gary-gensler-icos-should-be-considered-securities    r/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/most-tokens-from-icos-are-securities-former-cftc-head-says ;Great summary of news!#**Bitcoin (BTC) Basic Info:** [Website](https://bitcoin.org) - r/Bitcoin - [Abstract](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_short_description) - [History](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_history) - [Exchanges](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_exchanges) - [Wallets](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_wallets)   **Biases:** [Arguments For](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_pros) & [Arguments Against](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_cons) | **CryptoWikis:** [Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/policy#wiki_cryptowikis_program_-_.28work_in_progress.29) - [Contribute Content](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/contributing)  ---   *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This evolution has come in the years where crypto has existed... however has failed dominate.The boom in cashless mobile payments has come from commercial apps such as Wechat and Alipay.From 2013-2016 mobile payment transactions increased from 3 billion to 97 billion a year. The startling thing is how little your end chinese consumer actually cares about transaction fees or data harvesting. The charge is on the merchant side so the consumer doesn't care and fees are cheap enough so the merchants don't really care. One way these apps can make money is through harvesting ""big data"". They record and keep records of every transaction. Information that can be passed on to and state controlled.Facebook's is reportedly struggling to monetize Whatsapp, they have already trialling mobile payments in India. Whatsapp has 1.5bn monthly users.. if it does roll out a payment network it will be the Wechat and Alipay of the West.When spreading the word of crypto I always try ensure that **decentralisation** is the biggest takeaway message.That's one quality that many companies and goverments are always going to struggle to fully achieve  :)";"""Decentralisation""  You mean Monero?

YouTube Music is literally the best music streaming app or service I have ever used.;"The service is kind of pricey if you're only interested in the music streaming, but I think the addition of YT Red really pays for itself if you are a frequent YouTube user, which I am.But for me, personally... honestly, the music suggestions are literally the best of any service I have ever used. It uses the YouTube suggestion engine, and in my opinion the ""Your mixtape"" and ""offline mixtape"" features are literally worth the premium by themselves.Your Mixtape is a personalized infinite playlist for online streaming, and it is wonderful. I suspect there is some deep AI involvement in the superb suggestions list. I receive some of the best songs of all time for me flowing one after the other, which is all I really *want*. The other generated playlists are also superb by the way.But in my opinion, the REAL moneymaker here is the Offline Mixtape feature. This feature periodically auto-updates and downloads a ""mixtape"" for you to listen to next time you lose access to the internet. You can set it to download up to 100 songs automatically. I would generally recommend setting it to WiFi-only downloads to save data.That said, I just got off a frustrating day of air travel and at each layover, the app generated and downloaded a new mixtape, which I exhausted on the next leg of the journey. Short version: it is a killer feature and sells the subscription by itself. I literally found the feature by accident this morning and I'm already in love.This is the finest display of Google's big data strategy I have seen so far. Nobody has time to sit down and make playlists unless it's for a special occasion. This is exactly the problem that AI is perfect for solving.";"No thanks. They have a better service in GPM that they did absolutely nothing with and will eventually shut down.   #Nice try, Google marketing employee.#Nice ad#Tried Deezer, Spotify, Tidal, and GPM in the past year. Spotify wins imo#This definitely doesn't read like an ad... #I tried it for a bit. While it was good it still wasn't great. I still think they need to tweak the UI and add some animations in certain places. Also fustrating that while in the app you actually have to press next or back buttons for the next song, I'd much rather swipe because it seems more intuitive. Still don't have my Google Play Music Playlists and all the songs I had purchased the GPM. Suggestions are good but can be better. I'd like the ability to disable YouTube likes from my Playlists because sometimes I'll like a YouTube video that isn't even really a song and it will mess with what I actually like and show up in reccomended or randomly show up in my playlist which o constantly have to skip over. Their are more things but I just can't remember off the top of my head since I ready want back to Spotify.  #Until it's integrated with Play Music it's a hard pass.#Soundtrack for your life, brought to you by Google.

benshapiro;9o88e4;1539566161.0;/r/benshapiro/comments/9o88e4/im_100_certain_i_could_beat_ben_shaprio_in_a/;I'm 100% certain I could beat Ben Shaprio in a debate about our Criminal Justice system;"After listening to some videos of Ben Shapiro talking about the United States Criminal Justice system, I am honestly surprised how vapid his arguments really are when anyone with beyond a college degree thinks about it. To premise my counter-argument, I am referring to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkQUej3v3Qs) video when Ben was speaking at Northwestern University and was asked a question regarding the war on drugs/incarceration, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETcGHOeXgJU) video where Ben discusses some criminal justice/criminology related topics and related crime statistics. Below are my key conclusions.##**Ben's main argument is a culture-of-violence argument.** Ben is regurgitating the Oscar Lewis [*culture of poverty*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Lewis) argument. This argument states that there is a subculture in the population, typically poor minority communities, that internalizes bad moral values and teaches its members to subsist on handouts from the government, promotes laziness, instigate violence or crime, resulting in disorganization and overall malicious behavior from individuals in this group. Hence, these are ""thugs"" and if they simply stopped committing crime all of their problems would go away.However, Ben *ignores* the vast scholarly evidence of sociology, particularly Emile Durkheim and later the tradition of ""Chicago School of Sociology"". [Emile Durkheim](http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/dl.html) gave us the idea of mechanical vs organic society, which is a natural transition that all groups and societies experience when all groups of people integrate and the collective conscience governing morality is re-established. This broad idea ties into another book called [*Black Metropolis.*](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Metropolis-Study-Negro-Northern/dp/0226162346) Due to the very palpable and enduring realities of slavery and the Jim Crow era that followed the civil war, this mechanical/organic transition was stifled for African Americans unlike that of earlier Catholic immigrants such as the Irish or Polish. Unlike these white immigrants, African Americans experienced long-lasting discrimination and forced concentration into specific neighborhoods, which seriously deprived their economic employment opportunities in the division of labor because of things like the lack of limited wealth or skill accrual and structural racism which prevented blacks from transitioning into organic society via employment or housing opportunities.The Chicago school describes the unique historical process & ecological growth of cities and communities. How is the unique growth of cities impacted by the story & successions of African Americans? It ties directly into critiquing sub-culture theory & social disorganization theory. When Ben says races (particularly blacks) develop their own subculture of values, morals, and behaviors, he is ignoring all of the academic evidence on social disorganization theory & misrepresenting the statistics we use to measure crime. Ben ignores all of this in favor of simplistic arguments regarding statistics and big data. [Andrew Abbott](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580667) mentions the danger of simply using “big data statistics” to understand the complexity of our history as a country. Kalil Gibran Muhammad has another excellent [book](https://www.amazon.com/Condemnation-Blackness-Making-Modern-America/dp/0674062116) explaining of how we interpret crime statistics matters. This was echoed in [*The Philadelphia Negro*](https://www.amazon.com/Philadelphia-Negro-Social-Study/dp/0812215737) by W.E.B. Dubois and his documentation of early historical accounts where social scientists tried to justify black criminality or inferiority with statistics. This was done to justify racial inequality in areas of crime rates, literacy, and poverty. Finally, Harvard sociologists Robert Sampson and William Julius Wilson just came out with the [reassessment](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/reassessing-toward-a-theory-of-race-crime-and-urban-inequality/68C99328C0574E23D1CBC6FDFD60BED9) to their famous 1995 article *Toward a theory of race, crime, and urban inequality""*, which I think does the best job of dismantling Ben Shapiro's entire argument. If he would debate me on just that article alone I think I would win. There is no way that Ben would bother reading that article anyway because his overall sub-culture argument would instantly fall apart. Other small corrections I would make against Ben is his plea bargains quote, which Ben does bring up but does not elaborate on by saying that many of these individuals are actually innocent due to our out of control criminal justice system and lack of indigent public counsel. Another issue I had is the false-equivalence Ben uses between crack and crystal meth to make a false-argument regarding discrimination in drug sentencing. Crystal Meth and Crack are two entirely different drugs, Ben should have compared crack to cocaine and the characteristics of those individuals arrested for possession. This is because cocaine is seen as a wealthy white drug versus crack being seen as a poor minority drug. This is key when understanding disparities in drug sentencing between blacks and whites and their representation in the criminal justice system.In sum, I just hate how Ben Shapiro will only debate college students who know nothing about a topic and who are by definition (you go to university to learn) ill-equipped to tackle Ben's fallacious points. Debate one of the living professors that I mentioned and let's see how fast facts care about Ben's feelings.   ";Tweet at him. Pretty sure he has yet to turn down a debate#I wish to point out that he actually had his mind changed regarding weed as he recently mentioned at one of his university talks  Thus I would not be surprised if you could change his mind on this topic  My suggestion to you is that you research “Restorative Justice” it is possibly the best solution to the massive criminal justice problem in America   http://restorativejustice.org/restorative-justice/about-restorative-justice/tutorial-intro-to-restorative-justice/  TL DR Restorative justice is a theory of justice that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminal behaviour. It is best accomplished through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders. This can lead to transformation of people, relationships and communities.#I appreciate how well-thought this post is. Make a serious effort to contact him, and let us know what he says. His email is: bshapiro@dailywire.com#I’m pretty sure he’s willing to debate professors but none are willing. He’s been questioned by a few at his speeches and fares pretty well considering the professors came prepared knowing the question ahead of time while Ben did not. #This sounds like a very interesting debate and I hope you contact Ben to make this real#You really should try to get in touch with him. Would be interesting to see/listen to a debate like this.

longevity;9mv6d1;1539135329.0;/r/longevity/comments/9mv6d1/broad_institute_talk_and_trying_to_persuade/;Broad Institute Talk and Trying to Persuade Accomplished People;"I just went to a talk at the Broad Institute on cloud computing, machine learning, and the future of medicine. The speaker is working on a big data project regarding cardiovascular disease. We talked to the speaker afterward about how even if you got rid of cancer or heart disease that the overall human lifespan would only increase very modestly. I asked if he had thought about working on something more upstream like aging and life extension, as in the work of Aubrey or George Church. He said there seem to be a lot of promising things but that it wasn't his area of expertise. Sometimes answers like this can be depressing because it feels like a disconnect between beliefs and action. After posing the following: ""What you're doing isn't that impactful. Wouldn't it be good to consider working on something more impactful?"", it can be disheartening to get lackluster and uncurious responses. This is one reason I respect the philosophy of effective altruism, which makes this question one of the main drivers of the actions it takes. His talk was really fascinating, and it's wonderful that he and his team are doing such imaginative work, but I just hoped for a more engaged response. I'm motivated by the small chance of getting people to do more impactful work in the same way 80,000 Hours is trying to get people to consider or reconsider careers. Influencing others' perspectives when it comes to thinking about the world or solving problems, even in casual conversation with educated and accomplished folks, can sometimes be successful, and the possibility of it keeps me going. What have your experiences been in similar circumstances?";"Pivoting in science seems hard. I'm starting to look at postdoc and industry positions. Many of them want me to have done my doctoral work on the same thing they work on. And if you're a principal investigator in academia, most of the work you do ends up being what you can get a grant for.#You have to have one intellectual accomplishment up your sleeve that intimidates people because now they have to seriously consider the possibility that what you are saying might have some hidden genius behind it they can't immediately see.#IMO, the current research attitude is very heavily influenced by institutional pressures: There's billions of dollars allocated for research on individual diseases, cancer, heart disease, because people know that one of their loved ones died from those causes and thus create advocacy around this. Longevity is vague, aging has not taken the cultural umbrella yet. The FDA does not consider aging a disease, e.g. for metformin and fisetin the aging-related clinical trials all happen in contorted forms after targeted-disease approval or for already-safe compounds. If there is one single politically powerful advocate for this idea in government, even redirecting 1% of federal funds in this direction would be a huge boon.  I mostly agree with the ""more impactful"" designation as well. However, in a rationalist mindset you do have to be cautious in being overconfident that your idea or measurement of impact is the right one: And even if it is, you need to find effective, persuasive ways to communicate it as such. The top minds in the overall ""umbrella"" of aging don't all agree on what the best approach is.  Some people are skeptical that there are longevity dividends to be reaped, and many are skeptical that the SENS approach is the correct one. Others think that tackling cardiovascular diseases directly will yield a concrete, pure payoff, while aging is vague and unknown still. In all the health-related fields, what is indeed the most impactful? I don't think the best of us have a consensus yet. However, I do think \*way more\* people and money should be betting on the longevity payoff, because there is enough confidence that it's right and payoff if real.   I don't think we should expect government to be run on a purely utilitarian, altruistic model either since that's not how people tend to shake out. The Emperor of All Maladies is an amazing book that covers cancer from the very beginning to fights and lobbying of powerful Senators in the mid-century to secure funding to create a War on Cancer.  The downstream vs. upstream argument is very interesting. You'd want to calculate the chance that you are ""right"", and then based on that confidence do a particular allocation. Maybe a Kelly Criterion-style bet. Clearly 0% aging research is probably wrong, but so is 90%."

To point a. - Buses run a range of different routes. They can become late at any point in the route. For example, on Saturday, I was with a friend of mine who was on a 525 in Olympic Park. Dawn Fraser Ave was closed next to ANZ. State Transit were not told. There was a bit of an issue as he found out how to divert. He left Olympic Park Station on time, arrived at Parramatta 12 mins late. It's the small things, you can't always predict them.  To point b. - Buses show as 'no real time available' if they either don't exist, or the Opal Readers aren't working. If the latter, the driver has not been able to sign into that running of the route, and therefore it does not exist in the system.   To point c. - Buses may show as 'last known location' - this is an implementation within the third-party apps and not something that GTFS-R is able to accurately predict.   #Generally, most of the time, the real time data on the Sydney transport network is one of the best. If you go to Melbourne for example, it's really bad and sometimes non-existent. #Honestly? http://imgur.com/gallery/0NQvvjj  The service interruption note mentions ""up to 25 minutes"".

It is a blockchain platform that was created to support p2p as well as business and clients applications. It was built mainly for consumer applications to be used by experts that are well knowledgeable with the needs of consumer needs making use of state of the art artificial intelligence and big data implementation.The enormous favorable position of AI Zeus Blockchain is that this arrangement will have the capacity to average up to two hundred thousand transactions for every second. Its speed is relied upon to average around 0.05 seconds. Later on with long haul, the group expects that all the transaction will just cost the client portions of a solitary penny. With expanding square sizes, it means will likewise abandon an ample space that can be utilized to present extra transactions in each square. So the transactional fee will be lessened to around 0.001$. The platform completely makes the minimal effort for this.By expanding the system’ scalability, the expanded square size is required to go far. This will help increment its throughput and proficiency considering the aggregate number of transactions that are to be performed every second.To get to the information and also settle on critical choices by having the capacity to comprehend the idea of the considerable number of data designs in order to encourage self-governing connections between the applications by utilizing the artificial intelligence. The independent idea of the platform implies that clients can hope to be given top notch security that is intended to keep the event of deadly mistakes.Website: https://aizeus.net/Bounty0x username: ibrash600;

I have a lot of practical experience with both AWS and Big Data technologies and want to supplement my education (my BS is not in CS). I don't really have any desire to be a solutions architect, so I was wondering if it mattered at all which entry level cert I got if I'm just using it as a stepping stone to the Big Data Specialty.;"although it may cost more, do it for peace of mind and confidence building. although i didn't have much experience with aws, i did the aws cloud practioner to get confidence in ""how not to overspend on AWS."" the solution architect route should than teach me to ""how do i put together generic solutions."" got the cloud practitioner within 2 weeks, will go for associate after 6 weeks of long study#Solutions Architect will be better for you since you're already familiar with AWS. Cloud Practioner is more basic and introductory. You don't necessarily need to want to be a solutions architect to take the certification.#I didn’t realize that Cloud Practitioner allowed you to take the Big Data exam. Just go that route. Maybe go back for SA or SysOps later. But CP is a much easier exam. #I'm in the same boat as you and just passed the Cloud Practitioner.  The exam is a joke. I have no idea why it exists, except to bleed money out of people in exactly your situation.   The exam should be retired and they should remove the prerequisite for the specialty exams."

The smooth install of Docker containers allows for fast, effortless, efficient installation of applications. When I have a need for an application I click install, 99% of the time they install in less than 30 seconds. Once I'm done, they have served their purpose I remove them. While this may not be everyone's flavour, for me, As someone who works with computers all day every day it's nice to have a simple option. If I need anything else I use an Ubuntu Image.   The issues with the deletion of files is a well-publicised issue with the torrent client itself. And something that is easily found with a Google search or looking at the knowledgebase articles. Simple, use FTP or use a remote client and there are no issues. Personally, I have faced no major issues, and Continue to be very satisfied with the product I purchased.   I reach the speeds you are referring to in rutorrent with no issues. You may need to refad up on seeding and leaching dynamics within the torrent protocol to understand better before you say speeds are rubbish. While the version of deluge that has been adapted for AppBoxCo has been modified for more streamlined performance and better functionality it also has its flaws, native flaws. Each user has their own preferences, and I still prefer ruTorrent.  With a shared disk dynamic, as stated in comments. Thing like checking torrents can take a while. Using common sense, however, to reduce write speeds to allow for faster read speeds would improve your performance. With 400plus torrents downloading I would expect trying to check one is going to face issues. Even on a local machine, my home machine is not a budget build and I still get reduced speeds checking torrents with large numbers of downloading torrents active or seeding.   All of the disks are brand new. With the old disks being destroyed with the migration. They are definitely not old or crappy. This has never been hidden information, if I could afford the disks they have I would be over the frickin moon.   I don't even want to ask why you need to keep restarting your client. I have needed to restart it once in the last 3 months (other than when an update is performed)  As someone who is still very active In I chat I can say that the statement about refusing to acknowledge I/O speed issue is not true. Multiple and still ongoing improvements have been made off of the back of users feedback.   There are big things happening. Not every improvement has a face value, not every improvement effects every user, every user has a different experience and need-sets and that's the beauty of the platform. If you need a more heavy duty platform for rapid downloading, rebuilding and upload of torrents, then anyone who knows their stuff will tell you a shared disk is not designed for you.   You didn't HAVE TO write this to save the next guy from having a headache. As I would assume the next guy would have purchased the product that suited their needs.  I, to this day, am very happy with the service I get, and the admins do an amazing job. Your opinions are your own, and I am not being disrespectful or saying they are wrong, I hope this serves as an alternative and opposite perspective of the services offered by AppBoxCo. #>Great idea how you can install apps like ubuntu with root  I'm not sure you understand what you're talking about.  Also, what box did you have?  That would shed a little light on performance issues.  If you had the cheapest offering they have on tap, well fuck yeah you're gonna have a hard way to go about doing pretty much anything.  The same holds true for any vendor of this model.#I tried them for a month as well and their service just shits the bed too much. I get torrents stuck at 99.99% and forced to recheck. Stalled torrents that just stop when there are plenty of peers.  Poor download speeds to US on a 1GB connection. I get 150Mbps on average. I have another seedbox with UltraSeedbox and see 600Mbps+.

The other thing I would do is try to maximize your money to it's fullest potential at your age.  You should try to save something even if its only $100 a check.  What you can do to help start grow your money is get a credit card that has good cash back.  Use that credit card for everything you purchase, and stop using cash.  This way you are maximizing your free cash back.  Open up a savings account with a bank that offers a high rate, like Ally for example has 1.85%.  Dump your cash back and any money you save from your pay into that account and start making some interest on it.  Try to do your best to maximize your money even if it is only a small amount.

I'm going to upgrade the stock radio in my wife's Chevy Traverse so I'm pretty set on another Pioneer.She's an iPhone user so I'm looking at CarPlay models. She also uses Waze and it looks like she can use Waze via CarPlay.We're both SiriusXM listeners but we live in a rural area where cell service is spotty. I'll be installing the SiriusXM tuner as well.With my AVH-X5700BHS I can't use App mode (I use Android) and play SiriusXM at the same time since they're on different inputs.Does the AVH-2440NEX still have the same limitation?Before anyone says it - I don't want to use the SiriusXM phone app - again, cell service is spotty and I don't have a big data plan since I need the tethering option occasionally.;Yes you can still listen to XM, AM/FM, CD, ect while in CarPlay mode. You just don’t have control of it while in that mode short of steering wheel controls. So you’d need to exit CarPlay to navigate the XM menu if you want to do anything in depth and then navigate back into CarPlay once you’re done.

But everyone keeps talking about big data, iiot, iot, analytics and blockchain..I dont find any of that topics interesting besides artificial inteligence.Should i focus only on what do i have interest in? Or should i study the new coming techonlogies like it or not? I have some basic knowledge on everything;Big data, IoT, blockchain, AI, etc. have become buzzwords. Of course the amount of data stored in databases is growing everyday, more and more devices are being connected to the internet, and the research on AI, especially in the context of neural networks will probably go on for quite some time.   However you shouldn't decide on what to do in your life depending on what is 'hot' right now. In my opinion you should always try to do what you enjoy doing and what you are interested in.  May I know which topics you find particularly interesting? :)#It's easier for us to learn the things we like. And the good news for you that the 3 things that will be highly developed in the future are 1) Big Data Analytics, 2) AI and others I forget.  &#x200B   You have to keep learning about AI, this is a very good thing and even better because you like it.#I'm not really into those topics either so I feel in the same boat sometimes.  They seem too business-y for me.  Keep in mind some people are more interested in the financial aspect of CS in college or think focusing on current buzzwords looks better for them.   Keep learning about the topics you like because AI and low level programming and such are always gonna be valuable moving forward.

How do you go from never programmed anything -> getting asked to code full time in scala? Would your job be a full time programmer, or would you manage a spark project? I can imagine that to manage a big data project properly you might want to learn something about the technologies used, but I doubt you would have to actually learn programming.   If your job is actually to program full time id say, considering no programming experience, a year or two to be a proficient programmer (in any language you pick). Learning the language is not the hard part, a programmer can learn a new language in a few weeks or months. What will be the major roadblock for you is all the general programming skills and just applying programming in general to solve problems, and thats whats important. #I've seen people do 4-year CS degrees and fail to learn how to program  I've seen people pick up enough to work with and the habit of learning more in a couple of weeks (not to say that you'd memorize the whole language/framework/... in that time, but you'd be able to write programs that worked and look up new things as you needed them). I've seen a study that gave people a simple programming test at the start and end of a programming course and got the same results each time, and argued that students either understood the concepts immediately or not at all. I appreciate that this isn't a terribly useful answer for basing a decision on, but I fear it may be the reality.#[deleted]#Would you be learning full time? It's hard to ballpark if we don't know how much time you're spending learning.

Two months ago I started a new job where my life became a living hell. Some software engineer made the initial investigation for the project and it turns out that the plan he made was not very accurate. It is very tight and now we have to fulfill his plan. Not only that but also the projectr is a fixed time / fixed amount project so we dont have a lot of leeway in the amount of time we can use for our own learning. In my last job I was given a lot of freedom with the time in the first six months because I was new and they gave me time to learn the domain. But in this job they are already asking me when I go a day over my current tasks in the sprint. I am constantly late due to lack of my knowledge and my task estimates are always wrong because I dont really know the existing domain/software. **Thankless guy to ""help"" me**Recently they added a new guy to help me. The guy has 20 years of experience so I thought to myself ""Great, finally I will get some help and this will take some pressure off of me"". Well, this has been totally opposite. The guy literally does not know a lot about the programming language we are using and I have to tell him basic things like why there is an error with the ""precompiled headers"". Yesterday I told him how to add a new class to the project. He is taking a couple of hours away from my day every day. That is all ok but what pisses me off is that  he is thankless and says things in the meetings like ""it takes a couple of hours for me to explain things to him and do basic things like add a project"". This is because I have to do magic things with Jenkins, xml and other infrastructure things to get things ready for that ass. When I started two months ago then no one was there to help me. But I am there to help him with every question he has. They probably planned him as a replacement for me because I was going slow due to lack of domain knowledge and I am a temp employee.**Health**The last few weeks have been terrible for my health. I have high blood pressure for the last three days and I wake up stressed with my remaining tasks. When my girlfriend comes to my house I am thinking about how I can speed up my task or how I will manage the delayed tasks in my meetings.**tl dr**I am tired of my current high pressure/tight deadline/no time to learn domain job and I want to change to an easier position where I can also enjoy my life. I am not looking for a testing job and I am ok with software engineering, management, big data or any other cs career position.  **I dont mind the ""CRUD"" jobs or easy jobs if the pay is good.

The 2080ti would give you the FPS back that you lose by going Ryzen over Intel.#Don't go with an AIO that isn't specifically designed to cover 100% of the IHS - many reviews online have shown that tower-style air coolers like the Noctua NH-U14s, Cooler Master Wraith Ripper, and DeepCool's Fryzen cool better than most AIOs without the Threadripper's rectangular coldplate design.  You don't have many good options for AIO with TR, to be fair, but your current choice isn't going to be anywhere near the best for what you're going to pay for it, and push/pull on a rad so thin probably isn't worth it either and will have, at best, negligibly-better performance on cooling the CPU (although it might provide better airflow inside the case if you mount the RAD in front as intake).  Since you're looking at a large ATX case, you will probably be better served with a TR4-specific AIO if you truly do want to go that route, but you can probably save $ and go with a (good) tower air cooler and do just as well.

Most of the time I didn't have to consider Big Data. Example problems I would solve are things like detecting topics in a corpus of text or determining sentiment and things like that. I worked with Python and would use the library Spacy a lot rather than NLTK, this does a lot of the tokenization and stemming work for you, you can detect sentence structures with POS tags and entity detection. Learn Spacy and also look at word2vec with the gensim library. That should be a good starting point that will be relevant to most jobs in text analysis. Try simple tasks like topic extraction, also be aware of differences in language and how to make analysis language agnostic.  There are loads of jobs in NLP, it's so useful in so many areas. You should be able to find plenty of work if you can demonstrate knowledge with a few examples on github or a blog or something

A few hours later, I see an ad for the same brand’s conditioner on my instagram app. It’s spooked me out a little! Is this is coincidence or is it big data at play?

It's so fucking invasive.#Have you bought this kind of shampoo before? Do you allow Instagram to have access to your location? Did you buy anything else?  My first bet is that they used instagram's analytics to profile you. Read this article about target:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#66ad1ae66668  In it, it describes how target's analytics are so good that they could determine that a girl was pregnant and knew which items she would statistically like to buy based on data they had on her despite not telling anyone of her pregnancy. Most people aren't unique and you might fit into a category of specific people who actively use that product.    If you are taking pictures of yourself, and chatting with friends, and using an email account across multiple social media sites, it wouldn't be hard to build a consumer profile. If your friends buy a product, they might try to push ads to you for the peer pressure effect.

We have had enough problems with our firewalls even without a huge proxy farm running on it as well.What are your opinions?1 - One big firewall which handles everything (Firewalling, Proxy, IPs, Application Control, VPN, ...)or2 - a slightly smaller box and dedicated services (the classical approach).or3 - Or maybe something between, e.g. IPS as blade, but dedicated proxy farm.​thanks,max;Firewall which only performs basic firewalling functions + Zscaler / Cloud Security. This also eliminates the need of back hauling and you can use something inexpensive like SRX300 if you’ve got a lot of branches as a router which connects to your central security platform. You can also directly let end users connect to it who are outside your network, so we found this more flexible and scalable than a huge central security stack.#pfSense, but would run multiple installs to break up the rules as needed.#I would go 2 or 3.  Or 4 : firewall on prem + proxy SaaS#Help me understand your proxy farm.. are these subscribers that get their own environment and you need to segment?

After over 3 years of R&D, we're taking a different sensor-based and big data approach to solve the problem of unbalanced heating and cooling in the home with dynamic air distribution.Alea Air transforms basic HVAC systems by replacing standard registers with smart vents that, based on room-by-room preferences, track and adjust temperature, monitor air quality, and sense other environmental variables.To address the common problem of rooms that are too hot or too cold, Alea’s vents use the vast array of sensors they contain to collect key data that’s streamed wirelessly to Alea’s cloud. There this and other data (eg. users preferences, weather and pollution forecasts) are carefully analyzed using machine learning and data analytics techniques to enable Alea’s proprietary algorithms to determine each individual vent’s operating instructions. These instructions are then transmitted back to each vent to meet the homeowners’ preferences.  Alea Air is the only integrated solution that can generate a thermal profile of the entire home, assess the HVAC performance, and provide, room by room, unsurpassed comfort while working with the home’s smart thermostat to run the central heating and cooling systems at far higher efficiency.**Alea Air sensors include:*** Two thermometer and one infrared sensors for accurate tracking of room, duct air and vent surface temperature in each room* Air quality sensors to measure volatile organic compounds* UV and ambient light sensors for room environment monitoring* Pressure sensors to monitor static pressure in the ductwork and protect HVAC systems from air pressure damage* Humidity sensors to accurately measure moisture and ‘feels like’ air temperature* Audio sensors to monitor and eliminate annoying “whistling” sounds* Bluetooth and long-range wireless for easy setup and reliable long-range connectivity to a central Airhub.[Alea Air Product Video](https://reddit.com/link/9lfflr/video/rrjtilfz68q11/player)Alea is now available for Pre-order and the first batch of vents are scheduled to ship in January 2019. More details can be found at[ https://www.alealabs.com](https://www.alealabs.com/). We look forward to sharing more with you and answering any questions you may have about our solution. Thank you,The Alea team;How does it address the issue that other  smart vents have of causing extra stress on the blower fan/other components and potentially causing problems down the road? #Hey, I k ow I’m late to the party but I’ve been researching smart vents and you guys look interesting.  How long have you been developing this product?  Have you done internal testing concerning effectiveness, efficiency, and safety for HVAC systems that you could present here?  You seem to be saying all the right things, so the one lingering question is: does it actually work?  Thanks#These guys seem like a scam. I would avoid purchasing from them. They look like they stole the Keen Smart Vent IP and made a knockoff smart vent. How can we just filter this subreddit to avoid crap scams like this?

It's pretty simple at the end of the day.  Don't worry too much about Hadoop. Take 1 hour out of your day to understand why you might want to do distributed computing with a reducer. Hadoop is _much_ more than that, but unless you want to be a big data infrastructure engineer, just understanding the _ideas_ are what's important. #No.  It is essential to survive in a role that requires kafka/hadoop/hive though.  If you don't want to learn it, don't apply to those roles. Plenty exist.#Depends on the product and the level of experience they are expecting#If a start-up is asking for a 'full stack' engineer responsible for the front-end that also knows enough about Kafka, that by itself is a huge red flag. They don't want to pay for specialists.  So no  if your focus is front-end development you can stay away from these few *very* specific tools. The vast majority of projects won't use them.#Hadoop is so broad, it should be a separate field entirely in big data. Hive is nothing more than one of many mpp’s that builds on top of Hadoop. This is more dependent on the companies you work for, imo. I’m not a full stack dev but this seems entirely different from typical full stack tech. We hire consultants just to work with hive in my company for example.

Why? It leaves the most doors open. Any PhD in ML is competitive as hell because every undergrad and grad school hopeful wants that. It's good to get started early in case you ever do want to apply for it. Plus it's actual research experience so you can see first hand whether you would like to eventually get a PhD or not. My general advice is explore as much as possible while still early. This is the best way to find out your goals, interests, your ""specialization"", etc. The only way to find out whether you will like something is to try it.  Oh you didn't like research? Fair enough. Just apply for a data internship next year. No doors closed and now you know what you like or don't like. Plus you just upgraded your network in ML and data science by working in a well-connected lab. As opposed to an internship, you get no connections with data scientists."

That means a future where my children can also live in a healthy and peaceful world. Luckily I had the chance of working for private and public organizations. Also I have experience working in the construction of fiber optics networks in cities.Within Parksen I bring the knowledge and the experience in creating smart and sustainable cities.**Does it seem like a logical background to what you do now?**Yes! As a professional I see possibilities in creating smart and integrated sustainable cities. A platform like Parksen and ParQ really helps.**Give us a one-minute pitch for what you are doing now.**We are developing a green, smart and connected parking platform with smart IoT devices, AI and blockchain technology,  and a parking app for vehicle owners and cities all across the globe. We also collect big data with which municipalities and commercial parties can create policies or more.The platform will make money based on a kickback fee every time a parking session is started from our platform, but will be free-to-use for cities and commercial parking providers.Making the platform free-to-use for cities and commercial parking providers will help them save a lot on costs for development, hardware and maintenance costs, and gives us an edge while implementing the platform to cities and providers all across the globe.As we already work with 113 municipalities here in The Netherlands, we are looking to finalize our expansion to 14 EU member states, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.Moreover, after our business trip to China, we are happy to see our negotiations to enter 60 Chinese cities moving forward towards their final conclusion, allowing us to start a pilot in Xiamen during the beginning of 2019.As we grow both here in the EU and outside the continent, we aim to bring a global parking solution into fruition.**Why did you get involved with this Parksen and ParQ?**The ParkQ mission, a Green, Smart and Connected City Platform is the next thing for me. Working from a city development perspective in realizing the mission statement is great fun and rewarding. It also helps that we have a fantastic team.**Why do you think it is such a powerful idea?**Saving time, money and preventing someone getting unhappy of not getting a parking spot in combination with really helping the environment. With IoT gathering big data that will serve as a reliable source for creating policies or more.  What is not to like about this idea.**How can people find out more about 1. The Parksen and ParQ 2. you & your work?**You can always check us on our site: [www.parqtoken.com](http://www.parqtoken.com/)Moreover I would suggest going to the “All you need to know about PARQ” as well as Parksen:[https://www.parqtoken.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-parq/](https://www.parqtoken.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-parq/)There you can find our executive summary, token economics, whitepaper and all related docs are available for you to read and of course join us by buying our PARQ tokens with 30% discount.**Anything else you’d like to add / we should have asked?**The Green, Smart and Connected City Platform utilizes the IOTA and Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts, IoT devices, artificial intelligence and a real-time parking app.The Parksen parking app, running in over 113 Dutch cities, allows drivers to find and pay for their parking spaces, showing them the closest one to their destination, saving them money, time and frustration, as well as helping to reduce CO2 emissions.For those investors who ask, correctly, “how do we make money?” Well, we receive a 5% kickback fee on all parking transactions that were activated by our cloud-based (SAAS) solution, and by distributing smart, low priced IoT devices and a free-to-use platform to commercial parking providers and local, regional and national governments, you can imagine how much we can generate when we disrupt a 100 billion dollar industry.I’m confident that with our team, a mixture of seasoned professionals and young upcoming people, we can make a difference in realizing a green, smart and connected city.**How can people contact you & learn more about you?**You can get in touch directly on social media and of course on Telegram.As well as via mail : [support@parqtoken.com](mailto:support@parqtoken.com)Don’t hesitate to ask anything and even better invest![https://www.parqtoken.com/](https://www.parqtoken.com/);

I feel my current job has helped develop a baseline of client serving and analytical skills, however, I want to transition into a consulting and advising role rather than being just the auditor. Ultimately, I want the MBA to help me further develop my network and analytical skills (programs with an emphasis on big data and consulting would be particularly appealing). Long term, I have always had an interest in real estate and infrastructure and moving into a position in those industries would be ideal.* Target schools: Kellogg (realize M7 is a bit of a stretch), Booth, Darden, Ross, Fuqua, Haas (would prefer to stay in eastern US if possible). Am open to other suggestions. Would ideally want to do FT as my firm rarely pays for MBAs anyway from what I hear.Spare Thoughts - should I1. Retake the GMAT2. Beef up ECs3. Transfer out of audit4. All of the above?ThanksEdit: Corrected my score breakdown;Beef up EC, but your stats are fine. If you want to retake the GMAT, go for it. Getting higher then a 730 is incredible. You should definitely add some M7s to your list.#Since you have time on your side and you are considering M7 schools, it may not be a bad idea to try to keep improving your GMAT score.

I really wanna be a great developer working with big data etc etc in the future, but if i cant make a app without large bugs and without a good stability, this dream is almost impossible :( . I dont wanna transform in a perfect developer in some days, thats why i am asking what is the best pratices to be better :)&#x200B Sorry for me english, i am currently from Brazil and trying to improve.;It sounds like you are not thinking about the use cases thoroughly enough and not doing enough error handling.  When bugs occur, it is because we do not understand the requirement or use case well enough.  What I personally do is that if it's a small feature, I'll spend some time thinking of every use case that I possibly can and trying to map them out to tests.  I cannot over-emphasize how important it is to understand the use-cases. This is where it all starts. I've spent hours bouncing use cases on major features with a team member. If you don't fully understand how something will be used, you will get bugs.#I’m by no means an expert on making good tests, but the few programming classes I’ve taken that have required us to make tests emphasize writing good tests.  Since methods are meant to only do one thing, your tests should only test one thing.  Start simple. Don’t test basic things that the language you’re using does for you (getters/setters, etc.) but make sure that everything works at a basic level before scaling up so it becomes easier to identify where problems occur if you have a solid foundation.  Something else that I’ve been experimenting with is Test Driven Development (TTD). Instead of writing a bunch of code and then trying to write tests, write your tests as you’re going along. If you can’t think of a way to test your method before writing it, then you may want to rethink your method.  Lastly, what I’ve found is that you need to distance yourself from your code and the fact you worked hard on it and want it to work and really try to break it. Don’t take anything for granted because users can come up with some really dumb things that could potentially break your code. Obviously you’re on a time crunch, but like someone else said, focus on use cases and think about where things can begin to go wrong.  Hopefully I helped! I’m still learning how to write good tests in my undergraduate studies, so i’d love to hear others’ feedback as well.

We mostly use SQL scripts and data analysis based on health care data.I have been trying to switch career. I know basic core java but then I felt Adv/JEE is a little too much for me and the number of tools they ask for Java position are way too many. Eventually I quit that. Then, I started hadoop with Scala (in the middle of it). Now, I understand what my strengths are (after experimenting with a couple of courses and making some mistakes/wasting time actually). I am very good with SQL/querying databaes. Though I am bad with syntaxes, I am very confident with logics/analysis (logical thinking). I talked to some of my friends working on big data. They told me it is very difficult to get into big data without knowing programming (either Java/Scala). I want to work something related to data but not really confident about my programming skills. Any suggestions on possible career path for me? TIA.;Big data without knowing java or Scala? I would say Python probably is the best language for Big data. At least that’s what I have seen on job postings and etc. As far as I know python is the most popular language foe that
excel;9myqli;1539172177.0;/r/excel/comments/9myqli/finding_duplicates_in_datasets_with_address/;Finding duplicates in datasets with address information (customer data).;Hey guys, I work daily with relatively big data sets where I have similar addresses under a single customer account where I have to check which addresses are duplicates and which aren't (please check the link below for an example). To further elaborate, usually an address has 4 main address lines, a City, a County/Province and a Postcode (and a country). My task is to decide if and address has matching data with any other on any of those address fields - there is a specific way in which addresses are set up - USPS for the States abbreviates items like street, avenue and parkway and usually everything is supposed to have its place in one of these address fields. But that is how it's supposed to be done and not how it is in most cases. What I want is to find a method or a tool through which I would be able to more easily juxtapose all these cells and find which ones are duplicates and which aren't and if possible to automate my work a bit - I have seen Fuzzy Lookup and other similar stuff, but I am not really certain how these can apply to my case. https://imgur.com/rj4uFn6Thank you in advance, guys :^);"I’m probably speaking out of turn here but the real merit of Fuzzy Lookup (at least as I’ve seen it) is around typo’s or variations in spelling (translations etc). So it might help you track down instances of “6300 LegacyDrive” or “6300 Lecagy Drive”.  Here though it seems that the strings are consistently entered but where they’re entered isn’t, so they’re not fuzzy so to speak. You might be better off with formulas.      =COUNTIF(Table[Addr_2],Table[@Addr_3])     =COUNTIF(Table[Addr_3],Table[@Addr_2])       would give you a very simple quick indication of duplication of a particular record.  Edit: another way might be to concatenate the address together for each row, and for each search if particular strings show up in the concatenated range. So =Addr_1&Addr_2& Addr_3&Addr_4 run down your data, and then in each row:      =COUNTIF($that$range,""*""&Table[@Addr_2]&""*"")"

Advice;9mir8c;1539032166.0;/r/Advice/comments/9mir8c/do_i_need_to_tell_my_bossprofessor_about_my/;Do I need to tell my boss/professor about my supervisor?;"Hello.&#x200B This is going to be asking advice and ranting.So I am working at a research lab in a university as a research assistant and I am also a student in the same university. I have a supervisor who is a postdoctoral student. We both working with a professor who is just giving us a big picture of project and we pretty much carry out whole project. I am from Japan and my supervisor is from China. He is smart in a way working with like big data and running arcane programs. I have some professional career having master's degree and I am in a Ph.D program. He works full time and I work half time. He does speak English but sometimes I feel I need more detail (I even might not convey enough detail here though and I will skip or vaguely say on purpose for my security) when he speaks to me or asks to do something. &#x200B So here is a problem. His working style is really not suit with me and it really stresses me out and I can't spend my time for study.Event1: We planned an experiment with college students and during a meeting he asked me what I would do for some moment of experiment. So I told something and he criticized my idea (I was expecting though) but said if you wanted to do it then do it. I was little confused because it is team project and I don't think I can conduct my own research in the middle of team research which is run by grant. And then nothing was decided during the meeting. But this happens all the time, he always set a meeting but never sit down together and talk about agenda. He just asks do you want to say something? Then I just say something that I have done related to experiment and then he said same thing again, if you want to do it do it. I am exhausted there is no progress because he always acts like if that's what you thought do it when my opinion is not even viable to act in research. I had three meetings for the same thing which is significant points of experiments and logistics and instructions.Event2: So I was supposed to write logistics and instruction to give our experimenters. Our experiment started on Monday and I finalized writing the last Thursday before the onset of experiment. I emailed him my writing and asked feedback. (Because I work only half-time, it is better not to show up in the lab even though I have work to do. People in my lab don't like people work overtime. But it is kind of usual that I work during weekend. :p) Anyway, he didn't emailed me until saturday night. So I sent reminder, if you don't have anything to comment I will send to professor and then I went to sleep. Next day, in the very early morning, he sent me email with a lot of comments and more work which was to prepare materials for experiment which would not complete for one day and said please finish today and sorry I didn't know there is this. I was so angry. He usually just texted me if something is emergency. But he didn't text me or email me anything about work he missed. And missing in action for a while when I asked feedback and throwing bunch of work when there is only one day to finish is not cool. Just not cool.Event3: He looks down on me very implicit way and I don't think he even recognizes it. Also, people in lab like him. What I mean by people in here is who does not directly work with him but more like people do administration or do other research project. Okay it is inevitably true that he knows better than me. But every time I ask something, he always snorts like if I am seriously asking. For instance, does it sound like a joke if I ask how many of college students he wants to have in experiment, or if I ask comment about my writing in research paper. He always snorts at my question. And that really drives me crazy. Also, one day I needed to set up new computer in the lab and asked how to install program. He snorted again and asked you just go to install.. I was like.. is this supposed to be instruction? So I asked other people in the lab and eventually, since he was the oldest who was in the lab, people told me to ask him and asked him by themselves. And then he was like suddenly furious and kind of looked upset and said ""I told you you install can't you do the simple thing? why you make me work?""I just can't work with him like this. The only reason I am remaining this lab is because I like their research itself. But now because of the issue with him, I am losing my motivation and enthusiasm. My professor asked me in front of him, if I like working in the lab. I said just yes because I had no choice and he and my professor had longer relationship and trust and I know I can't be a tattletale and I can't really intervene in their strong relationship.Please advise me what to do.. I was going to tell my professor in private one time, but I lost my courage because I was worried if I got fired and kicked out from the program.";"He sounds like an impatient arrogant idiot. You are there to learn/work not get stressed or anxious. Definitely talk to your professor about this guy#Okay so lengthy story but a lot of those things sound very familiar to me, having been in that whole environment (chem, but you'll find similarities anyhow).  On the first point: 'you can do it if you want to' to me it seems like maybe a cultural thing. I've worked with chinese before and they can be very hard to read to a dutch person like me as we're generally very direct and immediately say what we think. It's not the case for a lot of chinese people (at least in my experience) who are taught to say things in a more polite way, similar to the british. Basically, 'you can do it if you want' means 'no, I don't like the idea, prefer if you do something else'. I know that sounds silly, but no doubt this guy, like many others, has their own manual and sometimes you have to learn that the hard way. However, if it is unusual, feel free to urge him time to time to say what he really thinks. If his answer is not clear enough, you have to say that as I don't think he will be default.  Second point: It's impossible for us to assume we know somebody's schedule through and through. He likely had a good reason he could not get to your work earlier. And of course, as unfortunate as it is, I want to remind you that working in the weekend is already going beyond your normal working hours. I know, as a PhD you will probably do it plenty of times, but it should not be the standard. However, once again the guy is not doing his communication properly. He should have said if he had little time ""I will look over your assignment at this or that date"". This is for me the standard way my supervision has always done it and it makes it easier to plan ahead for you as well.   And of course you should also make it clear to him if he has an unrealistic standard for something. If you cannot complete something in one day, say it, or alternatively: do what you can do and tell him that you could not finish it. If he has anyone he should be angry on it's himself for failing at planning.  Third point: Hierarchy to a point is normal and I too was very used to phds looking down on masters who look down on bachelors etc etc. That does not make it good behavior. It is unacceptable for him to treat you like you are a child. You are an adult!  He is showing signs that either he has some really big problems going on in his life or he simply lacks sleep and it is seeping into his personality. He is screwing up the most detrimental tasks of communicating and planning. I do not automatically assume there is a bad intention. It may really be that he has little control over it and just cannot focus properly. All the more reason to urge your professor to take contact with him. You can let it be known you are worried about him and the way he does things makes your work inefficient. You don't have to be rude about it. You can be very polite. Your intention is to do your job properly and in order to do that you need a good relationship with this guy too. Your professor understands that. "

I have a slightly different question, that more or less relates.Consider the current state of the field:* CS/Engineering is currently widely considered to be a great field with high pay and lots of opportunities -> probably high number of college graduates* Tons of ""bootcamp"" programs that take your standard Accounting/Math/Electrical majors and train them for a couple months to become ""developers"". (probably something like Web devs with ReactJS experience and the like)As a fullstack, I can't help but feel that it's becoming more and more saturated. This is an assumption, I mention fullstack, because, well, I believe that's where the entry level developers go into, although I love fullstack and the mobility it gives you to work around the product end to end. Which makes me wonder, as an engineer that's already in the field, is there a branch of CS that will possibly maintain it's competitiveness in the future? Something that requires your prior experience, something that you would consider to be the 'next' level? For ex: Big data, ML, AI, blockchain, security, fintech etc.Thanks";"[deleted]#>Which makes me wonder, as an engineer that's already in the field, is  there a branch of CS that will possibly maintain it's competitiveness in  the future?   As long as these jobs continue to be high paying, no. People follow the money. It's just a fact of humanity. Even the fields you mentioned as ""next level"":  >Big data, ML, AI, blockchain, security, fintech etc.  these are all hot as hell right now and everyone wants to get into it. Imo, tech jobs that pay well or are trendy right now are saturated, i.e. machine learning at Facebook making $150K+ in NYC. Those jobs are tough to get because everybody wants them. But if you apply for a software engineer job at a bank in Florida using legacy code that pays $77K, those are much less desirable, and hence ""easier"" to get.  So basically, as long as you are aiming for the big paying jobs, it will continue to remain ""saturated"". It's true most people who apply won't be qualified. But money draws in everyone, including the really smart and capable folks. So there are more smart and talented people going into these jobs now more than ever. For example, instead of John at Harvard accepting his PhD offer at CalTech, he's gonna join a quant finance firm because, well, money. Or Harry with the high GPA in every class, who decided to quit pre-med to become a software dev because it's the much easier route."

I earned an Associates Degree in Software Engineering, and I’ve been working toward the Bachelor’s. The whole time I’ve had the intention of working in the game industry. That’s where my passion is. I’m not enjoying my classes, I feel like the curriculum is based around a whole different set of skills. I really don’t think I’m going to need to know the things they teach such as software security (sql injection attacks and whatnot) and big data. I get that they’re valuable things to know, I would be much happier teaching myself game engine architecture and how to program graphics. If I wanted to work for a small company making games, is it really worth these student loans to get the degree, or am I safe with some good games in my portfolio? I’m not trying to work for Bethesda or Blizzard, I want to just work from home on projects I’m passionate about. Thank you for reading!;Two people with the same portfolio the person with the bachelors wins.   HOWEVER! I've personally found that someone with an amazing portfolio with no degree beats someone with an average portfolio and a bachelors degree.   If I get to choose between two people one has a bachelors degree and the other was the lead programmer on a successful AAA or even indie project. I'll go with the latter.  Typically in programming though, most people have at least a bachelors.  I may be wrong take my advice with a grain of salt.#If you search here on the forum for “degree” and “career” you’ll find a lot of notes on that.  )  Short answer: It helps with visa, salary, understanding CS, and in case you want to work in a few specific research/dev areas.  I think due to the high competition these days it would help, my colleagues in AAA typically have a MSc CS.#I think the foundational skills and knowledge are more useful than you would expect. Especially on small teams, you have to be more of a generalist not a specialist. Now you do need to spend time learning some of the game dev specific stuff, but those other things will eventually be useful as well. If we're taking statistically, a bachelor's certainly increases your chances of industry. But if you had an in already, you wouldn't need to rely on it as much.

(“HTS”), a technological world leader in computer vision image processing-based solutions for Security, Safe Cities, Traffic Management, Parking Management, Law Enforcement, Surveillance and Access Control.HTS’ groundbreaking AI-based vision solutions are currently in use for sensitive Homeland Security anti-terror projects and discerning customers including: the Brookhaven National Laboratory for access control, JFK Airport, Newark Airport, La Guardia Airport, Boston’s Logan Airport, the U.S. Department of Transportation for readers at the US/Mexico border crossing, as well as a Florida municipality, and a Middle Eastern Homeland Security authority for the automated monitoring of sensitive zones.Inspired by time-critical “friend or foe” decision-making processes, HTS’ patented algorithms are based on a combination of cognitive science and machine learning-based (Artificial Intelligence) pattern recognition arbitrated through a multilayered decision-making process which offers both speed and accuracy.The Company believes that integrating HTS’ patented and proprietary AI technology into Quest’s existing Supply Chain offering will allow for automated logistics monitoring and optimization, creating operational efficiencies at the higher margins associated with the AI value-creation paradigm for both Quest and its Fortune 500 clientele. For the first six months of 2018, Quest reported revenues of approximately $29 million.For fiscal year 2018, HTS is expected to generate approximately $10 million in revenue with operational profitability and average gross margin of approximately 38% -- significantly higher than Quest’s average gross margin of 21%. Quest is purchasing HTS for $6.3 million, mainly paid in restricted shares at the average closing price for the trailing 20 trading days.Shai Lustgarten, CEO of Quest Solution, stated, “We are thrilled to bring innovative AI solutions to our Fortune 500 customers in the Supply Chain market. Adding new technology with Company-owned IP was a key goal that we articulated when new management embarked on the turnaround of Quest. This acquisition provides higher margin growth and transforms Quest’s business model by positioning the Company as a technological leader with state-of-the-art solutions in two multi-billion dollar, high growth markets:* HTS’ original Smart City and Homeland Security markets, with applications such as Automated Access Control, Parking and Traffic management* Quest’s original Supply Chain Management market with significantly higher margins gained by the integration of HTS’ AI technology“HTS’ AI technology will take our Supply Chain solutions to the next level, addressing essential needs in Law Enforcement, Homeland Security, Logistic Yard Management, Automation of Parking, Traffic Management and Security.”Additionally, HTS has a Salt Lake City-based facility that manufactures ruggedized computers and other electronics products for a long-term customer base. Quest expects to utilize this facility to support the manufacture of new white label products for its own Supply Chain solutions. The introduction of white label equipment is expected to enhance customer service while driving higher margins and revenue growth for Quest.”In addition to his role as CEO of Quest Solution, Shai Lustgarten is also a major shareholder and the CEO of HTS, and as a result, the acquisition constitutes a related party transaction. Mr. Carlos Nissenson, a principal shareholder of Quest, is also a principal shareholder of HTS. A special independent committee of the Board of Directors of Quest was established to consider the proposed transaction, and on their recommendation, the Board ordered an independent valuation analysis and a fairness opinion. The Board determined that the transaction is in the best interests of the Company, that the consideration payable by the Company pursuant to the transaction is fair to the shareholders of Quest, and unanimously approved the transaction (with directors who are conflicted, abstaining).ThinkEquity, a division of Fordham Financial Management, Inc., acted as financial advisor to Quest Solution, Inc.Mr. Lustgarten concluded, “As an executive of both companies, I sit in a unique position to see the operational benefits of bringing these two companies together and am pleased that the independent board committee came to the same conclusion after careful consideration. We look forward to this new chapter in the development of our Company and believe this acquisition will enhance our offerings and our leadership position to drive shareholder value.”**About Quest Solution, Inc.**   Quest Solution is a Specialty Systems Integrator focused on Field and Supply Chain Mobility.

Advice;9n26xg;1539196722.0;/r/Advice/comments/9n26xg/should_i_quit_my_job/;Should I quit my job?;[deleted];I would recommend first trying to become healthy if you are working 40 hours a week at your job. Do you exercise? Do you eat right? For me if I don't workout after a day on sitting at the computer or in general I just get super depressed and can't do work. I know your passionate about developing your game but that's something to work on while you develop your career. If worse comes to worse and you have to quit DONT until you get another position. Get recommendations from co workers if your boss won't give you one and find another position before you quit, and stay strong!#Along the lines of what /u/MobileWriter said. A big issue i see is that you work at home and this can lead to health issues. I've had some hella depression recently as I live on my own in a city where I don't really know anyone (especially now my course has finished), and a massive thing I've found is going outside the house and walking. If you work at home, on a computer, I'd guess you don't spend much time outside and actually looking after yourself.  Give yourself a bit of an exercise boost and see how you feel.  On top of this you should look at going out and socialising, find a club of people you like or a group that plays a game you like or some society somewhere. Get involved, people help you become happier, it's just awkward to start with.  After that you should consider the job - dreading dealing with your boss is a common occurence in many things and it fucking sucks, that's not a place you should work. But you should start looking after yourself first.  Further to that, follow your dream if it makes you happy.   &#x200B

socialism;9p1kox;1539802935.0;/r/socialism/comments/9p1kox/red_mirror_studygroup_about_technology_gender_and/;Red Mirror: Studygroup about Technology, Gender and Society.;Red Mirror is a studygroup based in southern Sweden. We wanted to bring the discussions we've been having online aswell. Check out our new subreddit:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/RedMirror/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedMirror/?fbclid=IwAR2hq5MpCyY-kn4KG1D3BElniy7qXVCck8PMaYzfn-k5STiDB08vId1REwc) We posed some questions in a text this spring which we'll add here aswell: **Introduction**The  modern world is changing rapidly.  The robots are coming and it is not  only the remaining factory workers  that may disappear: the jobs of  doctors, cashiers and teachers are  potentially at risk. At the same  time as sharing economies are born, companies like Spotify and Netflix  privatize  the free culture created by file sharing. While the medical  innovation  moves forward at a pace that makes the discussion of the  possibility of  human immortality more plausible then ever before,   millions die of curable diseases. Catastrophes amass as societal   development accelerates. As The Accelerationist Manifesto states: “In   contrast to these ever-accelerating catastrophes, today’s politics is   beset by an inability to generate the new ideas and modes of   organization necessary to transform our societies to confront and   resolve the coming annihilations. While crisis gathers force and speed,   politics withers and retreats. In this paralysis of the political   imaginary, the future has been cancelled.”. It is thus up to us to   create – or save – this future.   This is the beginning of a kind of [militant inquiry](https://www.viewpointmag.com/2013/09/25/introduction-to-the-study-of-militant-workers-inquiry/)  that we aim to run as a self-organized study group  both on- and  offline. Together we want to do things like read books,  articles,  sci-fi, watch YouTube clips, analyze statistics or whatever  interests  us. We want to find new points of view and lines of  questioning and do  away with the old. We want to create a space to  connect programmers,  migrants, communists, academics, transhumanists,  discarded superfluous  workers, cyborgs, factory workers, moms, union organizers and everyone  else who doesn’t only need to but who also must create a new world  before this one turns to shit.   In  this text we put forward our own  issues as a basis for future  discussion. Comment our text, share your  knowledge, study on your own,  invite us, join the our study group and  last but not least – fight! You have nothing to lose but your electronic  chains.**Post-Fordism and Political Visions**The  epoch we live in is post-fordist and has succeeded the previous fordist  era. Fordism was a society built upon the conveyor belt of the  automobile industry,  which became the model for hospitals, schools and  the rest of industry.  Fordism was built around relatively high wages  and the incorporation of  the domestic, national working class  into  capitalism, the expansion of the welfare state, the establishment  of  the nuclear family and the racist exclusion of minorities (Finns in   Sweden, black people in the USA). The vision of socialism created by the   labour movement of the fordist era corresponded the society that   created it: progressivism, democratic management of the means of   production and an end to wastefulness. Today, in a post-fordist society  these visions have faded by the way of on the one hand the triumph of  neoliberalism,  and on the other hand by way of the disappearance of  fordist factories  and modes of production. Therefore we have to ask the  same question as  Motarbetaren does in “Sisyfos klasskamp”(Sisyfos’  class stuggle): “What  proletarian believes that socialism and communism  could be about ruling  over McDonalds or Burger King? Who believes in  the democratic management  of a call center?”   So – we need a new  vision. Our question is, can we create this new vision by way of, for  example,  automation and big data? Is communism feasible in the form of a   digitalized planned or sharing economy or would it be something   different all together? Can we use Uber, AirBnB, the algorithms of   Amazon, Wal-Marts digitalized logistics etc, as models for new  possibilities in a global classless society? What do we have to hack?  How do we tear  specific capitalist technologies from their capitalist  roots? Is it  even possible? How can we create digital systems to serve  the people  instead of profit?**Gender Orders, Automation and Acceleration.**Instagram   filters, blue or pink children’s clothes, BBQ grills, birth control   pills, condoms, gender reassignment surgery and lipsticks  are all  examples of how the gender order is related to technology.  Without  these technologies it is difficult to see what gender would look  like  today. But what technologies are subversive or emancipatory and which  ones chain us to the gender order?   Fordism was built upon a specific  type of working class masculinity, in Sweden foremost in the form of the  “model worker” *(den skötsamme arbetaren).*  The male worker did the factory work, whereas his wife did the domestic  work (obviously things are more complicated then this, but generally  this an adequate description of the gendered division of labour). During  the post-fordist  era this division has gradually been erased, a great  deal due to  successful feminist struggles, but at the same time the  disappearance of  traditional male jobs has led to a “fear of falling”,   i.e. the development of reactionary tendencies in order to maintain   privileges and a relative position of power. At the same time more than   just classic industrial work is at risk of being automated.   Self-service-checkouts and robots to take care of the elderly are two   examples of how also feminized jobs could vanish. Could this perhaps   lead to development dissimilar to the masculine reactionary “fear of   falling”?**Global Perspectives**Automation  is part of a global trend. In China robots are expected to take over  tens of thousand of jobs over the  next couple of years. This will  potentially create huge changes for the  global capitalist structures  where the countries of the global south  maintain a form of fordist  production (with parallel political movements  and developments) and  ship their commodities to the global north. At  the same time economic  growth is shrinking in the global north,  presumably because of the  amount of dead labour that has taken over production. This is in turn a  major reason behind the decreasing state socialist ambitions of Social  Democratic movements: with shrinking economic growth comes shrinking  room for reform.  Global  migration is also shaped by technology, from  the self organized text  messaging chains migrants use to share  information on possible routes  and Frontex’ boats and guns, to the  destruction of local job markets or  the war machines that force people  to move. Kurds send pictures and film  clips from the whole world to  Afrin and Rojava and back. Creating  direct connections between people  and over borders is possible in way  unimaginable for previous  generations. The world is becoming ever more  connected and interwoven  at the same time as barbed wire fences and  walls are being erected.  Where are the holes in the fences? How can we  build a new  internationalism in theory and in practice from our small  city of Lund  to the rest of the world. In what way do the technologies we use affect  our efforts?  Environmental destruction is a process linked to migration  in which our world is laid to waste in varying paces from location to  location that in turn drives migration, for example due to drought. The  environment has been changed into a technical issue instead  of a social  one, a question of the amount of cans individuals choose to  recycle.  Yet the human race is not separate from nature (or technology  for that  matter). There is no “natural state of things” to preserve, but  there  is a world being exploited by capitalism. With the old slogan  “Think  globally – act locally” in mind we need to in a concrete manner   identify where and why this exploitation and destruction occurs at the   same time as we gain a scientific analysis and a social understanding   for environmental struggle and ecology.**Struggle and Revolution**Struggle,   just as any human relation always contains material and therefore also   technological relations. We need to learn from the insurrections of  the  last few years. Tunisia, Greece, Syria and Egypt are all situations  that  state and capital tried to cope with in different ways: from the  EU’s  austerity measures that went up against a SYRIZA completely  lacking in  political tools in the era of post-fordism, to the  militarisation of the Syrian rebellion which led to strict hierarchies,  masculinization and islamization of the resistance (all these   tendencies are interwoven). In Egypt the protesters won politically   against the military at the same time as they burned down around a   hundred police stations and thereby robbed the pigs of their bases.   After the protesters initial victories the rebellion was beaten in the   end in different stages by the ballot boxes, conservative islamists and   the military. In Tunisia “democracy” was the counter-revolution and   today the Tunisian politicians are on their hands and knees begging for a  bit of peace and quiet after the austerity politics the IMF has forced  upon the country. If  only the tourists could come back the nation (e.i  the national  capitalism) might rise like the phoenix from the ashes!  So,  counter-revolution has many faces, all of them interwoven binary,   materially, technologically and socially with each other.  Logistics   are central in the capitalism of today. Without a global network of   harbours, ships, electricity, trucks, computer systems, paved roads and   airplanes capitalism would collapse. “Globalisation” is really just   these things interwoven with a politically neoliberal push for   deregulation in order to maximize profits. Water is shipped from Austria   to Sweden  to be sold in grocery stores, oil is pumped in the Middle  East to be  used at a gas station in Lomma, mass quantities of plastic  garbage is  produced in China in order be shipped to us for a small  price, Volvo’s  factories are spread out all over Europe where each  factory and  subcontractor specializes on one small step of production.  This is the  weak link of modern capitalism:  [block one of ](https://beyondeurope.net/602/capitals-art-of-war/)these   nodes and everything falls like a house of cards. But where are theses   nodes and what is done there? What happens if we block them for an  hour?  Twelve hours? Ten days? Are logistical blockades, as a Danish  comrade  remarked, just possible as an activist version  of a short  strike in which you can strike at a particular company,  branch or  region while leaving the system itself unharmed?  How  can we wage  revolutionary struggle today when military drones and  aircraft are  dominant forces in war? We think that we need to study  insurrection as a  global, social and political struggle instead of  simply a military  struggle. This due to the hierarchization that war  entails which  quickly robs insurrection of it’s social character and  leads it back  into statehood. How can the revolution survive if Sweden’s  food supply  only lasts a week (since Swedish capitalism depends on food  imports)?  Could we coordinate a revolutionary uprising through Twitter  without  formal organizing? What do we do when they shut off the  electrical  grid, or when the workers at the nuclear power plants don’t  want to go  to work, or when they roll tanks into the cities? What  lessons can we  learn from the revolutionary wars of 1917 or 1936 and  what is obsolete?  These are questions that concern organization, what  knowledge we need  to learn and which social categories we need to act  together with  before the revolution comes.   The development in Rojava and the  neighboring territories might be the most important place to study.  As a  comrade who had visited Rojava told us: “The Kurds said that they   would have loved to call the international left instead of the USA for   help \[when Daesh/IS attacked\] but the international left probably didn’t   have an air force.”  These  are just a few of all of the questions  we’re asking ourselves. We hope  you will join our collective effort to  understand our digital,  technological world and also work to change it  with us!Organising Autonomously/Autonom Organisering, Spring of 2018;>  The male worker did the factory work, whereas his wife did the domestic work  i want to point out this in particular,  is largely a made up 1960s TV image, the proletariat has always been had a large amount of women  Also automation will slow down not accelerate, as it cannibalizes demand, as well as runs into resources constraints and diminishing returns from increasing technical hurdles.

In BC, you pay 5% GST on new-built homes only, and you never pay PST, but you always pay property transfer tax (which is like 2-3% depending on the value of the house.)#Keep in mind that there are many fees involved in house purchases across Canada   each is very locale specific.  Attorney Fees, Title insurance (optional), Homeowner's Insurance (situationally optional),  CMHC insurance (situationally optional) [Land Transfer](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/07/06/land-transfer-tax-inequality-canada_a_23476228/) and in some provinces HST is collected. (rather then GST/QST/PST)  &#x200B   &#x200B #It gets a little complicated. GST is 5% charged on new homes. QST is 9.975% charged on new and substantially renovated homes. There is a partial sales tax rebate on homes purchased as a primary residence.

Get a grasp on Python and R programming languages. However, I'm not a back end developer. I will do front end, and like to also specialize myself in stuff like, design for conversion.I do think big data is the future. Though it seems like very few agencies are actually making good use of it. Of course, you could say google analytics and facebook data. But I really mean getting the data from the cloud using Python. &#x200B Walmart collects more than 2.5 petabytes of data every hour from customer transactions alone for example.&#x200B Is it a good idea to do my minor in big data?;"In your Walmart example, they will generally partner with a data agency, sell them their data and then suppliers will buy aggregated data sets from the data agency.  Whilst there's a lot of ""big data"" out there, unless you're working in market research, the hard works already been done.  Even if you're working in market research, a lot of the data cleaning and processing which R and Python will teach won't be too useful. There's dedicated data science teams doing that.  Having said that, it's good to understand how the process works when you inevitably have to work with the data.#Depends on the size of the agency and vertical that you might want to focus on.   It sounds like you’re interested in a lot of different things - but, most companies will want someone that’s a specialist. For instance, one of the big4 consultancies will lock you in a basement for two years doing nothing but data work. They won’t care about your design or front end exp.   But - for a smaller agency, you’d be awesome. Let me know how it turns out. I’d likely want to interview you. "

Because of the arrival of digital transformation, business models are changing and now companies demand more than ever professionals who are capable of interpreting and analyzing large amounts of data to improve their performance, through the conversion of data in information.&#x200B [https://www.loadjobs.com/blog/what-should-i-study-to-be-a-big-data-expert](https://www.loadjobs.com/blog/what-should-i-study-to-be-a-big-data-expert);"Data science is a combination of statistics and software engineering.  But big data expert sounds too broad. Have thought about narrowing that down?  Some fields are generalist fields, and others are specialist fields. I'd recommend not trying to generalist in a specialist field.  But I really should ask what you mean by ""Big Data Expert""?  The assumption is that you would mean data scientist.  But if you really want to be an expert on big data, then you might actually want to be a generalist.  So if that is the case, then lmk because the convention wisdom of majoring is DS, CS, SE or Stats doesn't apply.  I hope that helps   Good luck#Look at job descriptions that are “big data scientists” or “big data whatever” and see what they require for a degree and other qualifications.

There is a 70% chance they will not get the project if they are only going after one project.   But with more experience under my belt. I would say stick with it for a year so that you are no longer a fresher and then leave. While you are there work on side projects since you are free and build up your github resume. It will be useful when looking for other jobs.  Just one thing do not leave this job without another job in hand, while you are working on your own things test the water go for interviews, see if you can find a company you like and if you do get one and get an offer then jump to them.

Most of their business these days is coming from Linux (Azure) and services (MSDN subscriptions, O365, Xbox). At this point, it seems like they could feasibly get away with open sourcing the OS and offloading the development process partially to the community and make bank Google-style.;I think it’s possible.  But I don’t think it’ll happen. If it did, I think it would be some new form of the OS. Open up the source of something that SO many people use especially businesses, means someone will be looking through it to make something malicious.  Some might find a way to fix those things too, but with the current Windows environment and the many years of people and companies managing them and updates the way they do it’d be too unlikely that enough people would get those updates unless they got it though the usual Microsoft processes. But the damage would be done by then I’m sure.  Plus all the hooks into their online services for synchronization and deep integration could expose other platforms like Active Directory, Microsoft Accounts, etc... to vulnerabilities.  There’s a lot at stake for them to open the existing OS to open source.  They do offer some source code to developers (don’t recall the requirements or what fees exist) already though. So it’s not impossible that they could make some things open source. But it seems risky to me.#Uh-huh. And the first thing would be done is deshitted fork without store, telemetry and UWP.

The guy has 20 years of experience so I thought to myself ""Great, finally I will get some help and this will take some pressure off of me"". Well, this has been totally opposite. The guy literally does not know a lot about the programming language we are using and I have to tell him basic things like why there is an error with the ""precompiled headers"". Yesterday I told him how to add a new class to the project. He is taking a couple of hours away from my day every day. That is all ok but what pisses me off is that  he is thankless and says things in the meetings like ""it takes a couple of hours for me to explain things to him and do basic things like add a project"". This is because I have to do magic things with Jenkins, xml and other infrastructure things to get things ready for that ass. When I started two months ago then no one was there to help me. But I am there to help him with every question he has. They probably planned him as a replacement for me because I was going slow due to lack of domain knowledge and I am a temp employee.**Health**The last few weeks have been terrible for my health. I have high blood pressure for the last three days and I wake up stressed with my remaining tasks. When my girlfriend comes to my house I am thinking about how I can speed up my task or how I will manage the delayed tasks in my meetings.**tl dr**I am tired of my current high pressure/tight deadline/no time to learn domain job and I want to change to an easier position where I can also enjoy my life. I am not looking for a testing job and I am ok with software engineering, management, big data or any other cs career position.  **I dont mind the ""CRUD"" jobs or easy jobs if the pay is good. What are some good alternatives for me? I live in the Netherlands if it matters.**";Please remember that all comments must be helpful, relevant, and respectful.

BlockchainStartups;9lb35g;1538653063.0;/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/9lb35g/the_blockchain_big_data/;The Blockchain & Big Data;The blockchain originated as the accounting backbone for Bitcoin, and it’s risen to prominence as cryptocurrencies have burst into the mainstream consciousness, collecting mind and market share along the way.However, despite all the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies, the blockchain has successfully cut through the noise and established itself as the natural successor to the current, flawed internet infrastructure. Many of the blockchain’s inherent features including its decentralized network, smart contracts, and tokenized transactions reconfigure the possibilities for data security and usability.Most networks are compromised because they have a single point of failure. With a big, bold centralized network to attack and little deterrence or chance of being caught, cybercriminals use rudimentary as well as technologically advanced mechanisms to steal user data. The blockchain’s decentralized network thwarts many of these attempts, and it has other features that advance its security enhancements.More specifically, sharding techniques, which further divide and distribute data among the already decentralized blockchain network, offer an additional level of protection that truly differentiates data storage on the blockchain. Sharding is not a new concept, and it’s frequently discussed as a technique that can support platform scalability, so it’s able to accommodate platforms of different sizes and developmental levels.When coupled with a tokenized ecosystem, these security features make user data more secure and usable than ever before. What’s more, platforms that adopt this methodology differentiate themselves from the existing tech incumbents that currently dominate the industry.Consumers can only have so much patience with companies that consume their data while treating it irresponsibly. Therefore, It seems likely that the next iteration of the digital age will favour companies that build compelling platforms that also value their customers’ privacy and secure their data by allowing them to maintain ownership over it.As the pendulum swings in the direction of privacy and security, organizations should be looking to the blockchain as the obvious next step toward embracing that change.Author: CEO Pavel Bains of #Bluzelle: [https://bluzelle.com](https://bluzelle.com/);

We recommend that businesses consider thefollowing steps to get the most value from blockchain:• Position your business operation as an early adopter by:– Identifying the most compelling use cases by considering the highest-value opportunities– Identifying discrete areas where the attributes of blockchains drive rapid impact– Using design thinking to simplify the user experience and create agile proofs of conceptto drive rapid adoption• Collaborate broadly to achieve globally accepted standards by:– Exploring the role of alliances and how profit pools might be redistributed. Then, decideon your role in building and piloting broader business networks– Consider the blockchain as the new business environment and collaboration as theoptimal way of working, then consider with whom you should partner to create theoptimal business network• Scale lines of business with clear revenue models by:– Looking for new sources of revenue as business models are disrupted by blockchain,for example, consumption-based pricing, licensing and micro-charges and payments– Exploring how new blockchain-based services and apps can replace, complement orscale existing revenue models– Understanding how blockchain might extract further value from other technologies,such as big data analytics, the Internet of Things, cognitive and cloud computing.With the Permian Token we developed a solution to solve the working capital requirements of oil exploration & production companies and oil exploration and production economies, meanwhile democratizing the direct investment sector for the average investor.The result, allowing seamless and transparent reporting of our world’s energy reserves and oil transactions under an immutable trust protocol (the blockchain). The PermianChain also solved theoretical and technological issues of oil exploration & production by allowing public and private sector to sell proven reserves yet to be produced via blockchaintechnology under a closed-loop-B2B-Exchange (the “PermianChain”). The PERMIAN Token Offering will launch 10 billion XPR tokens. It is our intention that at least 8.0 billion XPR will be sold during the Initial Token Offering (ITO) stages at $0.10 per token. Where we anticipate that 87.5% of the funds raised will go into oil campaigns and acreage withproven reserves. Whereas over 6% will be used to invest in continuous technology including blockchain and artificial intelligence for oil & gas exploration and production. Therefore, the total value of circulating XPR will eventually equal to the total value of Proven Reserves that are listed on the PermianChain.The XPR token offering will issue up to 8,000,000,000 ERC-20 tokens for investor contributions. Meanwhile, we will keep 1,000,000,000 tokens for treasury reserves to fund the community’s energy initiatives, mainly for geologists and oil & gas experts who have solid data and studies to work on.The XPR tokens will be backed by Proven Reserves that are identified by the oil campaigns that the XPR will invest in from the funds raised during the Initial Token Offering (referred to as “Oil Campaigns”) and by the oil exploration and production companies that list their own Oil Campaigns and Proven Reserves on the PermianChain platform (referred to as “Platform Prospects”). PermianChain tokenizes Proven Reserves to support Permian Token (XPR) related assets and operations. XPR enables digital transfer of underlying assets value in the form of digitized value of oil under standard conditions. Thus, allowing the utilization of XPR's substantial physical and Proven Reserves as a means to facilitate commercial and consumer transactions around the world. As a reserve digital currency, we expect XPR will become a critical instrument for preservation of wealth and an ever expanding range of commercial and consumer activities using blockchain technology for digitized store of value. ;

ico;9ksc4g;1538499109.0;/r/ico/comments/9ksc4g/challenging_ethereum_dbx_public_chain_offers_a/;Challenging Ethereum – DBX Public Chain Offers a New Business Application Model;As many of new public chains became available on mainnet this year and openly compete with blockchain product like Ethereum , 2018 has been known as ‘the first year of public chains’. Public chains have been drawing lots of attention in blockchain markets. DBXChain might be a main competitor to Ethereum in the near future.DBXChain, released by an internationally well-known public chain research team named DBX Foundation, is a value-based ecosystem of data based upon blockchain. This new value-based ecosystem is a decentralized data community that provides a platform for users to explore and exchange data. It provides a safe data exchange process and users are able to own their data rights. This new ownership with data is based upon blockchain technology.**Original DDPoS optimizes the consensus mechanism of blockchain**DDPoS is a new consensus mechanism that is created by DBXChain for the first time in the world. It helps resolve oligarchy and security issues from DPoS consensus mechanism by EOS. As everyone knows, DPoS consensus mechanism is similar to a shareholding system and its problems are quite obvious: first, it has a low voting rate.More than 90% shareholders never voted. It is because it takes time, energy and skills to vote, which are what most investors do not have. Additionally, there are many challenges dealing with bad nodes. If interfering nodes can’t be checked during a community election, it will put web security at risk.Then, how does DDPoS help resolve security and oligarchy issues while keeping its capacity at the same level? DDPoS makes the whole node selection system “fluid” so that block producer becomes a role, not a node, and this role can be transferred to other candidate producers at any time.With continuous data exchange at the bottom level of DBX public chain, the coupling level between a node and the whole ecosystem will be counted into an election system using weighted algorithm. During this process, users can vote at anytime, and DBXChain thus helps dodge potential bribery and security issues under DPoS system.**Enhance TPS and improves consensus efficiency**Blockchain is a distributed system, and a main factor that affects TPS is networks. Due to a large amount of nodes in a blockchain network are scattered around the world, the web state of each node is uncontrollable and it is hard to set a requirement to their bandwidth or to make sure everyone have access to stable network. This kind of situation is absolutely a disaster to TPS.Compared with underlying systems of “classic blockchain” such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, DBXChain is able to support more nodes– more than ten thousand nodes, and allows users to sign up and quit at anytime. The algorithm uses a voting system among potential block producers and cryptography techniques to improve algorithm’s efficiency. Similar to PBFT Prepare/ Commit, the use of aggregated signatures reduces the size of voting signature from nodes and therefore reduces the use of bandwidth. It also requires to exchange data twice for a block among all confirmed nodes. In additional to provide a good security, it efficiently improves consensus performance of BFT.**Building a win-win ecosystem base on big data**DBXChain has massive data, also many users and clients as resources for support, which make this program special. Many projects invested by Top Venture Capitals had ecological cooperation with DBX. Thus, DBX Chain is able to merge a large amount of support and resources from these projects, which is absolutely a good starting point.As it shows, the consensus mechanism by DDPoS has a promising future. These well-known resources in China chose DBXChain because they all needed internet that not only had high capacities, but was also highly secure and was able to prevent manipulations and bribery. All these requirements were met by DBXChain. In fact, DBXChain will support many developed businesses, which already has a large volume of data on classical internet. These data will test the capacity of DBXChain internet and its security. It is also why the new consensus mechanism of DDPoS and its public chain can outperform Ethereum and EOS in terms of democratization and security.**DataGame benefits its participants**DataGame is a DApp for crowd-sourcing data collection , where DBX demonstrates capacities and feasibility of its public chain. Every data collector can launch a data collecting game using a certain amount of DBX coins in areas such as AI, purchases and IOTs. Owners of data can get rewards by participating in games. They can also search data needed with high accuracy and pay for a specific amount based upon data size.DataGame has largely lowered prerequisites to participate for data owners, making more valuable and long-tail data available for sharing. Additionally, DataGame has also reduced costs to obtain data so that more users are able to achieve goals and get a brand new experience in data exchange in the blockchain world. As we can see, for DBX to build a new data infrastructure, the first step is to use DataGame.Obviously, the third generation of big data ecosystem will be more common, but this area will eventually become the most competitive among blockchain tycoons. In the face of big rival, we are looking forward to seeing if Ethereum will still be a leader in the public chain competition.; Worth mentioning thing that 20 %  of attracted funds will be spent for PR, marketing services and expansion of the project.

I am a 24 year old living in California and I can't decide what to pursue as a career. My ultimate goal is to get a solid career making around 6 figures. I currently have a Bachelors in Business Management Information Systems and work as a contractor for Apple. I can't disclose the actual job title due to NDA reasons but it is a technician position working with software. The issue is the position isn't really the field I wanted to be in and only took the job because it was Apple and it paid decently at about 25 an hour. Based on the project I am working on, it is unlikely that they'll hire full time after the contract ends next year. I could try finding similar positions in the field since I would have a year experience at Apple and that would be a good stepping stone. I do kinda want to becone a data analyst/scientist since I find the field of big data to be quite fascinating. But it's kinda hard to find a position since my background isn't fully in data and my experience is quite limited. I am considering also going back to school for an MBA but wouldn't know what I would want to pursue after. The closest thing I have to a dream job is becoming a psychiatrist. I am a very empathic person and have personally dealt with/still dealing with depression to the point of almost committing suicide. If I could make a career in helping others where I have struggled would be a dream come true. However becoming a psychiatrist would require going to Med School and then training right after and I don't quite have the money to afford it. Not to mention that I don't have a degree in any sciences and it would be a huge uphill battle. So at this point in my life I have no idea which career path I should pursue. What would you recommend? TLDR: 24y/o with Business MIS degree can't decide between trying to go for Med School, following career in field I don't like but building experience for, attempt to be data scientist/analyst, or getting an MBA. ;

CryptoCurrency;9ksjfs;1538500424.0;/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9ksjfs/challenging_ethereum_dbx_public_chain_provides_a/;Challenging Ethereum — DBX Public Chain Provides a New Business Program Model; * **Challenging Ethereum - DBX Public Chain Offers a New Business Application Model***As many of new public chains became available on mainnet this year and openly compete with blockchain product like Ethereum , 2018 has been known as ‘the first year of public chains’. Public chains have been drawing lots of attention in blockchain markets. DBXChain might be a main competitor to Ethereum in the near future.*DBXChain, released by an internationally well-known public chain research team named DBX Foundation, is a value-based ecosystem of data based upon blockchain. This new value-based ecosystem is a decentralized data community that provides a platform for users to explore and exchange data. It provides a safe data exchange process and users are able to own their data rights. This new ownership with data is based upon blockchain technology. *  **Original DDPoS optimizes the consensus mechanism of blockchain****DDPoS is a new consensus mechanism that is created by DBXChain for the first time in the world.** It helps resolve oligarchy and security issues from DPoS consensus mechanism by EOS. As everyone knows, DPoS consensus mechanism is similar to a shareholding system and its problems are quite obvious: first, it has a low voting rate.More than 90% shareholders never voted. It is because it takes time, energy and skills to vote, which are what most investors do not have. Additionally, there are many challenges dealing with bad nodes. If interfering nodes can’t be checked during a community election, it will put web security at risk.Then, how does DDPoS help resolve security and oligarchy issues while keeping its capacity at the same level? DDPoS makes the whole node selection system “fluid” so that block producer becomes a role, not a node, and this role can be transferred to other candidate producers at any time.With continuous data exchange at the bottom level of DBX public chain, the coupling level between a node and the whole ecosystem will be counted into an election system using weighted algorithm. During this process, users can vote at anytime, and DBXChain thus helps dodge potential bribery and security issues under DPoS system. * **Enhance TPS and improves consensus efficiency****Blockchain is a distributed system, and a main factor that affects TPS is networks.** Due to a large amount of nodes in a blockchain network are scattered around the world, the web state of each node is uncontrollable and it is hard to set a requirement to their bandwidth or to make sure everyone have access to stable network. This kind of situation is absolutely a disaster to TPS.Compared with underlying systems of “classic blockchain” such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, DBXChain is able to support more nodes– more than ten thousand nodes, and allows users to sign up and quit at anytime. The algorithm uses a voting system among potential block producers and cryptography techniques to improve algorithm’s efficiency. Similar to PBFT Prepare/ Commit, the use of aggregated signatures reduces the size of voting signature from nodes and therefore reduces the use of bandwidth. It also requires to exchange data twice for a block among all confirmed nodes. In additional to provide a good security, it efficiently improves consensus performance of BFT. * **Building a win-win ecosystem base on big data****DBXChain has massive data, also many users and clients as resources for support, which make this program special.** Many projects invested by Top Venture Capitals had ecological cooperation with DBX. Thus, DBX Chain is able to merge a large amount of support and resources from these projects, which is absolutely a good starting point.As it shows, the consensus mechanism by DDPoS has a promising future. These well-known resources in China chose DBXChain because they all needed internet that not only had high capacities, but was also highly secure and was able to prevent manipulations and bribery. All these requirements were met by DBXChain. In fact, DBXChain will support many developed businesses, which already has a large volume of data on classical internet. These data will test the capacity of DBXChain internet and its security. It is also why the new consensus mechanism of DDPoS and its public chain can outperform Ethereum and EOS in terms of democratization and security. * **DataGame benefits its participants****DataGame is a DApp for crowd-sourcing data collection , where DBX demonstrates capacities and feasibility of its public chain.** Every data collector can launch a data collecting game using a certain amount of DBX coins in areas such as AI, purchases and IOTs. Owners of data can get rewards by participating in games. They can also search data needed with high accuracy and pay for a specific amount based upon data size.DataGame has largely lowered prerequisites to participate for data owners, making more valuable and long-tail data available for sharing.

Abra’s Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Token (Bit10) will track the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and rebalance monthly. Abra stressed that the new token is not a fund. Instead, the token utilizes smart contracts to peg an investor’s cryptocurrency or fiat holdings to Bit10.  * Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange headed by the Winklevoss twins, has obtained insurance coverage for the digital asset holdings under Gemini’s custody. In a press release Wednesday, the firm detailed that insurance coverage is being provided by global professional services firm, Aon. Gemini also maintains Federal Deposit Insurance Corporations (FDIC) insurance for dollar deposits held by the exchange.  * IBM has been awarded a patent by the US Patent and Trademark Office for a blockchain-based secure system. IBM first filed for this patent in September 2017. The patent details blockchain technology that can detect security breaches within a network by connecting monitors to a chain configuration. In late September, IBM was awarded a patent for the autonomous self-servicing of networked devices that would form an Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry environment.  * In a press release Wednesday morning, TD Ameritrade announced they are backing new cryptocurrency exchange, ErisX. ErisX has plans to reveal their full business plan later today, although a report by Bloomberg details ErisX will begin selling cyptocurrency futures contracts in early 2019 while also offering services for investors to trade BItcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. TD Ameritrade currently provides retail investment services to almost 11 million clients. According to Bloomberg, high-speed trading house Virtu Financial and investing company DRW holdings are also participating in the investment into ErisX.  * JP Morgan’s recent efforts to expand blockchain technology operations is part of a larger digital technology roadmap, according to a press release published by ResearchAndMarkets.com. The press release details that blockchain technology is on the top priority of JP Morgan, while other technologies being pursued by the bank include big data, cloud operations, artificial intelligence, and robotics. JP Morgan reportedly has set aside USD$10.8 billion for technology spending in 2018, USD$5 billion of which is set to go towards fintech investments.  * The Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense has sent a questionnaire to cryptocurrency exchanges whose bank accounts were closed by major Brazilian banks. The Brazilian antitrust regulator sent questionnaires to 10 cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bitcoin Market, Bitambio, BitcoinTrade, and Brazilex. This move by the Brazilian regulator comes shortly after launching a probe into six major Brazilian banks for the alleged unlawful closing of cryptocurrency exchanges’ bank accounts.  * The Israel Securities Authority has begun to implement blockchain technology into its messaging system, according to an article by the Times of Israel. The purpose of the blockchain implementation is to improve the regulator’s cybersecurity. The Israel Securities Authority reportedly has plans to implement blockchain technology into an online voting system as well as an information database in the near future.    **Sources:**r/https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-abra-launches-fund-backed-token-product-for-investors/   r/https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-assets-on-winklevoss-gemini-exchange-are-now-insured/   r/https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-abra-launches-fund-backed-token-product-for-investors/   r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/ibm-awarded-patent-for-secure-system-based-on-blockchain   r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-brokerage-firm-td-ameritrade-to-invest-in-new-crypto-exchange   r/https://www.ccn.com/td-ameritrade-trading-giant-virtu-invest-in-u-s-cryptocurrency-exchange/   r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/jpmorgans-focus-on-blockchain-is-part-of-digital-transformation-roadmap-new-study-reveals   r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazil-antitrust-watchdog-sends-questions-to-crypto-exchanges-after-bank-account-closures   r/https://cointelegraph.com/news/israel-securities-authority-turns-to-blockchain-for-improving-cybersecurity   r/https://www.coindesk.com/israels-securities-watchdog-builds-blockchain-into-its-messaging-tool/ ;
CryptoCurrency;9kryq7;1538496598.0;/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9kryq7/dbxchain_dbx_public_database_x_blockchain/;DBXChain: DBX Public Database X Blockchain & DataGame DApp Set To Launch;**What Is DBXChain?**The DBXChain is a new public chain that has been created by the DBX Foundation. It intends to be a value-based ecosystem of data that will be made on the blockchain. This new ecosystem will create a decentralized community that will be able to provide a platform for people who want to use it.This network will be able to provide a safe data exchange process and to allow its users to own their data, unlike many companies that create products that basically steal the data from the user. The DBX Foundation believes that the users are entitled to the data that is produced by them and not the owners of the platform.According to the company, real decentralization can only be found when ownership of data is based on the rights of each person and this can be done via the blockchain technology.**How DBXChain DBX Public Database X Blockchain Works**DBXChain uses a new type of consensus mechanism that is still unseen in the community, the DDPoS consensus mechanism.  The DDPoS is an evolution of the DPoS consensus used by the EOS platform. It was created to solve issues with security and even oligarchies that can arise because of the way in which the technology is structured.The DPoS consensus system is similar to a shareholding system, but it has some obvious problems like a low voting rate. According to data, only 10% of the shareholders have ever voted, which means that 90% have not.It takes time and even skills to vote in a system and that is why most people will simply never decide to do it. Also, the way in which nodes cannot be checked sometimes might create security risks. The new DDPoS system makes the node selection to be more fluid and the block producers become a role, not a node. This makes each role able to be transferred to other candidates at any time.This way, the company believes that by having a continuous data exchange at the lowest level and combining the node system with elections, they can be more efficient as the users will be able to vote whenever they want.Also, the company intends to improve the speed and the TPS of the network. As the blockchain is made of many nodes that are scattered around the world, the web state of each node is not controllable and it impossible to ensure that anyone will have a stable network.DBXChain will support more nodes than classic blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, about ten thousand of them. Also, the system used by the company reduces the bandwidth used by the nodes by using aggregated signatures.The main idea of DBXChain is the creation of a public chain that can be massive and an upgrade when compared to other popular solutions like Ethereum. The company intends to use big data to create a win-win ecosystem that will be used for many projects.With its own consensus system, the company affirms that, after a certain period of time and tests, the network will be able to surpass the quality and the structure of the Ethereum and the EOS Network.**A DBXChain Dapp: DataGame**One of the examples that the company has used to showcase the abilities and possibilities of the network is the DataGame decentralized application. It was created to be used as a way to crowdsource data collection.Data collectors can use the platform to launch a data collecting game using DBX coins as rewards for people collecting data. They reward the participants of the game that help them to get highly efficient and accurate data. This can make more long-tail data available for sharing and help new data researchers with fewer resources.; Good idea and responsible team of developers. I think that there are no obstacles on the way to hard cap. Projects with the same ideas look not so detailed #All interaction in this system is based on the value of certain data, am I a parv? That is, it gives a different company the opportunity to trade it freely, right?
